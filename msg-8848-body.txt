Hello, List!
Here are the listings as of Jan 14, 2015.


Listings Project Story of the Week:

I decided to post on Listings Project since I appreciate the curatorial a=
dvantage it offers over other more traditional sources of publication. I =
must admit I was highly skeptical, not of the mailing list's effectivenes=
s, but of being able to find in less than 4 weeks a subletter for a very =
specific range of dates in a season with high subletting offers. A few ho=
urs after the listing went out I received 4 interested persons, the first=
 of which sealed the deal. Thanks, you have successfully contradicted my =
skepticism! -Daniel


Best,
Stephanie

$1,400.00 Per Month, Clinton Hill/Navy Yard, Brooklyn, Plenty Of Spaces A=
vailable In Beautiful Newly Renovated Bldg! Huge Range Of Sizes/Prices Av=
ailable!
Available: Jan 01, 2015

To anyone looking for a great new studio space to work in, I have been as=
ked to refer you to a new art studio project. I&#39;ve had my studio in t=
he same building for many years now, and it truly is a wonderful place to=
 work!=20

Because it&#39;s a brand new build out, there are many different spaces a=
vailable. The prices begin at $1025-$1350 for the medium-large ones. All =
have massive windows, and and are perfect size for sharing.

And then there are the truly enormous spaces with FAR more space and even=
 more windows. These range anywhere from $1400 - $4000.=20

Each space will have plenty of light and ventilation, as well as a heat a=
nd AC unit in every space. The building also provides gorgeous rooftop vi=
ews, 24 hour access and security, and an enormous loading dock and freigh=
t elevator.=20

For those not familiar with the area, it&#39;s generally thought of as a =
safe, quiet Brooklyn neighborhood. The building is just a few blocks from=
 the G train, with plenty of food options and easy street parking.

I have had my own art studio in this building for almost 4 years, and the=
 management has asked me to help get interest in the new spaces as they a=
re expanding the number of studios in the building. I will be the one sho=
wing the spaces and there are absolutely NO fees involved.

If you&#39;re interested, please text Jordan. I look forward to hearing f=
rom you. Thanks!

$550.00 Per Month, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, 200 sq. ft., Charming office/stu=
dio available in prime Greenpoint  (includes utilities)
Available: Jan 01, 2015

A semi-private space is available immediately (move-in date negotiable) f=
or sublease in my studio, approximately 200 square feet for $550, utiliti=
es included (heat &amp; electricity). The ceilings are 11 feet high, so i=
t feels larger. The entire 600 sq foot studio is shared with two other pe=
ople - my space is in the back and completely private with a door, while =
your space is in the middle, divided from the other studio with a partial=
 wall, which goes all the way up to the ceiling. There are no windows, bu=
t abundant wall space and a small storage loft. Perfect for a painter.

The charming space has one exposed brick wall, and original details of wo=
od ceiling, beams and floor. It feels very comfortable and homey in there=
, great place to work. The photos feature my previous studiomates&#39; st=
uff, but it&#39;s best to take a look at it in person and see how you wou=
ld set it up yourself.

There is a freight elevator, mailbox, slop sink, clean bathrooms, and 24-=
hour access to building. Many artists and creative professionals in the b=
uilding.

Amazing, prime location, just 2 blocks from the G at Greenpoint Ave and w=
alking distance to tons of great bars, shops, and restaurants.

I prefer someone with a quiet practice - no woodworking (occasional is ok=
), loud machines, or toxic materials. It&#39;s also preferable if you wor=
k mostly nights and weekends since I work mostly weekdays, but not a requ=
isite. Also, I&#39;m only renting to an individual to keep the # of peopl=
e in the space to a minimum, no duos or groups. I require first month&#39=
;s rent plus 2 months security deposit. The lease is for one year, but if=
 you need to leave before then, you can give me 45 days notice.=20

$600.00 Per Month, East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 400 sq. ft., Studio Share=
 in Great Location - Quiet Artist Filled Building
Available: Jan 19, 2015

Hi,

I am a 26 year old photographer from Michigan and have been working in Ne=
w York for three years. I recently rented out a nice studio space in East=
 Williamsburg where I go to shoot some things after work and on the weeke=
nds. It is a decent sized room with wooden floors, four windows that brin=
g in a lot of natural light, electric heating, free high-speed wifi, and =
it is in a great neighborhood. I&#39;m finding that there is a lot of tim=
e that the space could be used by another artist, and I don&#39;t use a g=
reat amount of it while I&#39;m there. There is plenty of space for someo=
ne else to work.

I&#39;m looking for someone considerate and trustworthy. I&#39;m not some=
one to make demands, so it would be best if we understand each other and =
can work on the same page. Individuals only, no groups or businesses, and=
 prefer quieter practices.

If you have any questions or would like to see more pictures please get i=
n touch and tell me a little bit about what you&#39;re looking for.

Thanks,

Jackson

io Available in 56 Bogart
Available: Feb 01, 2015

Hello! We have a lovely 200-sf studio space opening up in an 800-sf share=
d space at 56 Bogart in Bushwick, Brooklyn, available for rent starting F=
ebruary 1. The 800-sf space is divided into four quadrants of 200-sf each=
, so each artist has his or her own semi-private space with plenty of wal=
l space and ambient natural light. We are three friendly interdisciplinar=
y artists primarily working in sculpture, and despite our tendencies towa=
rd controlled messes (light woodworking, plaster casting, and paper-mache=
), we are very tidy, respectful of space and dust, and try to keep a peac=
eful and positive atmosphere. We hope to find a fellow studio mate whose =
work and practice fits with this general vibe.

General info about the building:
 24/7 access
 freight elevator
 super on duty during business hours
 heat and electricity included (no internet)
 11&#39; ceilings
 wood floors
 directly across from the L train at Morgan Ave.

Please let us know if you&#39;re interested or want to know more about th=
e specifics of the space, and we can set up a visit.

$1,700.00 Per Month, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Apx. 100 sq. ft., Awesome 1B=
R/1BA in a beautiful partially furnished 2BR/2BA apartment off of the Gra=
ham L. With an awesome dog.
Available: Feb 01, 2015 through Feb 01, 2016

- Rent is $1700/month, and you&#39;ll need a security deposit and first m=
onth.
- You&#39;ll be signing the lease with me for a year, so this is a long-t=
erm deal.
- Utilities are usually around $60-100 a month (Gas, electricity, interne=
t)
- You&#39;ll be living with a Boston Terrier, who is pretty awesome, so i=
f you&#39;re thinking of moving in, you need to be a dog person.
- The apartment is furnished other than your bedroom and bathroom
- 2 minute walk from the Graham L, 7 minutes to Manhattan
- Second floor bedroom with own bathroom
- Washer and dryer in apartment
- Dishwasher and stainless steel appliances
- Balcony on the first floor
- Awesome, huge private roof terrace on the second floor with great views=
 of the city
- Furnished living room and kitchen, all you need is bedroom furniture
- Huge windows in every room
- Storage unit in basement

My roommate is moving to Manhattan and isn&#39;t going to renew our lease=
, so I need someone chill to live with.

The apartment is super nice, pretty new (built in 2010), and convenient; =
about a 2-minute walk to the Graham L. It&#39;s two floors with the secon=
d floor being your bedroom, with your own full bathroom and access to the=
 huge private roof terrace. I&#39;m not sure of the exact sq. footage of =
the room, I&#39;d say roughly 100 sq. ft., but there&#39;s currently a fu=
ll bed, computer desk, dresser, and a clothes rack with space left over. =
It&#39;s a loft bedroom, so there&#39;s no door, but it&#39;s still super=
 private and I don&#39;t stay in the living room very late at night.=20

Downstairs, there&#39;s a nice kitchen, with a dishwasher and bar to eat =
at that joins the living room, along with my bedroom, the first floor bat=
hroom, and a closet. There&#39;s a balcony on the first floor, and the af=
orementioned roof terrace is accessible from the second floor with great =
views. The apartment also has a washer and dryer. The kitchen and living =
room are furnished, so all you&#39;d really need is bedroom furniture.

A bit about myself, I&#39;m a 26 year old guy from Virginia, super laid b=
ack, and pretty cleanly. I&#39;ve been in NYC for almost 4 years now, and=
 have lived in this apartment for the past 2. I&#39;m a graphic designer =
and work in tech, standard 9-5 job. I&#39;m usually home most nights. Whe=
n I&#39;m not at work, I&#39;m probably hanging out with Beef (your poten=
tial Boston Terrier roommate), reading, watching every BBC show on Netfli=
x, or drinking bourbon. I don&#39;t really bring the party home, but I do=
 enjoy hosting parties a few times a year.

You&#39;ll be on the lease, which starts February 1st, 2015 and is throug=
h February 1st, 2016. The management company will need all the standard l=
ease signing stuff: recent paystub, last year&#39;s tax return, ID, secur=
ity deposit, etc. Please keep in mind that I&#39;m looking for at least a=
 year commitment. Your room is $1700/month, I&#39;m paying a bit more bec=
ause my bedroom is a bit bigger.

I&#39;ve attached pictures of the bedroom, bathroom, and terrace from whe=
n I moved in, as well as pictures of the living room and kitchen now. I c=
an send more recent photos of the bedroom and bathroom, I just need to ge=
t around to cleaning everything first.

Wall of text, I know, but it&#39;s a great apartment, and I&#39;d love to=
 live with someone who&#39;s as into as I am.

$1,100.00 Per Month, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, 125 sq. ft., Large room in lov=
ely, sunny spacious apt
Available: Feb 01, 2015

Hi all,=20

I have 1 bedroom available in a three bedroom apartment in Greenpoint. Th=
e place is located on Nassau Avenue and Hausmann street, across from the =
b48 bus stop (takes you to G or Lorimer L), a few blocks from McGolrick p=
ark, and off the Nassau G stop.=20

The apartment is beautiful: high ceilings throughout (11ft), real wood fl=
oors, giant windows (6ft+), beautiful light, room to breathe.=20

Living room has two giant windows and 1 little window, lots of succulents=
, is mostly furnished and has room to entertain. Kitchen is a galley that=
 is great for cooking, complete with tons of counter space, storage and e=
ven a pantry! Bathroom has a real tub, great water pressure, a linen clos=
et and is also large.=20

The bedroom for rent has 2 large windows, also has a large closet with sh=
elves. The rooms are oriented differently but all well sized, with room f=
or large bed, table, chair, dresser, etc. Approximately 125 square feet.=20=


Added bonus: the roof is amazing! Its unfinished, but offers awesome view=
s of the city and is really nice to hang out on in the warmer months. I h=
ave watched July 4th fireworks up there from both the East River and Huds=
on. Landlord is super attentive and has taken care of issues efficiently =
and painlessly. Neighbors are rad.=20

I have lived in this home for 2 years and I love this apartment and neigh=
borhood. The area is quiet and calm, but close enough to bars, parks and =
restaurants, a super quick bike ride or approximately 10 minute walk to M=
anhattan ave. We are right next door to great local bar Greenpoint Height=
s and near the Farmer&#39;s market in the park, Met foods, Vinnie&#39;s p=
izza, bodegas, laundry, Brooklyn Standard and Variety coffee.=20

I am a 30-something female designer who works full time in the city, and =
am looking for a cool calm adult who will keep a safe clean home and have=
 good senses of humor. The other roommate is a 30 something woman who is =
really sweet and an excellent cook. Be cool, fun and neat and we will get=
 on great. I am super friendly and hope to continue having my apartment b=
e a homey atmosphere where we all can be pals and have our moms stop by w=
ithout being horrified. Hoping to find someone who is not looking to brin=
g the party home every night or weekend, and doesn&#39;t keep super late =
hours during the week (or if they do they aren&#39;t crazy loud).=20

Ultimately I am looking for someone who is good at being a grown up, good=
 at having fun, doesn&#39;t live like a frat boy, and wants to make this =
space a home. I sometimes have friends over for dinner or drinks or games=
, and you should do. Unless they smell bad then you probably shouldn&#39;=
t. :)

Utilities will be split 3 ways evenly, add up to less than $80 per month-=
-including heat, wifi and gas.=20

No pets, no smoking cigarettes inside, no couples. Need deposit and first=
 month&#39;s rent to move in. Write me a little note about you, your sche=
dule, interests and existence. Looking forward to meet you.=20

Thanks and good luck!

t Great Location
Available: Jan 17, 2015

Hi!

We are three stellar roommates looking for a fourth! Who we are: David - =
a city planning wizard and chef extraordinaire, Leslie - a choreographer =
who has a sweet dance company here in the city and plays guitar from time=
 to time, and Brandon - a male model who&#39;s significantly smarter than=
 Derek Zoolander but just as much fun. We like to hang out with our roomm=
ates, have dinners together sometimes and even play board games from time=
 to time. If you&#39;re an easy going, friendly person, you&#39;ll fit ri=
ght in.

The apartment is right off of Bedford Avenue north of the Williamsburg Br=
idge. So you can bike ride over the bridge into Manhattan, or walk 8 minu=
tes to the L or J,M,Z trains.=20

The room available is the largest in the apartment - it&#39;s $1600/month=
 plus $100/month utilities. Available Jan 17. It&#39;s 11 x 11 with two w=
alls of windows. Full size bed, dresser, desk and chair etc. It&#39;s jus=
t big, sunny and comfortable!

One month sec deposit to move in. Minimum 3 months stay and then month to=
 month after that.=20

The living room and kitchen are quite large with very high ceilings and b=
eautifully decorated. Also a brand new modern kitchen with a dishwasher, =
cheap washing machine in the hall way right outside the front door.  And =
it looks like they may be reopening the roof (finished and beautiful) thi=
s summer!

There is alternate side parking - so it&#39;s free and pretty easy to fin=
d a spot, but you&#39;ll just have to move it to the other side of the st=
reet on cleaning days.

If you&#39;re interested, reply to Leslie through the craigslist link.

$850.00 Per Month, Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, 90 sq. ft., Small bedroo=
m with Murphy Bed in fully furnished 2 BR apartment
Available: Feb 01, 2015

Looking to rent the smaller of two bedrooms in a full floor of a recently=
 renovated brownstone in Bed Stuy, near Saraghina restaurant.=20

It is a fully furnished apartment that includes everything you need in th=
e kitchen. I love to cook and enjoy having people over for dinner as well=
 as occasional guests from out of town but the apartment is most often a =
quiet, peaceful, and a lovely place to spend time away from the hectic te=
mpo of the city. You should be able to get an idea of the feel of the pla=
ce from the photos.=20

I am a gay male and a professor upstate (where I own a house) and I am on=
ly in the apartment in Brooklyn for 1/2 of each week: Friday thru Tuesday=
, with occasional longer stays during school breaks but often travel and =
may not be here for several weeks at a time. I teach dance practice and a=
m an historian of performance, cinema, architecture and urbanism and am a=
lso a choreographer and light, digital video and sound artist.=20

The apartment is furnished with mostly mid-century pieces and is very cle=
an and I have an incredible housekeeper to clean the common/shared spaces=
 and he comes about once a month. I will only ask you to contribute to th=
e the cost of the housekeeper if you are not into contributing to the cle=
aning of the house yourself and depending, we may have him come more ofte=
n, as needed. There is one very large shared bathroom with plenty of stor=
age space. Also, there are utilities and wifi costs of $65-85 for each of=
 us, per month, in addition to the rent.=20

I have installed a Murphy bed in your bedroom that allows for more flexib=
le use of the space and there is a closet but no other furniture in the r=
oom. You can install shelves if you like (I actually have some shelves th=
at can be installed but would prefer to allow you to make the choice), or=
 bring in storage units of your own.=20

Contact me if you are interested in finding out more about the apartment =
or neighborhood or me... I look forward to hearing from you.

$1,300.00 Per Month, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Room for rent in large 2 bed=
room Graham Ave. apartment
Available: Feb 01, 2015 through May 01, 2015

One 8x12 bedroom with a very big closet available in a large 2 bedroom ap=
artment available February 1st for $1300. The room faces the backyard and=
 gets great light. This is the second floor apartment of a two family hou=
se on an adorable street 2 blocks from the Graham L and 5 blocks from the=
 Metropolitan G. This is a great part of Williamsburg - quiet and neighbo=
rly but within reach of Bedford Ave, Bushwick, and Greenpoint. There&#39;=
s a large laundromat w/ wash &amp; fold service across the street, and a =
number of grocery stores in a 2 block radius. It&#39;s also close to Coop=
er park and all the great bars and shops on Metropolitan ave. and Grand s=
t.

The apartment has a large living room and dining room, one bathroom, plus=
 a huge attic with plenty of storage. The front of the house has gates wh=
ere you can lock up your bike. The furniture you see in the pictures will=
 be going away, so the apartment will be largely unfurnished. Utilities (=
internet and ConEd) come to about $50/month each.=20

You would be sharing with a 27 year old female web developer and cartooni=
st. I love the outdoors, going to shows, cooking, riding my bike. I&#39;m=
 very friendly, clean, considerate, keep pretty busy, and I&#39;m looking=
 for someone who&#39;s the same. I&#39;m a freelancer and always working =
on creative projects, so I would be open to repurposing one of the common=
 rooms into a shared workspace.

We&#39;re looking for someone to take over the lease until summer. The da=
tes are flexible, and you will likely have the option to re-sign and take=
 over the apartment. The landlord will want to meet you and preform a cre=
dit check beforehand, but there are no fees other than first month&#39;s =
rent and a 1 month security deposit.

Let me know if you&#39;re interested and we can arrange a time for you to=
 see the place!

$1,650.00 Per Month, East Village, New York, Large, sunny room - great ap=
t. Incredible convenience.
Available: Feb 01, 2015

I&#39;m looking for one roommate to fill a room in a 3 bedroom East Villa=
ge apt. This bedroom is on the corner of the building so its pretty large=
 (about 180 sq ft) and has a lot of windows. Plenty of space to fit a bed=
, a couch, and a desk. Hopefully, this is one of those apts that would sp=
oil future apts for you. Its kinda like having your own small studio, jus=
t sharing a pretty sweet kitchen and bathroom.

The apt is 2nd floor walkup. The eat-in kitchen is a great communal space=
, and the full bathroom is shared between all 3 roommates. The other 2 ro=
ommates are early 30s guys: an advertising copywriter (myself) and a tale=
nted app developer. We&#39;re both pretty busy and like to have a decent,=
 relaxing, quiet place when we aren&#39;t busy being busy.

Looking for a roommate that fits the usual bill: easy-going, clean, matur=
e, stable. But really hoping to find someone that fits the great vibe of =
this apartment: Similar creative interests. Interactive but respectful of=
 each others&#39; space. Catching up over a drink sounds like a great ide=
a but bringing the party home doesn&#39;t. Healthy outlook / approach to =
life. Both guys and gals are welcome as roommates.

There&#39;s more interesting food in the immediate surrounding 3 blocks t=
han you could possibly know what to do with. Lots of cool bars. Laundroma=
t is on the block. Transportation is all really easy.

Send an email about yourself if you&#39;re interested!

$850.00 Per Month, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, 600 sq. ft., Bright &amp=
; Warm Furnished (or not) Room for rent in two-bedroom apt., All utilitie=
s included!
Available: Feb 01, 2015

Available starting February 1st, available for minimum of 3 months (max. =
6, but negotiable) - so would be great for someone moving to NY or is in =
transition! Move-in will require first and last month&#39;s rent.=20

The neighborhood is growing, with farm/produce-share and a number of cafe=
s. The apartment is very close to G, J and the M train. The two bus-lines=
 are also very useful, B54 goes crosstown to Downtown Brooklyn passing Pr=
att and the B43 goes through Bushwick (L train&#39;s Grand St. stop area)=
 to Greenpoint. [When the weather is agreeable, I walk to Bushwick and W=
illamsburg without trouble!] There is a gated area in the back of the apa=
rtment for bikes, and has great bike roads to the city.

The rent is for a bedroom in a two bedroom apartment.=20
$ 850/month includes heat, electricity (a/c), water, gas, and internet. T=
here are plenty of windows to the apartment, which keeps it pleasantly br=
ight and well ventilated. I would ask for $15/month for bathroom and all =
cleaning supplies - but this is subject to further discussion (smiley fac=
e).

I like to keep the apartment a space for rest, and try to maintain peacef=
ul at home and reasonably tidy - with occasional dinner parties. I have a=
 non-shedding small dog that barely barks, and comes to work with me (tho=
ugh I work from home time-to-time).

++ I have an eclectic collection of books that I am more than happy to sh=
are if interested!

Feel free to contact me for more images of the space and/or to schedule a=
 viewing!

t Bedroom
Available: Feb 01, 2015

I will be moving cross country, leaving my two wonderful roommates and ge=
m of an apartment behind. Lucky for you!

The neighborhood we&#39;re in is considered the Columbia Waterfront Distr=
ict- right between where Carroll Gardens ends and Red Hook begins. It&#39=
;s a 10/15 minute walk to the F/G at Carroll and a block or two to the B6=
1. Decent street parking if you have a car, and a quick bike ride into th=
e city. There are parks and gardens galore, fireflies in the summer, the =
scent of the sea year round, great coffee, food, and live music all easil=
y within reach.

The apartment itself is a three bedroom railroad- meaning the bedrooms ar=
e all connected to one another. The room available however is the middle =
room- which is quite large, two windows that offer sunset views, decent s=
ized closet/storage, dark hardwood floors and tin ceilings. The apartment=
 has a good amount of common space, living and dining area, bathroom, kit=
chen, as well as an exterior roof top space we often use as a summer loun=
ge spot/space for our &quot;garden&quot;. We keep a pretty quiet home, an=
d have developed a weekly cleaning schedule- (though we are sometimes lax=
 about this).

Rent is $775 not including utilities- those usually run about 30-50 dolla=
rs depending on the season. Room will be available February 1st. Due to p=
rivacy this space is best suited for a female.=20

Will be showing the space all week/end. Let us know what you&#39;re up to=
 in NY, how you spend your free time, what you&#39;re excited about, etc!=
 Looking forward to hearing from you.

1&#39;2&quot; x 11&#39;1&quot;, and comes unfurnished.

This neighborhood is really great -- very safe, and in a beautiful locati=
on. The grounds of the complex are very well-maintained, and you will hav=
e access to a rooftop deck and a nice little back lawn in the warmer mont=
hs. The lobby of the building has a door that leads directly out the back=
 to the Battery Park City Esplanade. The complex also has a pretty nice f=
itness center and an outdoor pool, but you would have to pay an additiona=
l fee to management to use them.

About me: early 30s, female, working in the fashion industry, very laidba=
ck and friendly. Looking for a female roommate, 20s or 30s okay, preferab=
ly a working professional. Ideally, I would like to find a roommate who c=
an stay on until the end of my lease (July 31, 2015), and possibly longer=
 if I renew.

I would need a security deposit of $1635, electricity deposit of $150, an=
d the first month&#39;s rent $1635 for move-in. Please take a look at the=
 pictures and e-mail me if you have any questions, or if you would like t=
o set up a time to view the apartment. Thank you for your interest!

$950.00 Per Month, Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, Room available in charming 2BR=
 w/great location

I&#39;ve got a great 2 bedroom apartment in Clinton Hill proper, and I&#3=
9;m looking for a clean, courteous non-smoker roommate, ideally with a da=
y job because I work from home on weekdays. I also bartend 3-4 nights a w=
eek, so you&#39;ll have the place to yourself on most evenings!=20

The bedroom available is the perfect size for one person. I&#39;ve seen i=
t fit quite a bit: a full bed (a queen could work too), dresser, loveseat=
, bookshelf, desk, etc. If you&#39;re interested, there&#39;s a full bed =
available for your taking but otherwise, the room is unfurnished. It also=
 has a spacious closet.=20

The shared living room is furnished so ideally all that you would move in=
 with, excluding kitchen &amp; bathroom goods, would fit in your room. I =
have a storage closet, located off the living room, which you are welcome=
 to use for extra bulky items like an AC unit or bike, and there&#39;s a =
coat closet in the hall as well. Bathroom is your standard tub/shower/sin=
k/toilet deal. I&#39;ve got 2 sweet, well-behaved cats, but they mainly c=
hill in my room. Would prefer no additional pets though, sorry :(

The location is fantastic: 2 blocks from the C train at Clinton-Washingto=
n, 8 minute walk to Clinton-Washington G train, 10 minute walk to Atlanti=
c Center/Barclays/BAM, short stroll to Crown Heights, Fort Greene, Bed St=
uy and Prospect Heights. There&#39;s a grocery store around the corner, a=
 great bodega with fresh juice down the street, laundromat is steps away =
from the front door, tons of coffee shops and bakeries, plus Emily Pizza,=
 Fulton Grand, Sisters, and many excellent restaurants and bars close by.=


I&#39;m a 30 year-old writer who&#39;s lived in New York for 13 years. I&=
#39;ve had a handful of roommates and maintain friendships with them all =
still (though that has never been a requirement or expectation). Would lo=
ve to share the space with preferably another woman.

Rent is $950, which does not include utilities, + 1 month security upon m=
ove-in.

Thanks!

A little about me...
-27 yr old female
-I run my own small business=20
-I have been living in NYC/ Ft. Greene, Brooklyn for 9 years now, but am =

-I am in a relationship and my boyfriend is usually over the apartment a =
few nights a week, but he is very respectful and nice, so you will barely=
 even notice he is around.=20
-I love to travel the world, hang out with friends, cook, paint, and go t=
o concerts.
-I usually work a lot and because Im my own boss and a night owl, I tend =
to work a lot of odd hours. If you work a normal 9-5 job, there could ver=
y well be some weeks, where due to our schedules, I could not actually se=
e you for several days.
-Im a very easy going and tolerant person... easy to get along with. Real=
ly as long as you are a respectful roommate, common spaces are kept clean=
, dishes are done in a reasonable time, you can pay the rent, and your no=
t throwing big parties all the time, we would probably get along just fin=
e.

*Must be OK with dogs, as I have a small super friendly little dog who li=
ves in the apartment. He is trained to not go into the bedroom though, so=
 will never be in your space.

iamsburg location
Available: Feb 15, 2015

I&#39;m leaving NYC on February the 14th, so my roommate needs to find a =
delightful new compadre to share our apartment with. $1150 rent per month=
, $40 approx utilities each month, and $1150 security deposit. Move in wo=
uld be February 15th, and so rent would be pro-rated to $575 for the rema=
inder of February.=20

om the JMZ Marcy Stop, and around 10 min from the L train Bedford stop. T=
here are a lot of great cafes, bars, shops etc etc close by - everything =
you could possibly need all within walking distance.

The room you would move into is decent sized with a big window, so it get=
s a lot of natural light during the day. It can come furnished, as I am l=
eaving the city, so if you are relocating from somewhere else then this r=
oom could be a good fit for you. Items of furniture I have include: a bed=

able, and some plastic storage containers. You could pick and choose item=
s you might want (we can discuss this in further detail later though if y=

The roommate that you would be moving in with is an easy-going, 25-year-o=
ld toy designer who recently moved to the city herself from New Orleans. =
She&#39;s been awesome to live with, is very tidy and considerate, and ha=
s also been a great friend of mine to have in the city. She&#39;s looking=
 for a roommate who is relatively social and would be up for grabbing the=
 occasional drink together.=20

Please reach out if the above sounds like a good fit for you - we will be=
 showing the apartment for the next few weeks, so let us know if you&#39;=
re interested!

living space, large kitchen with dishwasher and all appliances. Private r=

seem like a lot but everyone is very busy and when home use the apartment=
 as a quiet place to relax. My bed is an authentic Japanese futon (full s=
ize) so if you like very soft beds this is not the place for you.. The be=
droom has a large window and large closet which I will take some of my th=
ings out to make room for yours.

The apartment and bedroom is fully furnished so all you will need to brin=
g is yourself and personal items. I can provide bed sheets if needed.

about you
Looking for someone who is respectful of the apartment and other roommate=
s. Everyone that lives here is really friendly, busy and clean so we are =
looking for the same in you. On rare occasions when we are home together =
we might cook together. If you intend to have an overnight guest please l=
et the other roommies know, and no more than a few days please.

$1,300.00 Per Month, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, 240 sq. ft., Large, bright, be=
autiful, artist room at The Greenpoint Palace!
Available: Feb 01, 2015 through Feb 28, 2015

I am going to be in LA for the month of February (flexible dates) and am =
looking for someone to sublet my room during this time. The rent is $1,30=
0 for the month including utilities. The room is large, bright, beautiful=
, furnished, works great as an art studio and/or office space with a desk=
 and comfortable chair, and there is plenty of open space to do yoga, dan=
ce, paint, etc.

We call the house The Greenpoint Palace. It&#39;s a big 3 story house in =
Greenpoint, Brooklyn with 5 rooms occupied by 4 other people in their 20&=
#39;s and 30&#39;s. It is a 5 minute walk from the Nassau G and a 15 minu=
te walk from the Bedford L. It takes around 20-30 minutes to get to Union=
 Sq and around the same to get uptown. You can transfer to the M or E at =
Court Sq. on the G that gets you uptown in 20-30 minutes. Greenpoint is a=
 great neighborhood close to parks, restaurants, bars, delis and more!

The entrance is on the first floor where there is a living room with a pr=
ojector, kitchen with a dishwasher, breakfast nook (complete with washer =
and dryer) and backyard. On the second floor are two rooms and a bathroom=
, and on the third floor are three rooms and a bathroom.=20
We who live here are all in the arts and have been living here since Marc=
h:
Me: I am a freelance filmmaker and live on the second floor (This is the =
room for sublet $1,300).
Maya: An experimental animator who also lives on the second floor.
Camila: An Argentinian spanish teacher who loves the arts. Especially poe=
try. 3rd floor.
Manuel: An experimental animator. 3rd floor.
Emily: A producer and actor who is currently going to graduate school for=
 film.

The house is a magical and creative place to live. Every once and a while=
 we organize art installations, poetry readings, jam sessions, dinner nig=
hts, etc. The house is huge so there are a lot of places to work from hom=
e and escape to. Even though there are a lot of us here, it doesn&#39;t f=
eel crowded since sound doesn&#39;t travel through the walls/floors and w=
e are all in and out throughout the day. We like to maintain a clean home=
 and have a general rule of picking up after ourselves, cleaning up when =
it&#39;s dirty, taking out the trash when it&#39;s full, sweeping and mop=
ping when the floor when it needed, etc.=20

We look forward to hearing from you!

The building is located in the 2nd stop of the L train (Lorimer station) =
and G train (Metropolitan Station) in Brooklyn -Williamsburg and it is a =
block from the subway. During rush hours we had trains running every five=
 minutes so you can easily be in Union Square in less that 10 minutes whe=
re you have transfer to most trains. The space is perfect for a working p=
erson who cares about their commute time. We would prefer someone who wor=
ks during the day out of the flat as we work a lot from home.

Sorry no pets...

I am attaching images of the space. Please contact me if interested. Let =
me know If you would like to set up an appointment to view the room.

$1,300.00 Per Month, Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, 150 sq. ft., Light Filled Ap=
artment in Modern Building - gym and doorman!
Available: Jan 26, 2015 through Apr 30, 2015

Hi!

I am leaving the country and moving to Haiti for work for the next three =
months, starting on January 26th and I would love to have you move into m=
y beautiful apartment!=20

I found this amazing spot on Listings Project in the fall and couldn&#39;=
t be happier here.=20

The room itself it quite large and furnished with a full-sized bed, dress=
er, desk, and bedside table. The bathroom is across the hall but will be =
exclusively yours as your lovely female roommate has her own private bath=
room en suite. The room faces east and gets amazing natural light, thanks=
 to the wall of windows!=20

Within the apartment itself is an immaculate kitchen, with stainless stee=
l appliances and a large island. The kitchen opens up into the living roo=
m. There is also a washer and dryer inside the apartment so you can feel =
free to do as much laundry as you desire - I have been basking in the lux=
ury of washing towels once a week.=20

The apartment building has a 24-hour doorman, two elevators, a fully-stoc=
ked gym, and a little patio/green area outside to be shared. I use the gy=
m about three times a week and rarely see anyone else while I&#39;m down =
there - at the most I&#39;ve shared it with two other ladies. Private gym=
!=20

You will be living with a wonderful girl and her amazing fat cat, Biggie.=
 My roommate graduated from Pratt a couple years ago and now is designing=
 her own pottery and furniture. This guarantees a perfectly decorated apa=
rtment! She prefers, as do I, that the sublet&#39;er is female and a nons=
moker. Sorry guys!=20

The rent is $1300/month - it&#39;s what I&#39;m paying now, I won&#39;t u=
p-charge you!

Thank you all! Please feel free to contact me with any questions or to ar=
range a time to stop bym. Have a great day!

The loft is located in one of the most vibrant and creative neighborhoods=
 in the world: Interesting chefs, craft coffee roasters, live music, film=
 screenings and galleries within a few blocks. but inside the apartment, =
it feels spacious and quiet. I am a painter and have used this space as a=
 live/work space for many years, so I keep it open and uncomplicated. Thi=
s loft space is also perfect for a couple because of the open layout, or =
for the individual who wants to feel spacious.

, as well as cookware. There is a standard bed, a sleeper couch and a que=
en sized air mattress if you have guests. There is a washer and dryer on =
the first floor of the building. The heat works well. street parking is p=
ossible. And you are welcome to use my bicycle. There is also an elevator=
.

 train at the Bedford Avenue stop. Also, close to the Marcy stop on the J=
Z train. and, if you bike or walk, you are close to the footbridge of the=
 Williamsburg Bridge which takes you right over into the Lower East Side =
of Manhattan

The place is great -- you wont be disappointed!

$1,100.00 Per Month, Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, 500 sq. ft., Huge Live/Work Spac=
e for Rent
Available: Jan 01, 2015

Hello! We are looking for a person or pair to fill an empty, giant baseme=
nt room in our beautiful apartment in Bed-Stuy, available immediately. Re=
nt is $1100/mo for an individual or $1200/mo for 2 people + utilities. Th=
e room is enormous and well-lit.  It would be easily divided and equally =
good for a pair or a huge live/work room. Please note: we unfortunately c=
an&#39;t accept any more pets and our apt is unfortunately not wheelchair=
 accessible.

You would be sharing the apartment with two people. J is a 31 year old qu=
eer, trans masculine white person.  J plays in 2 bands and works full-tim=
e, but is currently disabled. S is J&#39;s friendly and sweet pit-mix com=
panion. E is a 25 year old white, gay trans man. He is an artist and runs=
 a local print shop. P is E&#39;s low-key tabby cat. The animals get alon=
g well with each other and with other humans.

We have an intentional, accepting, and loving home environment. Queer-fri=
endly, trans-affirming, sex positive, anti-racist, feminist. We are looki=
ng for someone who shares these values: someone who is sensitive to other=
s, committed to open communication and has a cooperative, humorous attitu=
de. We are both very neat and organized, so a messy person would probably=
 not be the best fit. There is no indoor smoking, but you do have easy ac=
cess to an outdoor area.

Common Space (living room, kitchen, bathroom):
- Large, sunny, fully furnished living room with couch, comfy chairs, kit=
chen table w chairs, record player and television.
- Fully stocked kitchen with plenty of pantry space and your own cabinet =
and shelf in a spacious fridge, communal pantry basics, microwave, etc
- Nice bathroom with bathtub, nothing to write home about

Your Room:
The room is the basement of the apartment, and encompasses the size of th=
e entire first floor. It has 3 windows and is very sunny with a private d=
oor to an outdoor space. Your room has the apartment&#39;s washer+dryer, =
so we would need some negotiated access to the basement. The space is ide=
al for a sharing or division, a home studio or office, or any creative us=
e of a seriously gigantic space.

Apt Location:
- 2 blocks from the G Myrtle-Willoughby subway stop
- Nearby buses include: B44, B54, B38

$300.00 Per Week, Ridgewood, NY, Cozy Bedroom and Sunny Workspace
Available: Jan 19, 2015 through Jan 31, 2015

Hi Everyone,

Available for short term sublet is a cozy room and workspace.  I am a des=
igner/ stylist and will be out of town for the latter half of January.  T=
he space is actually two rooms without a door in between.  The bedroom is=
 approximately 9&#39; x 8&#39;, furnished with a full sized bed and dress=
er.  The closet is quite full with handmade clothing as this is my studio=
 and work space- but I can of course clear out some hanging space for you=
r clothing.  The studio space is about 10&#39; x 10&#39;.  The two window=
s let in lots of light.  There&#39;s a large standing height table that I=
 use for cutting fabric and pattern making, a desk, a size 6 dress/pant f=
orm, and an industrial sewing machine available for use. =20

I have a roommate that occupies the other half of the apartment.  She wor=
ks during the week from 9 - 5 so she is barely home during the days, and =
goes to bed pretty early.  We share the kitchen and bathroom, and both ke=
ep the space clean and tidy.  Our landlord and her family live downstairs=
.  They are very nice and friendly.  If you will be doing work in the lat=
ter hours, please be mindful of the noise.  The hardwood floors are beaut=
iful, but are quite creeky.  Please keep the noise level down especially =
after 10pm.

Aside from the weekends, you will usually have the apartment to yourself.=
  I have several plants in the studio.  The ideal subletter would keep an=
 eye on my plants and make sure they are watered :)  You are welcome to u=
se any sewing tools in the studio, providing that you take care and leave=
 anything you use as you originally find it.

I find Ridgewood to be an adorable neighborhood.  I lived in the Bushwick=
 area for about 8 years and finally made the move 2 years ago.  The chang=
e has definitely been creatively healthy!  If you&#39;ve been curious abo=
ut Ridgewood, this is a perfect space to get a feel for it.  There&#39;s =
a great cafe 2 blocks away from the apartment, several bodegas and a 24hr=
 grocery store nearby.  Laundromat, butcher, polish bakery, hardware stor=
es, and fabric store, post office, 24hr Rite Aid are also nearby, so I ra=
rely have to leave the neighborhood to find everyday necessities.    Not =
much bar or nightlife immediately nearby but the M or L train are pretty =
close.

The rent including utilities is 300/ week

Please write me if you have any questions.

Thank you for reading,
Anjia

$3,500.00 Per Month, chelsea, new york city, 430 sq. ft., Cozy (furnished=
) Chelsea Pad
Available: Feb 01, 2015 through May 19, 2015

My fab apartment in Chelsea is available until mid-May 2015 (or to be neg=
otiated), while I am traveling abroad. It&#39;s hosted number of guests w=
hile I&#39;ve been abroad, and they&#39;ve all loved it! (Note: rent incl=
udes electricity and wifi!)

The Space

It&#39;s a bit funky/bohemian, furnished mainly by &quot;film biz recycli=
ng (btw check it out, a definite stop on your visit in the City!) 1 BR ap=
artment with a balcony facing the peaceful brownstone inner courtyards - =
yet minutes from all the hustle and bustle.

The bedroom comes with a full/double bed and closet + other storage, the =
living room has a dining area (plus a loft that sleeps your guests if nee=
ded), fully equipped kitchen, bathroom w/shower (good pressure!), and you=
r own balcony on top of that.

The Neighborhood

This part of Chelsea, the gallery district, is as charming as West Villag=
e and as artsy as Williamsburg - the streets are lined with art galleries=
 and the art district is one of the most important and influential art di=
stricts in the world.

But it&#39;s not only art: we have the amazing restaurants on each block,=
 Hudson river park &amp; Chelsea Piers (both a block away), High Line in =
front of the building and everyone&#39;s favorite, Chelsea Market, a few =
blocks away. And you can walk literally anywhere, be it Union Square, SoH=
o or Times Square (well I&#39;ve even walked to Williamsburg but not in m=
y stilettos!). Or even better, rent bikes from the CitiBike stand right o=
n our block and take a ride to Central Park, South Street Seaport or to B=
rooklyn. And if not in the mood for exercise, crosstown bus stop is in fr=
ont of the house and metro (blue line, C/E) 2 blocks away.

I could go on and on and on. That is how much I like my hood. But drop me=
 a line and we&#39;ll take it from there.

Cheers &amp; welcome to the City!

ps. House Rules: smoking allowed on balcony - other than that just please=
 enjoy your stay!

Available: Jan 26, 2015 through Apr 30, 2015

A few days earlier, or later at the beginning, or end could be an option.=


Excellent heat, water, light, wifi, towels, sheets and
closed space. The heating pipes bang sometimes (a side effect of prewar b=
uildings).

Full kitchen to use. Water cooker, rice cooker, pots and pans, spices etc=
...

The neighborhood is full of great bars, restaurants, cafes, little shops =
etc... East Village...

Tompkins Square Park is 4 blocks away and there is a 24h market on the co=
rner.

The L train is 2 min away and brings you in one stop to Bedford Ave, the =
rest of Williamsburg and all parts of Brooklyn.

The 4, 5 and 6 that is 10 min away at Union Square brings you mostly anyw=
here else.

Pretty much any other line is a walk of approximately 15min.

A walk to the West Side or Lower east side takes about 20-30 min.

It&#39;s a 5th floor walk up.

How ever, there&#39; a roof, but another two floors up. Anyhow, it is ok =
with me to smoke the occasional cigarette in the apartment, just not in t=
he bedroom.

Please have a look at the photos and don&#39;t hesitate if you got any qu=
estions.

$1,500.00 Per Month, Park Slope, Brooklyn, 800 sq. ft., Clean, peaceful, =
large beautiful corner apartment for the right person
Available: Feb 01, 2015 through Jan 31, 2016

Hi there,
My husband and I spend most of our time in Vermont and come to Brooklyn a=
pproximately 1 week a month for work.  We have a beautiful 2-bedroom apar=
tment in Park Slope that we would like to rent to a clean and responsible=
 person (sorry, no couples or pets). =20

The situation is unique:  You would have the whole apartment to yourself =
for the majority of each month.  Since we are continuing to work in the c=
ity, we will be back for one week, on average, per month.  We are very qu=
iet, and when we&#39;re in town, we will be working.

The bedroom you would be staying in is the larger one.  It is on the corn=
er of the building and is quite spacious.  It has 3 big windows, new hard=
wood floors, full closet, good sunlight, etc.  The apartment has a large,=
 open living area and a charming kitchen with a bar-counter, full bath, n=
ice sunlight, etc.  We keep the space quite clean, and we are looking for=
 someone who would do the same while we&#39;re not here. =20

The apartment is on the 3rd floor.  The building is quiet.  We have held =
qigong classes and group meditations in the space in the past, and we wou=
ld love to maintain the tranquil feeling of the apartment.  We&#39;ve bee=
n in this apartment for a number of years and love it, so we are looking =
for someone who appreciates and cares for the space in the same way that =
we do.

We are an easy couple to live with.  Travis is a saxophonist, composer, a=
nd qigong practitioner.  Sarah is an acupuncturist (www.swordhands.com). =
 We enjoy reading, meditating, and working on our art/music. =20

The bedroom would be unfurnished, but we do have a dresser you can use.  =
The common area is furnished.  We prefer to keep the common area TV-free,=
 but if this is a deal-breaker, we can talk about it. =20

Utilities would be split.  References and a security deposit of 1 1/2 mon=
th&#39;s rent is required. =20

We are looking for someone for February 1st, ideally for 1 year, with the=
 possibility of extending. =20

The neighborhood is safe and has many great restaurants, bars, and cafes.=
  Prospect Park is a 10-minute walk from the apartment. =20

1 block from the R train, a 5-minute walk from the F &amp; G trains. =20

Feel free to contact us with questions.  We look forward to meeting you!
We are leaving Brooklyn early Saturday morning, so we are available to sh=
ow it starting today (Wednesday).  Although it&#39;s not much time, we ho=
pe to find the right person for the space by Thursday or Friday.

Happy New Year!

Best,
Sarah and Travis
