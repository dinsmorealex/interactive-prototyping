Slant 6 "Soda Pop*Rip Off" Available For Pre-Order

=20

Formed in 1992, Slant 6 was Christina Billotte, Myra Power, and Marge =
Marshall.

Prior to forming Slant 6, Billotte had played bass in Autoclave, who =
released a 7" single as a collaboration between Dischord and K Records =
and a post-humous 10" on Billotte's label, Mira Records (both were later =
compiled onto a single CD by Dischord). When that band split up in 1991 =
the other members moved out of town and Christina went to work on =
finding a new set of collaborators in DC.

While living at The Embassy =97 the Mount Pleasant group house that was =
also home to members of Nation of Ulysses =97 she met Myra Power, who =
had just moved to the area from Appalachia, and asked her to play bass =
while she moved over to guitar. The pair wrote a number of songs and =
performed their first show in the summer of 1992 with NOU bass player =
Steve Gamboa sitting in on drums. Power and Billotte would play with a =
few more drummers =97 including Rachel Carnes, of the New York City band =
Kicking Giant, and James Canty =97 before recruiting Marge Marshall to =
take the gig on a permanent basis.

In the fall of 1993, Slant 6 went to Inner Ear studios with Don Zeintara =
and Ian MacKaye to record what would become their debut full-length, =
Soda Pop*Rip Off. The trio toured extensively and released one more =
album, Inzombia, before splitting up while on tour in Europe in 1995. =
Billotte would go on to perform in Quix*o*tic and Casual Dots.

Out of print on vinyl for at least two decades, Soda Pop*Rip Off has =
been remastered by TJ Lipple. This pressing of the record has been done =
on red-colored vinyl and comes with a free digital download coupon for =
the 13 original album tracks plus the three songs from the What Kind of =
Monster Are You single.

Soda Pop*Rip Off is out October 14th and is available for pre-order now.

Orders are expected to ship on or near the October 14th release date. =
Any additional items ordered (including downloads) will be held and =
processed at the same time.

Tracklist: 1) Don't You Ever 2) Nights X 9 3) Love Shock 4) Double Edged =
Knife 5) Time Expired 6) Invisible Footsteps=20
