$800.00 Per Month, East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 2500 sq. ft., Shared Desi=
gn/Build - Machine Shop/Welding/Fabrication
Available: Jul 01, 2014

One final space is open at Kingsland Design &amp; Engineering Lab. Kingsl=
and D&amp;E is a shared design/build space catering to artist, designers =
and fabricators that need a space to develop and prototype their products=
. Our shop is split into a shared Design area and a Fabrication area. The=
 Design area offers your own built-in desk, WiFi, access to office and la=
rge format printers, Dimension 1200sst FDM 3D printer and electronics equ=
ipment. The Fabrication section offers access to table saws, chop/pull sa=
ws, sand blasting, MIG/TIG/Oxy welding and welding tables, laser engraver=
/cutter (acrylics), 3 Vertical Milling Centers (Johnford 500VMC, Milltron=
ics, and RoboDrill), Manual/CNC Bridgeport Hybrid and Manual Lathe. Holy =
Shit, right? Build whatever the hell you want, but we're mostly tailored =
towards metals and plastics rather than wood to keep dust down. Also, we =
stress &quot;prototyping&quot;. We have not the room for production-level=
 fabrication of large items. But, you can sure get to that point here. Th=
is is a great spot for those that divide time between computer-based desi=
gn and physical prototyping or want to get into computer-aided manufactur=
ing. Kinetic Sculpture, Robotics, Bicycle Frames, Product Design all seem=
 to work well in this environment.

The spot opening up is a built-in desk area in our shared office space th=
at includes a storage shelf and room on our material racks. Build it out =
to suit your needs. We are looking for single professionals to occupy bot=
h spots. No groups. We just don't have the floor space.

$1,000.00 Per Month, Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, NY, Large Rooms Near Pros=

Available: Aug 01, 2014 through Aug 01, 2015

I am looking for 2 roommates for August 1st. You may be able to move in e=
arlier, if necessary, though probably not before 7/15.
=20
The apartment is on the top floor of a two story house. There are 3 large=
 bedrooms. There is one tiny room that will be used by my cousin when he =
comes in town from Ireland. Each room is very big and could easily fit a =
bed, desk, dresser, etc. The apartment has a large kitchen, small dining =
area, and a &quot;sun room&quot; for the common areas.
=20
The neighborhood is very nice, quiet and safe. It is becoming more - dare=
 I say-  &quot;hip&quot; all the time. There are a few restaurants in wal=
king distance, as is a wine shop, a deli, and a new bar. It is Windsor Te=
rrace, Brooklyn, which is just south of Park Slope. You can walk to Park =
Slope in about 15 minutes. It is 1-2 blocks from the F/G line, B68 bus li=
ne, Prospect Park and 2 laundromats. The Q is about 15-20min walk across =
the park. Everything is very convenient. It takes me about 30 min to get =
to work at W. 23rd and 6th Ave.
=20
Each room is $1000/month. Additionally, we would split utilities 3 ways g=
as/electric/internet. I don't plan to get cable.
=20
I am looking ideally for roommates who want to stay a year, who are nice,=
 real,  healthy, happy, responsible, fun, employed, who don't smoke or do=
 drugs, who are friendly with active lives and friends outside the home b=
ut are also happy to have roommates who are also friends. This would not =
be a party house, though having a few friends over for a mellow something=
 is not a problem. Friends are welcome to come visit (preferably not long=
er than 10 days though), though no &quot;live in&quot; boyfriend/girlfrie=
nds - occasional sleep overs okay.  Will need to submit proof of income, =
landlord references, and for a credit check and sign a month to month lea=
se. First/Last for move in.

We can meet and chat about it now, but I won't be able to show you the pl=
ace until the beginning of July as it will be getting renovated and I am =
out of town until July 9th. However, if you...

w kitchen with granite countertops, oven/stove, refrigerator, sink and di=
shwasher, microwave, juicer, and a breakfast nook. The living room and ki=
tchen area are right near each other, and since there's a large bay windo=
w it gets lots of light all day. There are two full bathrooms: one includ=
es a standing shower and the other has a ceramic tub with a sunflower sho=
wer head, so at the end of the day no one has to smell like kielbasa and =
hot trash, which we all know nyc does.

There is a laundromat across the street as well as a tasty ice cream plac=
e. There are multiple restaurants/cafes, grocery stores, liquor stores, p=
harmacies, and deli's nearby. The closest train is the G at Bedford-Nostr=
and and there are a few bus lines that run around here also (B38, B54, B4=
4, B52) only a few blocks away. ten minutes to Williamsburg, 15 mins to b=
ushwick, ten minutes to downtown bk, 25-30 mins to the city. access to th=
e A/C, L, 7, E, and M trains by taking the G and transferring.=20

Rent is $850/mo including utilities. The room is a 7ftx9ft, so a twin mat=
tress would fit comfortably with a dresser and chair (you could fit a que=
en size mattress too, for a more cozy feeling), it has hardwood floors an=
d no windows. There is a large double doored 5.5ft x 2ft lit closet right=
 across from the room for your use.=20

The roommates: We are three ladies and art/design students in their early=
 twenties. We work, have internships, and like cheese. We like to keep an=
 easy going household where funky music is played and soup is made. Where=
 the cacti look nice and nobody has lice (seriously). Each of us are usua=
lly out and about doing our own thing but enjoy hanging out together too.=

$1,200.00 Per Month, Bushwick, Brooklyn, 2BRs available in brand-new buil=
ding
Available: Aug 01, 2014 through Jul 31, 2015

# Location: Bushwick (2-blocks off the L  Jefferson Stop)
# 2BRs available in a 3BR apartment

The apartment building was finished in August 2013 as one of Bushwick's n=
ewest rentals. The management company, All Year Management, decided to ke=
ep the rent where it was. I am one of the original tenants and I'm lookin=
g to find two new roommates to take on the 2014  2015 lease with me.

This is a 3 bedroom apartment on the top floor (fourth) of a brand-new wa=
lk-up. The unit has: a virtual (English-accent) doorwoman; matte wooden f=
loors; wall-mounted air conditioning units; granite counter tops with a s=
tainless steel high-end stove/oven and fridge; simple and clean bathroom =
with minimal finishing; a washer/dryer (that's actually in the unit); and=
 a kick-ass balcony. The rooftop is also open to the entire building and =
pretty sweet for shindigs.

I'm Kristopher, a 24 year-old creative/techie working for a virtual start=
-up. I've been with the company for two years and currently working as a =
strategist-in-training. On the side I take on freelance design gigs for G=
oogle events. When I'm not working, I'm usually geeking out or chilling w=
ith friends (like every other twenty-something, right?). I'm a laid-back,=
 no bullshit guy that fancies men. I have had my puggle, Elle, for six ye=
ars now and she's here to stay.

There are 2 bedrooms available for rent at $1200 each.=20

# Absolutes
- Must be dog-friendly, I have a six-year old Puggle that loves affection=
 and means well
- Must be lgbt-friendly, feels a little silly to list it but let's just a=
void potential awkward situations

# What I'm looking for
- Financially-responsible people, don't need to have your shit together (=
though it helps), just gotta' make rent
- Clean in the sense that you do your own dishes and pick up after yourse=
lf in the common areas
- Low-strung/-maintenance folks that aren't afraid of confrontation (let'=
s just be &quot;adults&quot; and solve conflicts before they explode, yah=
?)
- Preference towards creative types but...

in the heart of the UWS available for 1 year lease
Available: Aug 01, 2014 through Jul 31, 2015

Looking for a roommate to cosign a yearlong lease with me on my charming =
UWS apartment beginning August 1st.=20

$1300 for a sizable bedroom (currently has a full bed, dresser, long book=
shelf, 2 side tables and an armchair) with a large closet. The bedroom do=
es NOT have windows, but there is one directly outside the door. Perfect =
for someone who likes a quiet place to sleep. My current roommate is look=
ing to sell/leave most of the furniture, so the room could come completel=
y furnished.=20

The apartment is a 4th floor walkup near 80th and Amsterdam, with a dishw=
asher, full bathroom, wifi, large TV with Netflix, a wii and amazon insta=
nt video, and a great roommate (and great landlord too)! No pets permitte=
d, unfortunately. Utilities average around $50-$60/month.=20

The neighborhood is wonderful- drugstore, liquor store, laundromat, and t=
ons of restaurants and bars are all within a one block radius, and the ap=
artment is right above a wine bar, restaurant and frozen yogurt shop. The=
 1 train is one block away and takes you into midtown in less than 10 min=
utes. B/C trains also nearby.=20

I'm a female in my late 20s who works in marketing, so I'm usually out of=

$1,300.00 Per Month, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 1400 sq. ft., Semi-furnished=
 bedroom in huge loft off Bedford L Available: Today through ???
Available: Jul 01, 2014

Looking for a long-term (at least 3 month) roommate to live in a furnishe=
d 1400 square foot, four bedroom open loft off the Bedford Avenue L train=
 starting July.   The bedroom is available immediately, so please contact=
 us right away to meet us and visit the apartment.  (I realize the 1st of=
 the month has passed, so I'm willing to negotiate a pro-rated July, depe=
nding on the move-in date.)  The room has a full mattress and bedframe, d=
esk with lamp, chair, open dresser with hanging rack section, and shelvin=
g. The loft has a big open kitchen with skylight and a large common area =
with wall to wall windows and plenty of room for our bikes.  It's located=
 in the thick of Williamsburg only 4 blocks away from the L train (10 min=
utes to Union Square) and easy walking/biking distance to all the great r=
estaurants, bars, and shops the neighborhood has to offer. Having lived h=
ere for the past 8 years, I can attest to the amazing location and conven=
ience of living in the neighborhood at this specific apartment.

We are hardworking, clean, friendly and motivated in our early 20s and 30=
s: a male cinematographer and camera assistant and for tv, films, and com=
mercials (http://kylerepka.com/), a female working in fabric research and=
 development for Tory Burch, and a female working in corporate customer s=
ervice for MZ Wallace. We keep a quiet, tidy, and respectful atmosphere a=
bout the apartment, so if you're loud, unkempt, and a jerk, please don't =
respond to this post! Being very busy with our work responsibilities and =
various activities (going to art galleries/museums, traveling, going to c=
oncerts, cooking, exercising, etc.), it's a rarity to all be at the apart=
ment at the same time, but if so we're happy to see each other and catch =
up or cook dinner. We're definitely not crazy party people, but we do occ=
asionally enjoy crazy parties, just not at our place.

If you think this seems like a good fit please respond to the post as soo=
n as possible.  Ideally, you're a considerate and...

$1,400.00 Per Month, Chinatown/LES, New York, 1000 sq. ft., Unusually Lar=
ge 3BD LES/Chinatown
Available: Jun 10, 2014 through Jul 31, 2014

This apt is a haven and an unusually spacious &amp; vintage style (sporti=
ng the Grandma vibe right now) 3 bedroom. Its easy walking distance to th=
e Lower East Side, downtown, Seaport, SoHo, Nolita and Village; and offer=
s a quiet repose after experiencing the hectic city.

The Space
Beautiful, spacious, proper 3 BD in Chinatown with a living room, dining =
area and separate kitchen. 12x10 BD, with 1 big window. We are easy going=
, 1 guy, 27, works &quot;for the internet.&quot; He is a movie going, cur=
ious intellectual. And I, Martha, 40, am a former choreographer turned fi=
lmmaker and currently producing some stuff. I also run a story-telling se=
ries. I know NY inside and out and will help you get around. The apartmen=
t is very clean and extra large. People have called it the palace, the tr=
ee-house, a birds nest.=20

The bathroom has a stand up shower and is literally up 2 stairs; it's a t=
rue throne. The galley kitchen is small but it also extends out into the =
dining area. We are also on the 5th floor (walk up), which means it's exc=
eptionally quiet and you get a NY work out in the meantime.

The Neighborhood
&quot;The Haven&quot; borders the Lower East Side and Chinatown (one of m=
y favorite neighborhoods). You can enjoy a dumpling house, buy fish, frog=
s or lychees at the market, or get a foot or back rub right outside your =
door. Or you can head to Katz's deli, go to the Doughnut Plant or enjoy t=
he hottest bars in the city. Either way, &quot;the haven&quot; is well si=
tuated so you can get the bustle without the craziness.

No pets. No couples. No smoking. =20

Shorter term situations possible - different pricing.=20

About us
------------
The dog is a ten-year old mix-breed dog, likely some kind of staffordshir=
e terrier pit mix, maybe with some basenji or boxer. She's small (much sm=
aller than a pit) and likes to cuddle, roll around on the floor and chew =
on stuffed animal toys.

I'm a musician in my mid-thirties. I belong to the dog. I'm into yoga. I'=
m a practicing Buddhist, which means I burn a lot of incense and chant in=
 front of the shrine in my bedroom every morning and evening. I'm mostly =
vegetarian and I never cook meat in the house. I work a 9 to 5 job in the=
 office of a fine arts shipping company in Queens. I play guitar and sing=
 in my bedroom. I listen to a bunch of NPR.

The other guy in the apartment is an engineer in his mid-twenties. He wor=
ks in a 3D printing lab. He is very into cooking, bicycle maintenance, ho=
me brewing, various small building and construction hobbies,...

$675.00 Per Month, Flatbush/Prospect Lefferts Gardens, Brooklyn, 100 sq. =
ft., Bedroom available in 5BR apartment, two blocks south of Prospect Par=
k on Q/B train
Available: Jul 01, 2014 through Aug 31, 2014

I am looking for someone to sublet a room in my apartment for July and Au=
gust until my brother returns. The dates are somewhat flexible, but two m=
onths is my ideal.

The apartment is a 5BR in Flatbush, Brooklyn. The apartment is two blocks=
 south of Prospect Park and the Q train's Parkside Ave stop; a five minut=
es walk from the Church Ave B train; and a 25 minutess commute to Union S=
quare. Within two blocks are two good grocery stores, a fruit market, an =
Indian restaurant, two dollar stores, a laundromat, a McDonalds, a Subway=
, etc.

The apartment is on the second floor of a four-story building and faces a=
way from the street. It is very quiet. The room has high ceilings and is =
semi-furnished with a bed, desk and stool. It currently has a full-sized =
bed, but I could swap it for a twin if you'd prefer more floorspace. $675=
 + utilities / mo.

We don't have a living room or &quot;common area,&quot; so this is not a =
great apartment for entertaining crowds or throwing dinner parties. There=
 is no dishwasher, so please know how to wash dishes and be committed to =
keeping them clean!

Roommates are all mid-to-late twenties males and one female, busily emplo=
yed, and often out, so the apartment doesn't feel crowded.

Please write introducing yourself if you'd like to stop by and check the =
place out. No pets and no smokers, please.

Thanks!

Hi, =20
Great space and location. Safe, cozy and bright.=20
I am an Irish teacher and I am subletting my two rooms while I go home to=
 Ireland for a holiday. One fits the bed and one is pretty large withe tw=
o windows and a couch.  You would share apt with one F roommate and share=
 kitchen, bathroom and sitting room. I can only rent to one person, sorry=
.

You must love cats, I have two cute ones- that will want to be cuddled. Y=
ou do not have responsibilities but I only want cat lovers. This is why I=
 am giving a deal- I want someone I can trust with my kitties and my stuf=
f.
It is perfect if you are studying and you want a quiet retreat. Not for p=
arties etc. My roommate is finishing up her masters in art dealership.
Near the indoor pool and outdoor pool in the park. 5 mins to the bridge f=
or walking or riding to Lower East Side. It is a great deal for the right=
 person:)
My dates are rough- about to get tickets - can be flexible. I leave about=
 July 15th and back about August 28th. Wifi included.
I look forward to hearing from you. I am in and out of town and will get =

$1,200.00 Per Month, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, 800 sq. ft., Lovely 2 Bedroom =
in Greenpoint
Available: Jul 15, 2014 through Sept 15, 2014

I am looking for a short term roommate to share my apartment during a few=
 months where I will be traveling almost continually, so you would have t=
he whole place to yourself for all but a few days. I am open to a longer =
sublet, too, and am flexible on start and end dates, depending on the per=
son and situation.=20

The place: I have lived here for 8 years, and I love it: a big 2 bedroom =
floor through on one of Greenpoint's landmark streets. Kitchen, dining ro=
om, TV room, two bedrooms and a bathroom. One bedroom overlooks a beautif=
ul, old church (not currently used for religious purposes) and the other =
the leafy backyards at the interior of the block. The building has a lot =
of old time charm, and that's my taste, too; rooms are full of books and =
art. Furniture is mostly vintage, beds all new. I have lived here with bo=
yfriends and roommates, and the bedrooms are far apart, giving plenty of =
privacy even when two or three people are at home. Although there is lots=
 of closet space, the apartment is fully furnished, so I am seeking someo=
ne without tremendous amounts of stuff. There is TV with cable, borrowed =
but totally functional internet, and a lot of comfortable sitting, readin=
g, music-listening spots.=20

Me: I am a fiction writer, female, in my mid-30s. I grew up in California=
 but have lived in New York for the last fifteen years. Although I am not=
 entirely clean living, I like my home to be a quiet refuge from city lif=
e. The landlady lives below, which is another reason that I'm looking for=
 a mature person who wants to come home to a nice, tranquil spot.=20

The neighborhood: Greenpoint is the nicest place I've ever lived in the c=
ity-- it's near the East River, the locals are laid back, creative and ne=
at-looking, tons of cute shops and bars, and a lot of the new restaurants=
 and cocktail joints are ambitious and awesome. My place is a block from =
the train, and it's a long but pleasant walk to the L train and all the W=
illiamsburg stuff. =20

No pets
No smoking
No couples...

er landlord. No fees.

This studio is really large for New york.  It has five windows, so its al=

The decor is colorful, which makes me feel so happy when the weather is d=
reary.  18th street is pretty quiet as far as New York goes, but I'm only=
 a 5 minute walk from Union square which means life is very convenient.  =
There is laundry in the basement and a part time doorman who is very help=
ful.  I can't say enough about the neighborhood--Irving place is a gem an=
d I'm so sad that I have to leave it for a while.  Whoever rents this pla=
ce will need to put down a month's rent for security. I am looking for at=
 least a four month rental, up to 6.  No smoking or pets are allowed in t=
he apartment.  There are three large closets and plenty of space in the k=
itchen to cook.  This apartment really has everything one could need, inc=
luding an elevator!

$825.00 Per Week, Little Italy/Soho, New York, NY, 410 sq. ft., Entire lo=
vely, sunny 1-BR short sublet for visiting nice person!
Available: Jul 26, 2014 through Aug 17, 2014

Hello nice people of Listings Project,=20

My nice, sunny, real one-bedroom apartment is available during the listed=
 time frame - I would really like the term to start July 26th/27th and la=
st for at least 2 weeks, perhaps three. I'm flexible somewhat so email me=
 and we can work it out. (Preference is for a single person - I might eve=
n give a discount for you! :)

About the apartment...  It's a real one-bedroom with loads of light. Ther=
e are five very large windows and even a little tiny one in the bathroom.=
 It's in one of the best locations in the city. Located at the intersecti=
on of Little Italy, Soho, Nolita, and Chinatown, it's super close to TriB=
eCa and the East Village and Lower East Side are 15-minutes walking. The =
neighborhood is filled with excellent restaurants, bars, shops and boutiq=
ues, and there are several subways and a parking lot all very close.

The bed is a queen-sized dream and the comfy little sofa to great for rel=
axing, reading or taking a snooze. I have a housekeeper come before to ma=
ke sure everything is clean.

I'm looking for someone mature, quiet and responsible and very discreet. =
This is NOT a social or party situation. (This is really important.) It's=
 a NYC-style, typical pre-war building apartment, so it's best for a solo=
 person, ok for a couple, not ok for a family.

Also very important is that there are two super cute, sweet cats who live=
 here. So this arrangement is for someone who wants/would like/is ok with=
 cat friends. They are friendly (no bad behavior) and are a breeze to tak=
e care of.

Please feel free to contact me for more information or questions. Thank y=
ou!

Available: Jul 15, 2014

We are a couple, (32 and 26 y/o, respectively,) professionals and artists=
, looking for a new long-term place starting mid-July/August 1. We are no=
n-smokers, low-key and respectful, and have lived in the same apartment i=
n Astoria for three years now, with excellent references from our current=
 Super. Mainly, we would love a place with some outdoor access! (A balcon=
y or yard is preferable, but rooftop access could suffice, if the situati=
on is right.)

We are flexible about neighborhoods, but would prefer Queens or Brooklyn.=
 Most importantly, we need something close to a reliable subway line with=
 easy access to Manhattan, where we both work. We'd prefer a 2BR, but a l=
arger 1BR with an office or small additional room that could be used as a=
n office and storage could work.

We currently pay just under $1900 and don't really want to go much higher=
 than that. Thank you for your time!!!=20

$700.00 Per Month, Clinton Hill/Fort Greene, Brooklyn, Looking to rent a =
room from Aug/Sept. 1st - June 2015
Available: Aug 01, 2014

Hi,=20

I currently live in Astoria and am looking to move to Brooklyn, preferabl=
y the Fort Greene/Clinton Hill neighborhoods. These locations would mean =
a much better commute to W4th Street St and I also really like the area.

I will be studying painting and sculpture in the city from Sept-June.

I would love a clean, pleasant apartment and to share with one other pers=
on would be great.

Rent and utility payments wont be an issue- my current roommate of two ye=
ars has offered to provide a reference about this.

Ideally the apartment would be a low-key place. I am certainly respectful=
 of others' space and privacy. It would be cool if we shared similar inte=
rests..art, music, literature..i like to use my moma membership to see as=
 much free good movies as I can ;).. I go see shows in Chelsea and LES..g=
igs too..fan of free stuff, basically I keep quietly busy..love to read a=
nd write.

Would enjoy having a cup of tea and a chat with whoever I live with..have=
 lived with people of all ages so age is not an issue for me..neither is =
gender.

dog- friendly.

If you have a room to rent, are a friendly, reasonable and considerate (e=
ven skeptical!) person, I would be happy to hear from you and talk more,=20=


thanks for reading,=20

all the best,=20

I've found myself on this search a bit unexpectedly but such is life one =
door closes and another opens-- my new home will be even more amazing tha=
n the one I have now, I'm sure.

I work as a freelance creative, I can do just about anything with regards=
 to aesthetic and design. This also means if your space needs a little fi=
xing up, I would be more than happy to give it some love-- I'm really gre=
at at these sorts of things.=20

As a tenant I am very quiet and respectful of my space, neighbors, and co=
mmunity. I always pay my bills on time and truly make my space my home an=
d sanctuary. I don't smoke or have any pets, though I do love animals. My=
 present landlord would be more than happy to give me a great reference.

My budget isn't very big and I know I'm looking for quite the needle or g=
em if you will in a haystack, I love my neighborhood so much and truly ha=
ve made it my home over the years. Fortunately I also have a lot time and=
 flexibility with my move-in date, can be now or in the upcoming months, =
finding the perfect space is most important to me.=20

I am looking for an unfurnished pre-war space for long term lease.=20

I am open to two room studios but I really think I need a true one bedroo=
m, I'm aware this will be a difficult find.=20

 the past.

I am not looking for a share situation but a place of my own.=20

Please do not contact me about apartments in neighborhoods that are not F=
