Label News

Well, this is a big update for a change! First up we have 2 brand new
releases on Sorry State, both demos from North Carolina bands. In
fact, we have new demos from all three contributors to this newsletter
this month, but it looks like we're currently out of Seth's band,
Black Zinfandel, so someone bug him to bring us more!

Anyway, first up is the debut tape from Jeff's new band Skem=C3=A4ta.
Here's the description:

After the demise of Stripmines in the summer of 2012, Jeff Young
(guitar) and Alex Taylor (bass) kept writing songs, looking for the
perfect lineup to keep pushing forward their unique brand of raw,
fast, and technical hardcore. Eventually recruiting Cameron Craig
(Logic Problem, Double Negative, Davidians) on drums and Usman on
vocals, Skem=C3=A4ta started playing shows in late 2013 and were
immediately a force to be reckoned with. Fans of Stripmines will
certainly love them, but Skem=C3=A4ta incorporates a bunch of new
influences as well, like the subtle melodic qualities of Sickoids and
the rawer, more direct hardcore of bands like Framtid and Bastard.
Watch for a debut LP from these guys on Sorry State later this summer.
This release is limited to 150 copies with 2-sided, screen printed
j-cards, pro-duplicated tapes and download code.

Secondly, we have a pretty killer tape from a project I did this past
summer called Narcoman... here's the info on that:

When Raleigh=E2=80=99s Cross Laws broke up in 2007, Matt and Daniel went =
on
to form Devour, but Dennis (bass and vocals) took an entirely
different path, serving two years as part of the Peace Corps in
Turkmenistan and then returning to North Carolina to be a high school
teacher in Asheville. While he wasn=E2=80=99t actively playing in any =
bands,
Dennis had his guitar with him through this entire period, crafting
and refining a huge backlog of songs. In the summer of 2013 Dennis got
together with fellow Cross Laws alumnus Daniel as well as Cameron
Craig (Logic Problem, Double Negative, Skem=C3=A4ta) on drums to make raw
4-track recordings of 4 of these songs. The results are quite a bit
different from Cross Laws=E2=80=A6 more complex, refined, melodic, and
subtle, Narcoman recalls the best of ambitious, catchy 80s hardcore
like Articles of Faith, early Husker Du, and Upright Citizens. This
release is limited to 150 copies with a screen-printed j-card,
pro-duplicated tapes and download code.

As I noted in the descriptions, both of these demos feature pretty
darn handsome packaging including screen printed j-cards by me and
pro-duplicated cassettes. And as per usual they're both up on the
Sorry State BandCamp site ( http://sorrystaterecords.bandcamp.com/ )
if you want to check them out before ordering.

Things are starting to move on a couple of other upcoming releases,
but nothing's ready to be announced just yet... maybe next month?

There's also a LOT going on this month in terms of shows. I'm beyond
psyched to say, for the first time in a long time, that I'll be
catching a few Brain F=E2=89=A0 gigs this weekend. First up is this Friday
at the Milestone in Charlotte (Facebook event here (
https://www.facebook.com/events/617567058297108/ )), and then they're
also playing Phuzz Phest in Winston-Salem on Saturday. Catch me up
front losing my shit at both gigs.

Whatever Brains are also playing a whole bunch of shows this month,
including an appearance at Phuzz Phest playing before Kool Keith(!!!).
Whatever Brains are currently brandishing a brand new bassist, but he
wasn't available to go on the Protomartyr tour, so Anthony from
Winston-Salem acts like Burglar Fucker and Primo Van Halen will be
filling in. I hear that the NC shows will actually feature both
bassists, which should make for an interesting experience. Oh, and
most of these dates are with Protomartyr, whose new LP absolutely
rules... I'll have that in the distro this coming month. Here's the
full slate of dates:

4/3 - raleigh @ slim's w/ PC WORSHIP, WINSTON FACIALS
4/6 - winston-salem @ ziggy's w/ KOOL KEITH, MISS EAVES, TOON AND THE
REAL LAWW
4/17 - raleigh @ slim's again w/ PROTOMARTYR, SPRAY PAINT
4/18 - atlanta @ 529 w/ PROTOFARTR, SPRAY PAINT
4/19 - tallahassee @ liberty bar w/ PROTOSHARTR
4/20 - blazin doobies w/ PROTOLARPR
4/21 - new orleans @ circle bar w/ PROTOPARTYR
4/22 - birmingham @ bottle tree w/ PROTOBARTYNDYR, DEISM
4/23 - nashville @ stone fox w/ PROTOTHECARTERIII, CHEAP TIME
4/24 - cincinnati @ motr pub w/ PROTOOLSMARTYR
4/25 - cleveland @ now that's class w/ PRILOSECOTC

I'm also booking a couple of gigs in town this month that promise to
be scorchers... first up is Good Throb and Priests with No Love (Seth
and I's band):

Facebook event ( https://www.facebook.com/events/570523429722555/ )

And then the night after the Violent Reaction / Flex tour is stopping
in Raleigh:

Facebook event ( https://www.facebook.com/events/740296246001787/ )

This show will be the debut for a new band called Prosthesis, which
Jeff and I both play in. This band is composed of Jeff and Ira from
Stripmines and me and Dave from Devour, along with David from Vacant
Planet on guitar. If you were a fan of Devour, you should be stoked
about this band as it kind of picks up where we left off... total
uncomfortable hardcore/metal vibes a la early Neurosis or something
like that... hopefully we can also record sometime this spring.

As if that weren't a big enough to-do list for this month, there's
also Damaged City Fest weekend after next, where I'll be hopefully
dragging a table full of distro records and Jeff's band Mercy Killings
will also be playing. I really wish I could make it to New York's
Alright as well (DiE... ugh! I hate to miss them so much!), but that
falls on Record Store Day weekend so I will sadly be absent.

Alright folks, I think that's enough for one month!

Jeff's Update

Hey Sorry Staters!!

Been at the store a little less lately because I=E2=80=99ve been outta =
town
a bunch on my normal workdays.  Still, there=E2=80=99s been some killer =
new
releases in the last few weeks.  First of all, if you like good
hardcore, you NEED that Oblivionation 7=E2=80=9D.  So killer. I=E2=80=99ll =
just
leave you with that for this month.

On a personal note, the Skem=C3=A4ta demo tape is out, and I=E2=80=99m so
stoked.  I=E2=80=99m also happy to say that in a few weeks we=E2=80=99ll =
be going
to record our LP for Sorry State.  New songs, and a thicker sound.
That should hopefully be out late summer time.  Also, we=E2=80=99ll be
playing some out of town dates in May, so be on the lookout for us
when we come your way!

Also, I wanted to use this as a vehicle to express thanks to everyone
who showed Mercy Killings a good time this past weekend.  We=E2=80=99ll be
playing Damaged City in a couple weeks, and then we=E2=80=99re also going =
to
record for a new record at the end of April.

Thanks for reading.  See you all next month!

-Jeff

Seth's Update

This month has been a good month for females in music; the Tozcos
tape is killer, I really dug the new Coathangers LP... it's the
perfect amount of dirt and dream.  Also I really likes the Julie Ruin
LP; it's a good balance of Le Tigre and Bikini Kill. The artwork for
the Perfect Pussy album threw me off but it's fantastic, super punk
with lots going on to make it interesting and stand out. My other pick
is Ukiah Drag... great dirty garage punk.

Till next month,
Seth

Daniel's Update

Man, I feel like I have a lot to talk about this month! First of all,
we got in some great new releases... you can't go wrong in a month
when you have a new Lumpy & the Dumpers single, and the other hyped
new releases from Warthog, Oblivionation, and Peacebreakers all
deliver as well. I was also stoked to get copies of the Blazing Eye
and Tozcos demos... great raw hardcore from both bands. The new
Casanovas in Heat single has also spent a lot of time on the store's
turntable, and they were great live as well... honestly, though, the
record that is really blowing my mind this month is the reissue of the
Avon Calling compilation LP. It really doesn't get any better than
this as far as regional comps go... the lineup is incredible diverse,
but every band delivers top-notch work.

I should also mention that thanks to an incredibly busy month I've had
trouble keeping up with adding new releases and restocks to this
newsletter... just off the top of my head I can see I didn't mention
the sick new Anti-Dogmatikks reissue below, and there's a lot of other
stuff on the site not mentioned here either. Have a browse if you have
some free time!

Also, we just had a big batch of stuff come in today including the two
new Toxic State cassettes from Black Boot and Deformity, restocks of a
bunch of in print Toxic State stuff, the new Predator LP, and a bunch
of other things. Those are on the site already so you can feel free to
order, but descriptions and such will be on the next update. Oh, and
we're still shipping most orders within 24 hours, so you'll get your
stuff quickly!

Finally, our 7" bins have gotten really full, so I added around 300
used 7"s to the web site. There's not a lot of the rare hardcore
that's the shop's specialty (there are a few things though!), but
there are some interesting odds and ends... most used things added to
the site won't show up at the front of the New Arrivals section, so
you may want to browse through the used section of the site (
http://www.sorrystaterecords.com/collections/used-records ) every now
and again... hopefully we'll be able to add some used LPs soon as well
as there are a couple of scorchers that have been sitting in the shop
for way too long.

Oh, and if you ever want to sell or trade your used records to Sorry
State we're happy to do this through the mail! If you don't have a
solid used record store in your area, don't feel like mailing out
dozens of individual orders necessary to do an online set sale or
discogs / ebay, we can buy small or large collections through the mail
and either pay you with trade credit for the webstore, cash in your
paypal account, or a check through the mail. If anyone out there is
interested please get in touch as we're always on the hunt for used
punk records!

Narcoman: demo cassette (Sorry State)
When Raleigh=E2=80=99s Cross Laws broke up in 2007, Matt and Daniel went =
on
to form Devour, but Dennis (bass and vocals) took an entirely
different path, serving two years as part of the Peace Corps in

release is limited to 150 copies with a screen-printed j-card,
pro-duplicate tapes and download code.

Ukiah Drag: Dirt Trip 7" (Wharf Cat)
Debut 7" from this band features some members of some Florida bands
you might have heard of, but Ukiah Drag actually resides in New
England. The a-side here is a dense, lurching post-punk song... it's
very song-oriented, unlike a lot of post-punk stuff I've been hearing
lately, and actually reminds me a bit of some of the stuff on
Olympia's Perennial Records. As for the b-side, it's a little
different, with a kind of fall-inspired rockabilly lurch... it
actually reminds me a bit of Whatever Brains (except the vocals), so I
guess by extension it can also fit in with that whole Protomartyr / PC
Worship / etc. scene... a killer single with sick artwork to boot.

Various: Avon Calling 12" (Radiation)
Reissue of this absolutely STELLAR regional comp from 70s Bristol,
England. The only two bands I was familiar with going in were Glaxo
Babies and Vice Squad, but all of the unknowns collected here are
really blowing my mind. As with the best regional comps, there's a
diversity in styles, ranging from song-oriented UKDIY to straight punk
to some tracks that almost border on a NWOBHM-type sound. Actually, I
think Vice Squad have probably the weakest track here, and it's not
even weak... it's a solid Vice Squad song. If you're generally
interested in what was happening in the late 70s UK underground, this
is a must-hear... highest possible recommendation!

SFN / In Disgust: Split 7" (Drugged Conscience)
Apparently this split was originally conceived as a 5", but after
some serious production delays it now sees light of day as a split
1-sided 7". Both bands play super fast power violence / grind, but
this is totally legit... it's no weak teeny-bopper power violence. The
rawness and the intricacy of changes reminds me quite a bit of the
original Crossed Out / No Comment / Man Is the Bastard / etc. axis...
this contains some really inventive riffing and perfect raw production
that makes this sound go down right.

Dads: Invisible Blouse 7" (Wharf Cat)
New pressing of this single from the same Tampa scene that birthed
bands like Cult Ritual, Merchandise, Neon Blud, etc. Of those bands,
Merchandise is probably the best reference point, as Dads seem
similarly inspired by the long tradition of British guitar pop that is
at least vaguely Smiths-inspired, and they also have a lot of reverb
on their vocals. However, this is quite noisy, particularly in the
vocal department, so it hardly goes down as sweet as Merchandise's
most palatable tracks... it's sort of like if you took an entire
hour-long Sonic Youth LP and distilled it down to 6 or 7 minutes that
you actually want to listen to.

Contrast Attitude / Aspects of War: Split 7" (Konton Crasher)
Split 7" from these two d-beat powerhouses who recently toured
together. Contrast Attitude are from Japan and are very much in the
Disclose tradition... LOTS of guitars all piled on top of each other
into a gnarly blitzkrieg, but there's also a good bit of traditional
Japanese hardcore in their sound. Their tracks here actually remind me
of a noisier, more chaotic DSB. As for Aspects of War, I've been
hearing a lot of people throw around the "best American d-beat band"
tag, and they definitely make a convincing case here with two
super-raw cuts of pure Disclose worship, leaning a bit more toward the
Disbones era of the band that I've always preferred.

Loose Heart: Paris 1976 7" (Danger)
3 unreleased tracks from this first-wave Paris punk band, one of whom
went on to be in Stinky Toys. This is 1976, so it's right on the
bleeding edge of first-wave punk, but the sound is surprisingly
aggressive. It sort of reminds me of first-wave Australian bands like
the Chosen Few or the Victims in that you can hear the influence of
various strains of proto-punk, but the super raw production also means
any of these tracks could fit comfortably on a Killed by Death or
Bloodstains comp. Killer!

Casanovas in Heat: Belvidere b/w Destiny St 7" (Katorga Works)
Latest single from this Boston band that features (rather
incongruously) former members of Bloodkrow Butcher. In the "official
description" of this band they're compared to punky late-70s power pop
of the type that Sing Sing Records typically reissues, and I
definitely get that... the combination of shimmery guitars and a beefy
punk backbeat definitely evokes that sound and era. However, I stand
by my claim that the melodic vocals also sound quite a bit like the
tuneful midwest punk of the 80s... I can't help but think of bands
like Squirrel Bait, Mortal Micronotz, and later-era Naked Raygun. Fans
of later-era Government Issue will also find a lot to like here. At
any rate, "Belvidere" is definitely worthy of being a single a-side,
and "Destiny St" isn't too far behind it in terms of quality.

Distort #43 zine
Latest issue of this long-running Aussie punk staple. The bands
covered this time are a little more on the esoteric side: Lakes, St.
Lore, Oily Boys, Low Life, Dribble / Gutter Gods, Prolife, Lucky
Cliche, and Vanessa Amara, but you get the typical high-quality
thought and writing that you've come to expect from Distort. Another
essential issue.

Nuts #14 zine
Latest issue of one of my favorite zines in the US! They continue
with the big, newspaper-sized format and focus on NYC punk that
they've had for the past few issues. This time you get interviews with
Ajax and Goosebumps, some writings on the current Olympia scene, a
bunch of rap record reviews, and of course a ton of awesome artwork
beautifully reproduced, including a full-color poster / mask thing by
Eugene of Crazy Spirit. Essential reading!

People Problem: demo cassette (Helta Skelta)
Demo tape from this new Australian HC band. There's something here of
the wild, power-violence-tinged Aussie hardcore like Extortion's
rawest releases (i.e. Terminal Cancer), but this isn't really straight
up power violence... it's really a bit more metal than that, reminding
me of Carcass in places, but with more straight up hardcore vocals
rather than a metal growl or scream. Fast, blistering stuff with
perfect raw production... recommended if you dig Scapegoat and stuff
like that.

Cold Stare: The Circus 7" (Flatspot)
Debut (I believe?) 7" from this California band on Flatspot Records.
A bit more straightforwardly hardcore than some of the other releases
on Flatspot, this is more like oi!-tinged hardcore a la Violent Minds
or 86 Mentality. Nice, raw production keeps this one simple,
straightforward and tough.

Unbroken Bones: The Last Weapon 7" (Drunk with Power)
Debut 7" from this Russian band who had a few strong tapes in the
past couple of years. For the transition to vinyl things get a little
bit less raw and a little more metallic... obviously their name is a
Broken Bones reference, and they really do sound quite a lot like
Bonecrusher-era Broken Bones here... lots palm-muted riffs with little
dive-bomb solos, but with total hardcore-punk drum beats. Definitely a
ripper of a 7"!

Iron Mind: S/T 12" (Flatspot)
2nd LP from this Canadian HC band. Dark, heavy stuff clearly heavily
influenced by the Cro-Mags, but without any traces of the overtly
metal sound that plagues a lot of bands that go for this tough
hardcore sound. Bruising.

Paradox: S/T 12" (Increase the Pressure)
US press of this Atlanta d-beat band's debut 12". Unlike the European
pressing, this is a 2-sided record with an offset-printed jacket.
Here's what I had to say about the Euro press: "Debut 12" from this
Atlanta d-beat. Furious, bottom-heavy stuff in the doom tradition...
fans of Sorry State's own No Tomorrow will dig this hard, as it has
the same straightforward crust sound infused with the catchiness of
Japanese hardcore. This thing has a huge, powerful (but still slightly
raw) recording and stellar packaging, including a silk-screened b-side
of the record. Top-notch crust here."

Lumpy & the Dumpers: Gnats in the Pisser 7" (Total Punk)
Yes! The long-awaited new Lumpy Single, and it's GREAT. "Gnats in the
Pisser" is easily the best Lumpy song yet, topping even "Sex Pit."
It's got that subtle rock and roll vibe that this band's best songs
have, and a seriously warped, sax solo that somehow sounds like
Rudimentary Peni... total raw, warped punk just like I want it! As for
the b-side, it has a more straightforward hardcore vibe... when Lumpy
remove those rock/classic punk vibes they sound more than a little bit
like Crazy Spirit, which is fine by me. All in all another KILLER
record from this band... must-have!

Manateees: Seek Help 7" (Total Punk)
New record from this punk band from Memphis, TN. In the Total Punk
tradition, it's crazy loud and mean, but thinking back there's a
surprising amount of diversity on this label, so that clearly doesn't
say it all. Manateees definitely seem more in the line with the more
70s-inspired punk bands on the label, but they're so much harder and
meaner than the bands one would typically reference for that (like,
say, the Heartbreakers) that it's really something else entirely. The
combination of rawness, musicianship, and aggression definitely brings
to mind the best and most straightforward Killed by Death bands... at
any rate, this is some raw as hell, filthy and aggressive PUNK.

Baddat for Trubel: Inte Varit Sa Tuff 7" (Total Punk)
Latest single from this Swedish band. They deliver two short tracks,
and as on their earlier stuff the sound here is that of first-gen
Europunk like Ebba Gron or Ivy Green. You can definitely hear the
distinct influence of first-wave UK punk bands, so things are bright
and tuneful, but have a modern garage sense of rawness and power. If
you dig the aforementioned bands or similar stuff like Lost Kids this
one is well worth checking out.

Lewis Dimmick: This Music zine (Wardance)
I'm not sure whether this is to be categorized as a book or just a
square-bound zine, but I do know that this is chock-full of really
interesting stories and anecdotes relating to the world of hardcore
punk. From browsing through I gather that Dimmick played in Our Gang
(who you may know from the New Breed tape compilation), and he's since
gone on to become a proper writer with, like, degrees and stuff. I'd
definitely place the writing in this zine in the realm of creative
nonfiction, but Dimmick knows his audience and keeps the punk/HC scene
right at the forefront of every store, and they're quite interesting
to read. They're also incredibly short (most about 1/2-page long), so
this seems like the perfect thing to sit on the back of your toilet...
not sure whether Dimmick would take that as a compliment or not, but I
can't think of a more prestigious place for a document like this.

Blazing Eye: demo cassette (Overdose)
Finally managed to grab some copies of the demo from this much-talked
about LA band. These guys come from that group of LA bands that are
kind of kindred spirits to the NY / Toxic State scene, and that shows
here, from the risographed j-card down to the buzzing bass sound that
kind of carries the songs. Blazing Eye, though, sound to my ears like
a totally gnarly 80s Japanese HC band. GISM is definitely a reference
point, particularly for the vocals, but you won't find any metal solos
here, just barreling, straightforward hardcore. Definitely one of the
best demos I've heard in recent memory.

Tozcos: demo cassette (Overdose)
Demo tape from this new LA band, and man does it rip! Power,
aggression lady-fronted hardcore punk. You can definitely hear shades
of newer bands like La Misma and Sad Boys, but this isn't really as
pogo-y as the later, and is a little more straightforward hardcore
than the latter. If you dug the Blazing Eye demo you should absolutely
get this as well... totally top-shelf stuff!

SOA: First Demo 7" (Dischord)
First-ever official vinyl release for SOA's long-lost first demo. A
couple of these tracks appeared on the Flex Your Head compilation, but
otherwise these are pretty fresh. In some ways, it's easy to see why
the tracks that were originally release were the ones that came out...
there are certainly some sloppy moments on the tracks I hadn't heard
before, but as it goes with this stuff the sloppiness is actually
pretty charming. As with all of Dischord's recent releases, this comes
in awesome, period-appropriate packaging with lots of vintage pictures
and goodies, and we even have the limited red vinyl version while
supplies last.

Undecided: Complications 7" (Eye 95)
Archival release from this 80s DC/Maryland HC band on the same label
that brought us Void's Condensed Flesh 7". Undecided, however, have a
more melodic bent... they remind me of Dag Nasty-influenced 80s
straight edge bands like Justice League, early Verbal Assault, and
Turning Point, though without the straight edge vibes that those bands
had. Basically, this is just fast and catchy 80s punk... bands just
don't sound like this anymore, so if this is your bag check it out.

Oblivionation: Cult of Culture 7" (Man in Decline)
After a well-received demo tape on Bleeding Edges, here's the debut
vinyl from Boston's Oblivionation. They feature John Evicci from Out
Cold on drums, and there's definitely more than a passing similarity
to that band... there's a similar no-nonsense, jackhammer-HC approach
and you definitely won't find anything cheesy like a rock solo or a
melodic part here... just pure, straight up hardcore. That said, the
production is a little heavier than the more Negative
Approach-influenced Out Cold stuff, which makes this sound a little
more full and modern. If you want straight up hardcore, though, you
aren't going to do better than this... totally killer.

Peacebreakers: Every Day Battle 7" (Rock N Roll Disgrace)
Much-hyped debut 7" from this modern Boston Crew band. The praise is
worthy, because this thing rips. It has a bit cleaner sound than bands
like Waste Management... the riffs are big, clean, and catchy,
sounding more like the Boston Strangler than any other band I can
think of, though Peacebreakers definitely have their own tricks up
their sleeves. Of course there's a mandatory oi!-influenced song with
the title track, but most of this is just straight up USHC in the
Negative Approach / SOA mold, and everything is straight-up
note-perfect. Ripping.

Perfect Pussy: Say Yes to Love 12" (Captured Tracks)
First of all, let me say unequivocally that I think this album is
awesome. In my younger years I used to look for bands that evoked the
sound of an era I hadn't actually lived through but wished I did, but
now in my old(er) age I look more and more for bands that sound like
NOW... that sound fresh and of the moment. Perfect Pussy are that band
for the year 2014. I saw them live without having heard a note, they
blew me away, I thought their cassette-only EP was good but perhaps a
little too noisy, but this album captures everything I loved about
their live show. It's just so manic, exciting, passionate, and NOW.
It's not terribly different than what White Lung is doing, but with
added sheets of noise and rawness added on top, which could come off
as very contrived, but for some reason it doesn't here. Maybe it's
because I knew Meredith's old band Shoppers very well and they made a
similarly chaotic racket without a dedicated noise person, or maybe
it's just that the noise is really on point. Whatever the reason, this
album sounds like the winter / spring of 2014, and if you want to live
in the now check this out... it rules.

Bl'ast: The Expression of Power 12" (Southern Lord)
TRIPLE LP reissue of this landmark LP from Bl'ast! Apparently the
band recorded the album three times before they were ultimately
satisfied with the original version that was released on Wishingwell.
This reissue gives us all three versions of the album, each on a
separate LP, so you can decide which one YOU like best.

Offenders: We Must Rebel / Endless Struggle 12" (Southern Lord)
I had no idea this was in the works, so I was stoked to see that
Southern Lord has reissued both of the classic LPs by Texas's the
Offenders. Their first LP, We Must Rebel, is a blistering classic of
80s HC, right up there with their contemporaries MDC and DRI in terms
of straightforward speed and power. However, for me the real gem has
always been Endless Struggle, their underrated second LP. The band
really spread out musically on this one, showcasing their virtuosity
and arriving at something utterly unique. If you're into the more
progressive end of 80s hardcore like Give Thanks-era Articles of Faith
you should definitely give this a listen, as it's some of the best
music the 80s USHC scene had to offer.

Black Zinfandel: I'm Not Sorry cassette (self-released)
Demo tape from this Raleigh, NC band who have been kicking around for
at least a year at this point. Broadly, I'd put their sound along the
lines of twangy neo-garage a la the kind of stuff that Slovenly
Records tends to put out, but I really like Black Zin a lot more than
most of those bands. I think there's a pop sensibility at work that
really makes this hang together much better, and the band isn't afraid
to bounce around difference sub-genres within the broad garage
umbrella. I also love Brian's vocals, which remind me a lot of Chris
Bailey from the Saints. By the way, Seth from Sorry State played bass
on this and Daniel from Sorry State recorded it, so these guys are
definitely part of the SS family!

Warthog: S/T 7" (Katorga Works)
Yeah, everyone has been anticipating this one for a while... well,
it's finally here and it rips! Total unhinged, Pick Your King-style HC
punk from these NYC miscreants. I was super into this band's demo and
live show and the EP absolutely fulfills all expectations. If you like
Gas Rag, classic Poison Idea, or similarly blazing hardcore punk you
need this one. Great packaging too, including a sick cover
illustration courtesy Death Traitors and a large, full-color poster
insert. Highly recommended.

The Corpse: S/T 7" (Distort Reality)
Debut 7" from this Portland band. I remember these guys had a demo
several years back (maybe even as long as 5 years ago) that I was
SUPER stoked on, and it sounds like they haven't lost a step since.
Total balls-to-the-wall punk with a similarly manic vibe to Gas Rag,
though not as d-beat-y. The combination of catchy bass lines and
blistering metallic guitar work on this one makes me think of Direct
Control if they were way more influenced by the Accused and Attitude
Adjustment. A total ripper... recommended.

Well, this is a big update for a change! First up we have 2 brand new =
releases on Sorry State, both demos from North Carolina bands. In fact, we =
have new demos from all three contributors to this newsletter this month, =
but it looks like we're currently out of Seth's band, Black Zinfandel, so =
someone bug him to bring us more!<br><br>
Anyway, first up is the debut tape from Jeff's new band Skem&auml;ta. =
Here's the description:<br><br>
<img border=3D0 width=3D"500" height=3D"500" src=3D"http://cdn.shopify.com=
/s/files/1/0255/7539/products/IMG_2477_1024x1024.jpg?v=3D1396029569"><br><=

After the demise of Stripmines in the summer of 2012, Jeff Young (guitar) =
and Alex Taylor (bass) kept writing songs, looking for the perfect lineup =
to keep pushing forward their unique brand of raw, fast, and technical =
hardcore. Eventually recruiting Cameron Craig (Logic Problem, Double =
Negative, Davidians) on drums and Usman on vocals, Skem&auml;ta started =
playing shows in late 2013 and were immediately a force to be reckoned =
with. Fans of Stripmines will certainly love them, but Skem&auml;ta =
incorporates a bunch of new influences as well, like the subtle melodic =
qualities of Sickoids and the rawer, more direct hardcore of bands like =
Framtid and Bastard. Watch for a debut LP from these guys on Sorry State =
later this summer. This release is limited to 150 copies with 2-sided, =
screen printed j-cards, pro-duplicated tapes and download code.<br><br>
Secondly, we have a pretty killer tape from a project I did this past =
summer called Narcoman... here's the info on that:<br><br>
<img border=3D0 width=3D"500" height=3D"500" src=3D"http://cdn.shopify.com=
/s/files/1/0255/7539/products/IMG_2478_1024x1024.jpg?v=3D1396029489"><br><=
br>
When Raleigh&rsquo;s Cross Laws broke up in 2007, Matt and Daniel went on =
to form Devour, but Dennis (bass and vocals) took an entirely different =
path, serving two years as part of the Peace Corps in Turkmenistan and =
then returning to North Carolina to be a high school teacher in Asheville. =
While he wasn&rsquo;t actively playing in any bands, Dennis had his guitar =
with him through this entire period, crafting and refining a huge backlog =
of songs. In the summer of 2013 Dennis got together with fellow Cross Laws =
alumnus Daniel as well as Cameron Craig (Logic Problem, Double Negative, =
Skem&auml;ta) on drums to make raw 4-track recordings of 4 of these songs. =
The results are quite a bit different from Cross Laws&hellip; more =
complex, refined, melodic, and subtle, Narcoman recalls the best of =
ambitious, catchy 80s hardcore like Articles of Faith, early Husker Du, =
and Upright Citizens. This release is limited to 150 copies with a =
screen-printed j-card, pro-duplicated tapes and download code.<br><br>
As I noted in the descriptions, both of these demos feature pretty darn =
handsome packaging including screen printed j-cards by me and =
pro-duplicated cassettes. And as per usual they're both up on <a =
href=3D"http://t.ymlp278.net/uhuaiaujuuqafaybavaeuem/click.php">the Sorry =
State BandCamp site</a> if you want to check them out before =
ordering.<br><br>
Things are starting to move on a couple of other upcoming releases, but =
nothing's ready to be announced just yet... maybe next month?<br><br>

"><br><br>
There's also a LOT going on this month in terms of shows. I'm beyond =
psyched to say, for the first time in a long time, that I'll be catching a =
few Brain F&ne; gigs this weekend. First up is this Friday at the =
Milestone in Charlotte (Facebook event <a =
href=3D"http://t.ymlp278.net/uheapaujuuqataybavaeuem/click.php">here</a>), =
and then they're also playing Phuzz Phest in Winston-Salem on Saturday. =
Catch me up front losing my shit at both gigs.<br><br>
Whatever Brains are also playing a whole bunch of shows this month, =
including an appearance at Phuzz Phest playing before Kool Keith(!!!). =
Whatever Brains are currently brandishing a brand new bassist, but he =
wasn't available to go on the Protomartyr tour, so Anthony from =
Winston-Salem acts like Burglar Fucker and Primo Van Halen will be filling =
in. I hear that the NC shows will actually feature both bassists, which =
should make for an interesting experience. Oh, and most of these dates are =
with Protomartyr, whose new LP absolutely rules... I'll have that in the =
distro this coming month. Here's the full slate of dates:<br><br>
4/3 - raleigh @ slim's w/ PC WORSHIP, WINSTON FACIALS<br>
4/6 - winston-salem @ ziggy's w/ KOOL KEITH, MISS EAVES, TOON AND THE REAL =
LAWW<br>
4/17 - raleigh @ slim's again w/ PROTOMARTYR, SPRAY PAINT<br>
4/18 - atlanta @ 529 w/ PROTOFARTR, SPRAY PAINT<br>
4/19 - tallahassee @ liberty bar w/ PROTOSHARTR<br>
4/20 - blazin doobies w/ PROTOLARPR<br>
4/21 - new orleans @ circle bar w/ PROTOPARTYR<br>
4/22 - birmingham @ bottle tree w/ PROTOBARTYNDYR, DEISM<br>
4/23 - nashville @ stone fox w/ PROTOTHECARTERIII, CHEAP TIME<br>
4/24 - cincinnati @ motr pub w/ PROTOOLSMARTYR<br>
4/25 - cleveland @ now that's class w/ PRILOSECOTC<br><br>
I'm also booking a couple of gigs in town this month that promise to be =
scorchers... first up is Good Throb and Priests with No Love (Seth and I's =
band):<br><br>
<img border=3D0 height=3D"450" src=3D"https://scontent-b-iad.xx.fbcdn.net/=

<a =

<a =
href=3D"http://t.ymlp278.net/uhjalaujuuqaoaybapaeuem/click.php">Facebook =
event</a><br><br>
This show will be the debut for a new band called Prosthesis, which Jeff =
and I both play in. This band is composed of Jeff and Ira from Stripmines =
and me and Dave from Devour, along with David from Vacant Planet on =
guitar. If you were a fan of Devour, you should be stoked about this band =
as it kind of picks up where we left off... total uncomfortable =
hardcore/metal vibes a la early Neurosis or something like that... =
hopefully we can also record sometime this spring.<br><br>
As if that weren't a big enough to-do list for this month, there's also =
Damaged City Fest weekend after next, where I'll be hopefully dragging a =
table full of distro records and Jeff's band Mercy Killings will also be =
playing. I really wish I could make it to New York's Alright as well =
(DiE... ugh! I hate to miss them so much!), but that falls on Record Store =
Day weekend so I will sadly be absent.<br><br>
Alright folks, I think that's enough for one month!<br><br>

Hey Sorry Staters!!<br><br>
Been at the store a little less lately because I&rsquo;ve been outta town =
a bunch on my normal workdays.
Still, there&rsquo;s been some killer new releases in the last few weeks.
First of all, if you like good hardcore, you NEED that Oblivionation =
7&rdquo;.
So killer. I&rsquo;ll just leave you with that for this month.<br><br>
On a personal note, the Skem&auml;ta demo tape is out, and I&rsquo;m so =
stoked.
I&rsquo;m also happy to say that in a few weeks we&rsquo;ll be going to =
record our LP for Sorry State.
New songs, and a thicker sound.
That should hopefully be out late summer time.
Also, we&rsquo;ll be playing some out of town dates in May, so be on the =
lookout for us when we come your way!<br><br>
Also, I wanted to use this as a vehicle to express thanks to everyone who =
showed Mercy Killings a good time this past weekend.
We&rsquo;ll be playing Damaged City in a couple weeks, and then =
we&rsquo;re also going to record for a new record at the end of April. =
<br><br>
Thanks for reading.
See you all next month!<br><br>

This month has been a good month for females in music; the Tozcos tape is =
killer, I really dug the new Coathangers LP... it's the perfect amount of =
dirt and dream.
Also I really likes the Julie Ruin LP; it's a good balance of Le Tigre and =
Bikini Kill. The artwork for the Perfect Pussy album threw me off but it's =
fantastic, super punk with lots going on to make it interesting and stand =
out. My other pick is Ukiah Drag... great dirty garage punk.<br><br>

Man, I feel like I have a lot to talk about this month! First of all, we =
got in some great new releases... you can't go wrong in a month when you =
have a new Lumpy & the Dumpers single, and the other hyped new releases =
from Warthog, Oblivionation, and Peacebreakers all deliver as well. I was =
also stoked to get copies of the Blazing Eye and Tozcos demos... great raw =
hardcore from both bands. The new Casanovas in Heat single has also spent =
a lot of time on the store's turntable, and they were great live as =
well... honestly, though, the record that is really blowing my mind this =
month is the reissue of the <i>Avon Calling</i> compilation LP. It really =
doesn't get any better than this as far as regional comps go... the lineup =
is incredible diverse, but every band delivers top-notch work.<br><br>
I should also mention that thanks to an incredibly busy month I've had =
trouble keeping up with adding new releases and restocks to this =
newsletter... just off the top of my head I can see I didn't mention the =
sick new Anti-Dogmatikks reissue below, and there's a lot of other stuff =
on the site not mentioned here either. Have a browse if you have some free =
time!<br><br>
Also, we just had a big batch of stuff come in today including the two new =
Toxic State cassettes from Black Boot and Deformity, restocks of a bunch =
of in print Toxic State stuff, the new Predator LP, and a bunch of other =
things. Those are on the site already so you can feel free to order, but =
descriptions and such will be on the next update. Oh, and we're still =
shipping most orders within 24 hours, so you'll get your stuff =
quickly!<br><br>
Finally, our 7" bins have gotten really full, so I added around 300 used =
7"s to the web site. There's not a lot of the rare hardcore that's the =
shop's specialty (there are a few things though!), but there are some =
interesting odds and ends... most used things added to the site won't show =
up at the front of the New Arrivals section, so you may want to browse =
through <a =
href=3D"http://t.ymlp278.net/uhbataujuuqataybazaeuem/click.php">the used =
section of the site</a> every now and again... hopefully we'll be able to =
add some used LPs soon as well as there are a couple of scorchers that =
have been sitting in the shop for way too long.<br><br>
Oh, and if you ever want to sell or trade your used records to Sorry State =
we're happy to do this through the mail! If you don't have a solid used =
record store in your area, don't feel like mailing out dozens of =
individual orders necessary to do an online set sale or discogs / ebay, we =
can buy small or large collections through the mail and either pay you =
with trade credit for the webstore, cash in your paypal account, or a =
check through the mail. If anyone out there is interested please get in =
touch as we're always on the hunt for used punk records!<br><br>

Narcoman: demo cassette (Sorry State)<br>
When Raleigh&rsquo;s Cross Laws broke up in 2007, Matt and Daniel went on =
to form Devour, but Dennis (bass and vocals) took an entirely different =
path, serving two years as part of the Peace Corps in Turkmenistan and =
then returning to North Carolina to be a high school teacher in Asheville. =
While he wasn&rsquo;t actively playing in any bands, Dennis had his guitar =
with him through this entire period, crafting and refining a huge backlog =
on songs. In the summer of 2013 Dennis got together with fellow Cross Laws =
alumnus Daniel as well as Cameron Craig (Logic Problem, Double Negative, =
Skem&auml;ta) on drums to make raw 4-track recordings of 4 of these songs. =
The results are quite a bit different from Cross Laws&hellip; more =
complex, refined, melodic, and subtle, Narcoman recalls the best of =
ambitious, catchy 80s hardcore like Articles of Faith, early Husker Du, =
and Upright Citizens. This release is limited to 150 copies with a =
screen-printed j-card, pro-duplicate tapes and download code.<br><br>

Ukiah Drag: <i>Dirt Trip</i> 7" (Wharf Cat)<br>
Debut 7" from this band features some members of some Florida bands you =
might have heard of, but Ukiah Drag actually resides in New England. The =
a-side here is a dense, lurching post-punk song... it's very =
song-oriented, unlike a lot of post-punk stuff I've been hearing lately, =
and actually reminds me a bit of some of the stuff on Olympia's Perennial =
Records. As for the b-side, it's a little different, with a kind of =
fall-inspired rockabilly lurch... it actually reminds me a bit of Whatever =
Brains (except the vocals), so I guess by extension it can also fit in =
with that whole Protomartyr / PC Worship / etc. scene... a killer single =
with sick artwork to boot.<br><br>

Various: <i>Avon Calling</i> 12" (Radiation)<br>
Reissue of this absolutely STELLAR regional comp from 70s Bristol, =
England. The only two bands I was familiar with going in were Glaxo Babies =
and Vice Squad, but all of the unknowns collected here are really blowing =
my mind. As with the best regional comps, there's a diversity in styles, =
ranging from song-oriented UKDIY to straight punk to some tracks that =
almost border on a NWOBHM-type sound. Actually, I think Vice Squad have =
probably the weakest track here, and it's not even weak... it's a solid =
Vice Squad song. If you're generally interested in what was happening in =
the late 70s UK underground, this is a must-hear... highest possible =
recommendation!<br><br>

SFN / In Disgust: Split 7" (Drugged Conscience)<br>
Apparently this split was originally conceived as a 5", but after some =
serious production delays it now sees light of day as a split 1-sided 7". =
Both bands play super fast power violence / grind, but this is totally =
legit... it's no weak teeny-bopper power violence. The rawness and the =
intricacy of changes reminds me quite a bit of the original Crossed Out / =
No Comment / Man Is the Bastard / etc. axis... this contains some really =
inventive riffing and perfect raw production that makes this sound go down =
right.<br><br>

Dads: <i>Invisible Blouse</i> 7" (Wharf Cat)<br>
New pressing of this single from the same Tampa scene that birthed bands =
like Cult Ritual, Merchandise, Neon Blud, etc. Of those bands, Merchandise =
is probably the best reference point, as Dads seem similarly inspired by =
the long tradition of British guitar pop that is at least vaguely =
Smiths-inspired, and they also have a lot of reverb on their vocals. =
However, this is quite noisy, particularly in the vocal department, so it =
hardly goes down as sweet as Merchandise's most palatable tracks... it's =
sort of like if you took an entire hour-long Sonic Youth LP and distilled =
it down to 6 or 7 minutes that you actually want to listen to.<br><br>

Contrast Attitude / Aspects of War: Split 7" (Konton Crasher)<br>
Split 7" from these two d-beat powerhouses who recently toured together. =
Contrast Attitude are from Japan and are very much in the Disclose =
tradition... LOTS of guitars all piled on top of each other into a gnarly =
blitzkrieg, but there's also a good bit of traditional Japanese hardcore =
in their sound. Their tracks here actually remind me of a noisier, more =
chaotic DSB. As for Aspects of War, I've been hearing a lot of people =
throw around the "best American d-beat band" tag, and they definitely make =
a convincing case here with two super-raw cuts of pure Disclose worship, =
leaning a bit more toward the Disbones era of the band that I've always =
preferred.<br><br>

Loose Heart: <i>Paris 1976</i> 7" (Danger)<br>
3 unreleased tracks from this first-wave Paris punk band, one of whom went =
on to be in Stinky Toys. This is 1976, so it's right on the bleeding edge =
of first-wave punk, but the sound is surprisingly aggressive. It sort of =
reminds me of first-wave Australian bands like the Chosen Few or the =
Victims in that you can hear the influence of various strains of =
proto-punk, but the super raw production also means any of these tracks =
could fit comfortably on a <i>Killed by Death</i> or <i>Bloodstains</i> =
comp. Killer!<br><br>

Casanovas in Heat: <i>Belvidere b/w Destiny St</i> 7" (Katorga Works)<br>
Latest single from this Boston band that features (rather incongruously) =
former members of Bloodkrow Butcher. In the "official description" of this =
band they're compared to punky late-70s power pop of the type that Sing =
Sing Records typically reissues, and I definitely get that... the =
combination of shimmery guitars and a beefy punk backbeat definitely =
evokes that sound and era. However, I stand by my claim that the melodic =
vocals also sound quite a bit like the tuneful midwest punk of the 80s... =
I can't help but think of bands like Squirrel Bait, Mortal Micronotz, and =
later-era Naked Raygun. Fans of later-era Government Issue will also find =
a lot to like here. At any rate, "Belvidere" is definitely worthy of being =
a single a-side, and "Destiny St" isn't too far behind it in terms of =
quality.<br><br>

this time are a little more on the esoteric side: Lakes, St. Lore, Oily =

some writings on the current Olympia scene, a bunch of rap record reviews, =
and of course a ton of awesome artwork beautifully reproduced, including a =

People Problem: demo cassette (Helta Skelta)<br>
Demo tape from this new Australian HC band. There's something here of the =
wild, power-violence-tinged Aussie hardcore like Extortion's rawest =
releases (i.e. <i>Terminal Cancer</i>), but this isn't really straight up =
power violence... it's really a bit more metal than that, reminding me of =
Carcass in places, but with more straight up hardcore vocals rather than a =
metal growl or scream. Fast, blistering stuff with perfect raw =
production... recommended if you dig Scapegoat and stuff like =
that.<br><br>

Cold Stare: <i>The Circus</i> 7" (Flatspot)<br>
Debut (I believe?) 7" from this California band on Flatspot Records. A bit =

Mentality. Nice, raw production keeps this one simple, straightforward and =
tough.<br><br>

Unbroken Bones: <i>The Last Weapon</i> 7" (Drunk with Power)<br>
Debut 7" from this Russian band who had a few strong tapes in the past =
couple of years. For the transition to vinyl things get a little bit less =
raw and a little more metallic... obviously their name is a Broken Bones =
reference, and they really do sound quite a lot like =
<i>Bonecrusher</i>-era Broken Bones here... lots palm-muted riffs with =
little dive-bomb solos, but with total hardcore-punk drum beats. =
Definitely a ripper of a 7"!<br><br>

Paradox: S/T 12" (Increase the Pressure)<br>
US press of this Atlanta d-beat band's debut 12". Unlike the European =
pressing, this is a 2-sided record with an offset-printed jacket. Here's =
what I had to say about the Euro press: "Debut 12" from this Atlanta =
d-beat. Furious, bottom-heavy stuff in the doom tradition... fans of Sorry =
State's own No Tomorrow will dig this hard, as it has the same =
straightforward crust sound infused with the catchiness of Japanese =
hardcore. This thing has a huge, powerful (but still slightly raw) =
recording and stellar packaging, including a silk-screened b-side of the =
record. Top-notch crust here."<br><br>

Lumpy & the Dumpers: <i>Gnats in the Pisser</i> 7" (Total Punk)<br>
Yes! The long-awaited new Lumpy Single, and it's GREAT. "Gnats in the =
Pisser" is easily the best Lumpy song yet, topping even "Sex Pit." It's =
got that subtle rock and roll vibe that this band's best songs have, and a =
seriously warped, sax solo that somehow sounds like Rudimentary Peni... =
total raw, warped punk just like I want it! As for the b-side, it has a =
more straightforward hardcore vibe... when Lumpy remove those rock/classic =
punk vibes they sound more than a little bit like Crazy Spirit, which is =
fine by me. All in all another KILLER record from this band... =
must-have!<br><br>

Manateees: <i>Seek Help</i> 7" (Total Punk)<br>
New record from this punk band from Memphis, TN. In the Total Punk =
tradition, it's crazy loud and mean, but thinking back there's a =
surprising amount of diversity on this label, so that clearly doesn't say =
it all. Manateees definitely seem more in the line with the more =
70s-inspired punk bands on the label, but they're so much harder and =
meaner than the bands one would typically reference for that (like, say, =
the Heartbreakers) that it's really something else entirely. The =
combination of rawness, musicianship, and aggression definitely brings to =
mind the best and most straightforward Killed by Death bands... at any =
rate, this is some raw as hell, filthy and aggressive PUNK.<br><br>

Baddat for Trubel: <i>Inte Varit Sa Tuff</i> 7" (Total Punk)<br>
Latest single from this Swedish band. They deliver two short tracks, and =
as on their earlier stuff the sound here is that of first-gen Europunk =
like Ebba Gron or Ivy Green. You can definitely hear the distinct =
influence of first-wave UK punk bands, so things are bright and tuneful, =
but have a modern garage sense of rawness and power. If you dig the =
aforementioned bands or similar stuff like Lost Kids this one is well =
worth checking out.<br><br>

Lewis Dimmick: <i>This Music</i> zine (Wardance)<br>
I'm not sure whether this is to be categorized as a book or just a =

interesting stories and anecdotes relating to the world of hardcore punk. =
From browsing through I gather that Dimmick played in Our Gang (who you =
may know from the <i>New Breed</i> tape compilation), and he's since gone =
on to become a proper writer with, like, degrees and stuff. I'd definitely =
place the writing in this zine in the realm of creative nonfiction, but =
Dimmick knows his audience and keeps the punk/HC scene right at the =
forefront of every store, and they're quite interesting to read. They're =
also incredibly short (most about 1/2-page long), so this seems like the =
perfect thing to sit on the back of your toilet... not sure whether =
Dimmick would take that as a compliment or not, but I can't think of a =
more prestigious place for a document like this.<br><br>

Blazing Eye: demo cassette (Overdose)<br>
Finally managed to grab some copies of the demo from this much-talked =
about LA band. These guys come from that group of LA bands that are kind =
of kindred spirits to the NY / Toxic State scene, and that shows here, =
from the risographed j-card down to the buzzing bass sound that kind of =
carries the songs. Blazing Eye, though, sound to my ears like a totally =
gnarly 80s Japanese HC band. GISM is definitely a reference point, =
particularly for the vocals, but you won't find any metal solos here, just =
barreling, straightforward hardcore. Definitely one of the best demos I've =
heard in recent memory.<br><br>

SOA: <i>First Demo</i> 7" (Dischord)<br>
First-ever official vinyl release for SOA's long-lost first demo. A couple =

otherwise these are pretty fresh. In some ways, it's easy to see why the =
tracks that were originally release were the ones that came out... there =

as it goes with this stuff the sloppiness is actually pretty charming. As =

Archival release from this 80s DC/Maryland HC band on the same label that =

more melodic bent... they remind me of Dag Nasty-influenced 80s straight =
edge bands like Justice League, early Verbal Assault, and Turning Point, =

Oblivionation: <i>Cult of Culture</i> 7" (Man in Decline)<br>
After a well-received demo tape on Bleeding Edges, here's the debut vinyl =
from Boston's Oblivionation. They feature John Evicci from Out Cold on =
drums, and there's definitely more than a passing similarity to that =
band... there's a similar no-nonsense, jackhammer-HC approach and you =
definitely won't find anything cheesy like a rock solo or a melodic part =
here... just pure, straight up hardcore. That said, the production is a =
little heavier than the more Negative Approach-influenced Out Cold stuff, =
which makes this sound a little more full and modern. If you want straight =
up hardcore, though, you aren't going to do better than this... totally =
killer.<br><br>

Peacebreakers: <i>Every Day Battle</i> 7" (Rock N Roll Disgrace)<br>
Much-hyped debut 7" from this modern Boston Crew band. The praise is =
worthy, because this thing rips. It has a bit cleaner sound than bands =
like Waste Management... the riffs are big, clean, and catchy, sounding =
more like the Boston Strangler than any other band I can think of, though =
Peacebreakers definitely have their own tricks up their sleeves. Of course =
there's a mandatory oi!-influenced song with the title track, but most of =
this is just straight up USHC in the Negative Approach / SOA mold, and =
everything is straight-up note-perfect. Ripping.<br><br>

Perfect Pussy: <i>Say Yes to Love</i> 12" (Captured Tracks)<br>
First of all, let me say unequivocally that I think this album is awesome. =
In my younger years I used to look for bands that evoked the sound of an =
era I hadn't actually lived through but wished I did, but now in my =
old(er) age I look more and more for bands that sound like NOW... that =
sound fresh and of the moment. Perfect Pussy are that band for the year =
2014. I saw them live without having heard a note, they blew me away, I =
thought their cassette-only EP was good but perhaps a little too noisy, =
but this album captures everything I loved about their live show. It's =
just so manic, exciting, passionate, and NOW. It's not terribly different =
than what White Lung is doing, but with added sheets of noise and rawness =
added on top, which could come off as very contrived, but for some reason =
it doesn't here. Maybe it's because I knew Meredith's old band Shoppers =
very well and they made a similarly chaotic racket without a dedicated =
noise person, or maybe it's just that the noise is really on point. =
Whatever the reason, this album sounds like the winter / spring of 2014, =
and if you want to live in the now check this out... it rules.<br><br>

up there with their contemporaries MDC and DRI in terms of straightforward =
speed and power. However, for me the real gem has always been <i>Endless =
Struggle</i>, their underrated second LP. The band really spread out =
musically on this one, showcasing their virtuosity and arriving at =
something utterly unique. If you're into the more progressive end of 80s =
hardcore like <i>Give Thanks</i>-era Articles of Faith you should =
definitely give this a listen, as it's some of the best music the 80s USHC =
scene had to offer.<br><br>

Black Zinfandel: <i>I'm Not Sorry</i> cassette (self-released)<br>
Demo tape from this Raleigh, NC band who have been kicking around for at =
least a year at this point. Broadly, I'd put their sound along the lines =
of twangy neo-garage a la the kind of stuff that Slovenly Records tends to =
put out, but I really like Black Zin a lot more than most of those bands. =
I think there's a pop sensibility at work that really makes this hang =
together much better, and the band isn't afraid to bounce around =
difference sub-genres within the broad garage umbrella. I also love =
Brian's vocals, which remind me a lot of Chris Bailey from the Saints. By =
the way, Seth from Sorry State played bass on this and Daniel from Sorry =
State recorded it, so these guys are definitely part of the SS =
family!<br><br>

Warthog: S/T 7" (Katorga Works)<br>
Yeah, everyone has been anticipating this one for a while... well, it's =
finally here and it rips! Total unhinged, <i>Pick Your King</i>-style HC =
punk from these NYC miscreants. I was super into this band's demo and live =
show and the EP absolutely fulfills all expectations. If you like Gas Rag, =
classic Poison Idea, or similarly blazing hardcore punk you need this one. =
Great packaging too, including a sick cover illustration courtesy Death =
Traitors and a large, full-color poster insert. Highly =
recommended.<br><br>

The Corpse: S/T 7" (Distort Reality)<br>
Debut 7" from this Portland band. I remember these guys had a demo several =
years back (maybe even as long as 5 years ago) that I was SUPER stoked on, =
and it sounds like they haven't lost a step since. Total balls-to-the-wall =
punk with a similarly manic vibe to Gas Rag, though not as d-beat-y. The =
combination of catchy bass lines and blistering metallic guitar work on =
this one makes me think of Direct Control if they were way more influenced =
by the Accused and Attitude Adjustment. A total ripper... =
recommended.<br><br>
