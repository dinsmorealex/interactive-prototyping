Available: Apr 01, 2014 through Apr 30, 2014

Hi,
I have a share in a big, beautiful, former classroom in the Lower East Side.  It's a wonderful neighborhood for art-making and art-seeing.  Close to galleries, 2 blocks from F train, all the food wonders you could dream of! 

I share the studio with a writer and an installation artist.  Important: the writer needs for the studio to be quiet while she works (mostly daytime hours).  Headphones are fine. 

My reason for subletting is to save some money for a residency this summer.  There are a few options for subletting my share in the studio.  
1) You can sublet from me 100% and it will be your studio (with some of my stuff in it) for the month of April with the possibility of continuing beyond.
2) You and I can share my space within the studio by doing alternate dates or evenings vs...

About the Apartment:
This is an amazingly huge and beautiful apartment.

$950.00 Per Month, Red Hook, Brooklyn, Spacious Room Available in 2br Red Hook Apt with Backyard
Available: Apr 01, 2014

I am looking for a roommate to move into my lovely, homey apartment in Red Hook on April 1 (April 15 flexible). I am a 27 year old female working full time (9-5ish) in publishing. I'm pretty social so I'm not home a whole lot but when I am home, I'm pretty low key.

The apartment has a shared bath, smallish but fully stocked kitchen, and cozy living room with Roku projector (includes Netflix, Hulu, HBO Go, etc). The room available for rent is very spacious with windows overlooking the street (with a low level of noise).

Available: May 01, 2014

We're looking to sublet one of the bedrooms in our 3br apartment in Bed-Stuy, 2 blocks away from the Nostrand A/C stop. The room has its own closet, window, hardwood floors, and fits a queen bed with room to spare. 

I looked far and wide to find this apartment, and honestly can say it blows people away when they see it. The building was renovated just a year ago, and they gave us a brand new washer/dryer in the kitchen when we moved in last year. The building is a safe walk up, the ceilings are high, and the common areas are massive. Our kitchen and living room areas are truly a wonder to behold - especially for people used to tiny and cramped apartments. We sometimes have to yell to each other because we're so far away from one another in our own apartment. Also excuse the messy/empty...

$1,800.00 Per Month, Ditmas Park/Kensington, Brooklyn, Family of 4 seeking 2 bed in Ditmas/Kensington (PS 217 zone)
Available: May 15, 2014

We're a family of 4 looking for a 2 (or more) bedroom apartment in Ditmas/Kensington, specifically the zone of PS 217. We'd love to keep the rent around 1800/mo, but we do have some flexibility above that. Big buildings, private homes, or two/three family homes are all options. If in a home, we'd be happy to take on some responsibilities such as snow shoveling or trash/recycling maintenance in exchange for reduced rent. 

Our ideal date to start the new lease is May 15, but we have flexibility from now through June 1. We'd also love to find a place with laundry in the building, or unit (!!), and would love to be on the first or second floor or with an elevator.

I'm looking for a room or apr. where I can sleep, eat, shower and do some writing.

During the week I will be really busy with either class or my internships, so I'll probably go to sleep pretty early or climb in bed to read or watch Netflix. On the weekends, I'll probably be semi busy going to museums and wandering around and stuff, and at night I'll probably go out. I'm also down to...
