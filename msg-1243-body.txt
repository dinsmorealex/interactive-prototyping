   More About Pratt
   Pratt offers over 20  different programs in its three graduate
   schools: architecture, art and design, and information and library
   science.  Recognized internationally for the quality of its
   programs, faculty, and students, Pratt was ranked number one in the
   country for seven years  by both US News and World Reports Best
   Graduate Schools and DesignIntelligence for interior design.
   Pratt's professors are successful professional artists, designers,
   architects, and writers who take time out from their busy schedules
   to teach, serve as mentors and advisers, and help our students find
   internships and eventually jobs when they graduate.

   Pratt's 25-acre enclosed grassy [3]tree-lined [4]campus with
   on-campus residence halls, a contemporary sculpture park, historic
   buildings, brick pathways, athletic center complete with varsity
   and intramural sports, and beautifully landscaped
   grounds,  provides students with a traditional college experience
   just minutes from Manhattan in of the most famous art schools in
   the world.

    In the meantime, visit our website, and read about our
   [5]application requirements.  Make sure you also read
   the[6] departmental requirements.  The fall 12  application
   deadline is January 5; the summer deadline for the post
   professional architecture and the urban design programs is also
   January 5, but we urge you to apply by December 1 to ensure enough
   time for processing. The spring deadline was October 1, but we are
   still accepting applications.
   View [7]graduate student work by department below the admissions
   gallery.
   We look forward to seeing you at one of our events.
   Sincerely yours,

   Judith Aaron
   Vice President for Enrollment
