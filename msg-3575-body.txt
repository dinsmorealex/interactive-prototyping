Listings Project Story of the Week:

Your list is a breath of fresh air and we remain eternally grateful for its=
 service.
My boyfriend and I found our sublet on Listings Project (after agonizing we=

trolling craigslist and meeting with sketchy brokers) and we are completely=
 in love
with the place. Thank you for creating such a wonderful community here.

All best,

Nicole

Nice natural light from two big windows. 12 ft ceilings, wooden floors,  2n=

more.

 you=20
need to spread out temporarily, not a problem. Probably  not appropriate fo=
r super
dusty, toxic work or someone with a ton of  stuff.

ROOMS FOR RENT

$1000 per month, Williamsburg, 7x15 ft, Room Available in light, beautiful =
brownstone
apartment in South Williamsburg
Available: 6/1/13 through 12/1/13
Hi! We are two 27 year old girls, Australian and Brazilian, and we have a  =
spare
 room in our South Williamsburg place on South Fifth Street. It is  2 block=
s from
the JMZ Macy Ave stop (in Manhattan in 5 mins!) and a  short ten minute wal=
k to=20
the L train. The neighbourhood is awesome,  close to everything but still h=
as original
charm! And is very close to  some great bars and restaurants like Diner, Ma=
rlow=20
& Sons, The  Lighthouse, Fatty Cue etc.
The room is in the back of the house and looks out to the building's  back =
garden
(we are both up the front), there is a big window, a  built-in cupboard, fl=
oorboards
and it is long rather than wide! 7 feet  by 15 ft approximately.
The living space is big and open.
We are on the first floor and our street is leafy and pretty quiet.  There =
is a=20
great supermarket (Mr Pina) a couple of blocks away and loads  of laundroma=
ts etc.
We are good friends and are both study Lighting Design and Interior Arch  a=
t Parsons.
We're super busy during semester however we start summer  break in a week a=
nd will
be at home more than usual.
We moved in a month ago and have started setting up the place but you can b=
e part
of creating our new home!
We are clean and pretty quiet (apart from playing music). We are looking  f=
or someone
who is warm and open and a respectful housemate. While we  are not uptight =
please
don't apply if you are not clean and unable to do  housework!
Also, we have put down that it is available for 6 months but if it is worki=
ng out
well it can definitely be more long term.
Please get in touch if you are interested. Write us an email and tell us ab=
out yourself.
Thanks and look forward to meeting you!!

$1100 per month, Greenpoint, 10x10, Safe and quiet room available in beauti=
ful area
Available: 6/1/2013 through 5/31/2014
- 1 Room for rent starting June 1 for one individual in Greenpoint, Brookly=
n
- $1100 utilities and Internet included ($30 additional for air conditioner=
 use)
- Non-smokers please
- 420 friendly to a reasonable degree
- No pets please
Greenpoint is one of the safest, quietest, quaintest, prettiest and most  c=
onvenient
neighborhoods the city has to offer. Five blocks away you  have the East Ri=
ver Ferry,
which for four dollars will shuttle you  directly to Midtown (as well as Wi=
lliamsburg,
Dumbo and Governor's  Island). The G train is less than a 5-minute walk fro=
m the
 location and  connections can be made to the L, E, M and 7 trains. All tra=
ins are
 within walking distance. McCarren Park is close by with a large green  spa=
ce, playgrounds,
track and a Farmer's Market on Saturdays. If you  have a car, parking is re=
latively
easy to find in the neighborhood.  Regular alternative side of the street p=
arking
rules apply.
I am seeking a professional or student who is neat and who understands  the=
 importance
of cleaning up immediately after making a mess (mainly in  the kitchen area=
) and
 also has no problem sharing the cleaning  responsibilities in the entire h=
ousehold.
I am searching for a person  who has an active work/school life, does not s=
pend=20
a lot of time in the  apartment and can keep noise to a minimum during nigh=
ttime
 hours.  Weekends, of course, are a different story.
About the apartment:
Two bedrooms and a small bathroom with shelving space available. The  kitch=
en has
all the necessary appointments and a small kitchen table  that seats 4. The=
re is
 a patio area that I am planning to turn into a  brunch nook but that is st=
ill in
the works so if you have any  suggestions as to how this area can be decora=
ted I
 am open to hear them  and do a joint project. The living room has a sofa b=
ed for
guests, a TV  with a DVD player but no cable (I do not plan on getting cabl=
e ever),
 and my desk.
The room for rent has space for a twin or full size bed as well as a  stand=
 alone
closet and shelving. You have the option to paint the room  if you do not l=
ike the
color. Supplies and labor are your responsibility  although I would be happ=
y to=20
help.
A little about your potential roommate:
I am a professional and I work primarily from home. I occasionally have  gu=
ests=20
over but I would rather have my social time outside of the house.  I enjoy =
being
 social with the person I am living with although it is  not necessary that=
 we are
all in each others' business. I think it is  important to be cordial and fr=
iendly
with the people I live with because  I thoroughly appreciate a stress free =
living
environment. I am a firm  believer in communication so, if there is an issu=
e that
involves me or  the household, a respectful an non combative discussion nee=
ds to
 happen.  I like to make costumes as a hobby and you will see me furiously =
sewing
 away on occasion. Dancing is my favorite pastime and I frequently go  and =
shake
 my booty with my people. I like to hoop on occasion and I have  two hoops =
that=20
I tote around with me.
If you are interested or want to learn more please respond to this post!
Couples ARE welcome for an additional monthly fee of $300. Thank you!

room=20
in a beautiful apartment! For long- or short-term stays!
Available: June 1 through negotiable
About the room:
100 square feet, furnished with a full bed and a dresser. No closet, but  a=
 large
west-facing window that lets gorgeous sunlight in all day. Your  portion of=
 the=20
rent includes your share of internet, electric, and gas.  It is available f=
or summer
sublet or for long-term stays if we all mesh  well together. Rent/bills is =
$930/month
or $240/week. We would like a  one month or one week deposit depending on y=
our length
of stay.
About the Apartment:
We are located close to the Carroll or newly reopened Smith/9th F/G  stops,=
 each
 about a 10 minute walk. We're also really close to all the  restaurants an=
d shops
on van brunt street. The building was renovated 2  years ago and is still i=
n great
shape: all brand new stainless steel  appliances in the kitchen, (including=
 a dishwasher!),
and our bathroom  has a huge glass shower with separate bath tub. We are on=
 the=20
ground  floor and have a private 150 square foot deck with a fire place out=
  back.
All of the rooms also have central A/C and heat which is  individually cont=
rolled
with remotes. (Fancy!) The 3rd room is the most  private of the 3, with no =
shared
walls to other bedrooms or the common  space.
About us:
We are two 26-year old females. One is a writer/performer/chef working  in =
restaurants.
Originally from Seattle, who likes bike riding, comedy,  and cooking, and h=
as lived
in NYC for 8 years. The other is originally  from Northern California and h=
as lived
in NYC on and off for 6 years.  She's a teaching artist working in retail a=
nd in
 after school  programming, interested in theater, singing, and playing mus=
ic. Together
 we run a monthly supper club out of the apartment and keep a vegetarian  k=
itchen.
About you:
You have a steady source of income and can reliably pay rent on time.  You =
keep=20
your room in whatever condition you like, but are considerate  and tidy in =
common
spaces. You buy toilet paper and other common  household things like toothp=
aste=20
or paper towels or ice cream from time  to time because we all look out for=
 one=20
another. You take out the trash  or sweep the floors or empty the dishwashe=
r when
it needs to be done,  just because it needs to be done sometimes, not becau=
se it's
someone's  "turn." You don't smoke or have pets because we have allergies b=
ut you
 do like to look at dogs on the internet. You'll occasionally stay in to  u=
nwind
 with us over a glass of wine or two, but you have a life and  friends in t=
he city
that keeps you out and about as well.

$1500 per month, Greenpoint, 1560 sq ft, Two amazing rooms open this choice=
 modern
apartment
Available: June 1, 2013 through July 1, 2014
The apartment:
This apartment rocks.  It is a newly renovated apartment on the third  floo=
r of=20
a newly renovated, modern building.  Hardwood floors, washer  and dryer, di=
shwasher,
deep bathtub, gas stove, high-speed internet, and  an amazing 2,250 sq ft t=
ranslucent
COVERED PORCH.  There are two  skylights (in the kitchen and the hallway) a=
nd overall
it is a clean,  light-filled apartment with a modern, almost Japanese aesth=
etic,
 filled  with Ikea furniture and lovely attention to detail.  The building =
is  quite
safe.  The owners, who have a young family, live on the first  floor, and a=
lso designed
the building.  There is a security camera on  the front door, video door in=
tercom,
and we are backed with an old folks  home and trees in the back yard.
The rooms:
$1,500:  1,560 square feet.  Two south-facing windows opens to the  street,=
 which
is a quiet street, and has trees (and often birds) in its  view.  Closet sp=
ace is
ample (about 220 sq feet), and there is a  non-working fireplace in the roo=
m.  Ceilings
are very high (from 10.5  feet up to 13.5 feet, it slants up).  Can come fu=
rnished
with a bed,  dresser, desk and/or lamps, if you wish.
$1,100:  770 square feet.  Window faces the backyard.  Quiet, except for  t=
he birds
and the occasional Mariachi band in the neighbors backyard.   There is no c=
loset,
so you would probably want to get a standing  wardrobe for hanging clothes =
(they
 are about $80 at Ikea, or up from  there).  Comes with a single futon fold=
-out=20
bed, desk, lamps and/or  dresser, if you wish.
The neighborhood:
In case you don't know, north Greenpoint is the best neighborhood in the ci=
ty. =20
Here is why:
Transportation:
The apartment is about 5 blocks from the Greenpoint Avenue stop on the G  t=
rain.
  If you work in midtown (as I do), the commute is about 30  minutes.  It i=
s about
the same or less to anywhere on the L train in  Manhattan.
The apartment is also about 5 blocks from the Greenpoint Ferry that  stops =
on the
India street pier.  The Ferry is probably the coolest (and  quickest) way t=
o commute,
if you happen to work along its stops.  The  Pier itself is amazing, one of=
 the=20
best views of the city that there is  anywhere.  Seriously.
Greenpoint:
Great restaurants, bars, coffee shops, vintage shops, galleries, rooftop  g=
ardens,
yoga studios, the Y, co-working spaces...  not super-crowded,  and also all=
 surrounded
by the charm of the deeply Polish neighborhood  roots of Greenpoint.   You =
can walk
to the water or to McCarren Park  (and its pool in the summer), Transistor =
Park,
 and a lot more.  I love  it here, and I'm sure you will, too.
Me:
I have been living in this apartment for a year with a good friend who  is =
re-locating.
 I am an acupuncturist/massage therapist and  entrepreneur in the health an=
d wellness
field.  I work a lot, and often  from home (about half time).  I have a gir=
lfriend
who is here often,  though doesn't live here.  I like to keep a clean livin=
g environment,
I  cook at least once a week (I am trying to do so more!), and I am a great=
  guy
 to live with (if I may humbly say so myself).
You:
Reliable, fun, straightforward, creative type.  Y'know, ideal in every way =
and yet
easygoing :)
Next Steps:
Contact me and set up a time to come by and see the place, meet me, and  ta=
ke it
 from there.  Security and first and last month is required.  You  may have=
 to put
your name on the lease, which we can discuss.

$950 per month, bushwick, 2,000 sq ft, 15x16ft ft room in 5 bedroom huge ar=
tist=20
loft available.
Available: june 1st
We live off the morgan L train stop in a HUGE first floor of an old  apartm=
ent building.
The first 1,000 sq ft is victorian tin ceilings with  checker pattern floor=
ing,=20
the second 1,000 sq ft is all industrial  white brick with sky lights. The =
place
 has charm to say the least
We snug right nere grocery stores, laundromats and anything you could  poss=
ibly=20
need. The area is awesome and our neighbors are amazing, the  the two floor=
s above
our apartment everyone is friendly and knows one  another.
The room is 15 x 16 ft with 11 ft ceilings, theres a huge loft already  bui=
lt in
 that accompanies a queen sized mattress. Perfect space for  someone doing =
large
 projects as it's the second largest room in the  whole apartment. It sadly=
 however
does not have windows, though it does  have two huge glass window double do=
ors and
a natural light cut out that  is right next to one the sky lights so its no=
t your
average no window  space, as it is not terrifying or claustrophobic!
Their are 4 humans currently and 3 cats. The cats will want to rub up on  y=
our face
and be your best friend. If you are allergic to cats or hate  cats then thi=
s seriously
isn't the place for you, they smell discontent!

$1500 per month, Chelsea, Room is 216 sq. ft., With Two Huge Windows, Firep=

 & Exposed Brick Available
Available: 6/1/2013 through 07/01/2014
It's my favorite place I've ever lived - a 2 bedroom with a HUGE living  ro=
om that
we use as a third bedroom. I'm looking for someone to live in  that room. I=
t has
 two almost floor to ceiling windows, a fireplace,  exposed brick and a man=
tle on
one side.There's enough room for a queen  size bed, a full work desk, and a=
 separate
seating area just in the room  alone.
The common space is great with a newly renovated kitchen and plenty of  cou=
nter=20
space. A small dining area that we can fit about six people  around complet=
es it.
There's 1 full bath, a dish washer, and a full size  washer/dryer in the ap=
artment
as well. There's an unfinished roof that  has amazing views of the Empire S=
tate=20
Building, Chrysler Building,  Freedom Tower, and Google.
The location is amazing - 2 blocks from the 16th st. entrance to the  14th =
st. ACE/L
stop and 1 ave from the 18th st. 1 train. There's also a  bike lane and we'=
re in
 walking distance of every Chelsea gallery,  Printed Matter, The Highline, =
Chelsea
market, Meatpacking, and the West  Village. It's also a $5 cab ride to Port=
 Authority
or Penn Station which  is nice if you travel as much as I do.
Room mates are me (26, work at a news/tech startup w reg. hours,  @thebeff)=
 & Wendy
(24, analog/digital photographer, my bff). We are  creative, love music, th=
row shows,
fun friendly (but respectful), and  probably have about 2 dance parties a y=
ear.=20
We're both clean (though not  obsessively so), and enjoy substantive debate=
s on=20
a broad range of  topics + Netflix.
Rent is $1500/month + reasonable utilities. It's a serious deal for the  ar=
ea. Looking
for a June 1 move in, but would be flexible up to July 1.

$1400 per month, Clinton Hill/Bedstuy, 650 sq feet, Room w/Office Space ava=

Available: 06/1/2013
Hello,
I'm subletting a small bedroom and an office space area in my apartment  in=
 Clinton
Hill/Bed Stuy 5 minutes to Bedford-Nostrand G train stop. The  apartment ge=
ts lots
of sun light and there's a backyard and basement  for storage. There are pl=
enty=20
of great places to get food and coffee in  the hood, and tons of stuff on M=
yrtle
 ave and about 15 minute walk to  the heart of Clinton Hill.
I'm looking for a steadily employed woman or man late 20s-early 30s to  sha=
re this
place for the next few months. When I move out of the  apartment you could =
very=20
well take over the lease. About me: I'm 35 year  old male, work in media in=
 midtown
Manhattan, quiet, respectful, and  try to keep a clean place. If you're a r=
easonable
human being, not into  drugs, steadily employed, please message me.
To move in you'll need first month and security.
Depending on how long you'd like to stay and if we're compatible, it is  po=
ssible
to throw up a wall in the living so that the living room is  turned into a =
new bedroom
for you. There is also a space that can  function as an office. Once you st=
op by
 and see the place, it'll be  easier to explain.

$800 per month, Crown Heights / Prospect Heights, 6.5' x 8.9',  Incredible =
light,
large common areas & kitchen, terrific  neighborhood
Available: 5/27/13
Two filmmakers who just moved into a recently renovated apt. on the  border=
 of Crown
Heights / Prospect Heights are looking for a third  roommate for our--in ou=
r humble
opinion--amazing new place. The room  itself is small: 6.5' by 8.9'. There =
are,=20
however, two quite large  common areas right next to the room and a large k=
itchen
and bathroom. We  would be amenable to potentially putting a chest of drawe=
rs or
 armoire  out in the common area since there is no closet in the room. Ther=
e is=20
a  south-facing window in the room, though, and the apartment itself, a  fl=
oor-through
with no buildings adjacent to it, gets incredible light  from all four side=
s.
We are two friendly filmmakers in our 30's who work freelance. We're  prett=
y quiet
and respectful of others privacy, although we do like to  have the occasion=
al social
gathering. You would most likely be someone  who is also pretty quiet, resp=
ectful,
and friendly. You would also most  likely be someone who doesn't have a ton=
 of stuff
since the room just  isn't that large.
Rent is $800 a month plus utilities which would mainly be internet and  ele=
ctricity
since heat is included. Landlord is very cool-an architect  who recently re=
novated
the apt. himself and lives in the neighborhood.
The Neighborhood itself is fantastic. Cool shops, bars, and restaurants  ri=
ght around
the corner, the 2,3,4,5 a block away, and Prospect Park,  the Brooklyn Muse=
um, and
the Botanical Gardens only a few blocks away.
Restrictions: No pets and no smoking in the apt.-landlord's rules.
We just moved in and have yet to do much decorating so the photos do not  g=
ive a
 completely accurate representation of what the space will  ultimately look=
 like

$970 per month, Greenpoint, 15 x 7 feet, Room available in an amazing 2 bed=
room=20
Greenpoint apartment.
Available: 6/15
My current roommate is about to embark on an extended trip around the  worl=
d (lucky
freelancers!) and is flexible to move out any time between  6/15 and 7/1.
The apartment is the entire second floor of a three story house. There  is =
a large
living room, an eat in kitchen with tons of cabinets and  counter space, an=
d plenty
of closet/storage space. There are windows in  every room. I have lived her=
e for
 two and a half years and couldn't  imagine living anywhere else in the cit=
y. Though
I have been in the  apartment for a while, there is still plenty of room fo=
r you
 to add to  the common spaces - I am open to painting, incorporating your f=
urniture,
 rearranging, etc.
Located on a super quiet residential street in the best neighborhood in  NY=
C, less
than a block away from two amazing bakeries. You can buy fresh  baked bread=
 for=20
a little over a dollar and your walk home always smells  delicious. A short=
 walk
 to both McGolrick and McCarren Park, as well as  plenty of cafes, restaura=
nts,=20
bars, and other conveniences.
The G train at Nassau is about a 5 minute walk and it is about a mile  walk=
 to the
L train at Bedford, Lorimer, or Graham. I usually walk to  the L every day =
to commute
to work in the east village, but it is also  easy to connect with the G or =
via the
B62, B48, and B43 busses - all  which run regularly.
The bedroom is a nice size. It has a window and enough space for a queen  s=
ize bed,
a large desk, a bookshelf and some other furniture. There is  also a bowlin=
g alley
sized hallway right outside of the room that you  are welcome to use for an=
y other
furniture you don't want to keep in  your room such as a bookshelf or extra=
 dresser.
There is a very large  closet right outside (though not actually in the roo=
m).
A bit about me:
I am a 32 year old female working for a non profit public arts  organizatio=
n in=20
Manhattan. Between work, events, independent projects,  and catching up wit=
h friends,
I am rarely home. However, when I am I  love to cook and relax with a glass=
 of wine
and a movie. I am looking  for a friendly roommate relationship - someone w=
ho I=20
can have a drink  and conversation with when we are both home. I am open to=
 male
 or  female, late 20's through late 30's would likely be the best fit, but =
I  am
 open.
I love cats, but unfortunately am slightly allergic. A small to medium  siz=
e dog
 would be great though - I would even help walking it!

block, close to all of the new shopping and dining  hot-spots in the neighb=
orhood.
The third floor (about 1000 sq ft) would  be all yours and includes a HUGE =
bedroom,
bathroom and laundry, plus a  large living room/study with a kitchenette. Y=
ou would
share a gourmet  kitchen on the Parlor Floor with me and would also have fu=
ll access
to  the deck and backyard. I've repeatedly been told the kitchen looks like=
  something
out of a magazine, but it handled my first-ever Thanksgiving  dinner for 22=
 people
like a pro.
The 1896 house was gut renovated, keeping as much of the original period  d=
etails
as could be salvaged; what couldn't be saved I tried to  recreate in a thou=
ghtful
way. There are walnut floors throughout, marble  and granite counters, gas =
and decorative
fireplaces, central &  zoned heat/ac, video intercom and a security system,=
 plus
 cable and  wifi.
The B/C & 2/3 subways are just a couple of blocks away and the M2, M7 and M=
102 buses
are practically on the corner.
About me:
I'm the owner/house renovator (well, the contractor & his crew did  the hea=
vy lifting,
but I oversaw every sq inch of the project!) I work  for an international n=
on-profit
where I put in fairly long hours and  travel frequently for work. I'm prett=
y laidback
and a bit of a homebody  these days either relaxing in my glorious new home=
 or working
in the  garden. I love good food and better wine. I don't entertain that mu=
ch, =20
but I love to throw a good dinner party and cook for family and friends.  I=
'm not
OCD, but I prefer to live in a clean, tidy space and would  expect the same=
 from
 a roommate. (okay, when it comes to the carrara  marble counters I'm a lit=
tle OCD...)
I'm happy to share the cost of a  cleaning person or service if you prefer.
I'm looking for a financially responsible, quiet and respectful person to s=
hare=20
my house with.
No pets. No smoking. No drugs. No couples.
1st month and 1 month deposit required along with references. Utilities and=
 cable
are shared.
If you're interested, email me and we can arrange a tour of the space. Plea=
se be
 sure to include some details about yourself.

$2000 total ($1000/month due on the 1st)
+ Utilities/Internet/Cable - we split 3 ways (last year June was $87)
We have an A/C but it's been so chilly we haven't installed it yet.
No smoking in apt, but there is a fire escape that you can go on.
The room is a middle size bedroom with high ceiling and a fan. There is a  =
full=20

which
 I could easily make available. There's a lot of natural  daylight which is=

My bedroom is off the living room. We all share, and enjoy the common  spac=
es. There
is a couch and a daybed in the living room, an office,  kitchen, dining roo=
m. There
room is off the dinning room, so at the  opposite end of the apartment.

 share
yours with only one other person.
Wireless internet access, central AC, and washer/drier. We can provide bedd=

periods, and the revenue from this arrangement usually  covers all utilitie=

une 3rd
through July 31st. It is located on the second floor  of a warehouse-conver=
ted building.
I am listing it at $925 for a full  month or else $235/week. This includes =
utilities
and internet. In  addition there is a security deposit.
Ridgewood is a truly down to earth neighborhood on the frontier between  Br=
ooklyn
and Queens with a lively mix of immigrants, long-time locals  and young cre=
ative
 types. The building is relatively new and my place is  fully furnished wit=
h a lot
of light in the room, working desk, single  bed and HDTV monitor. Wake-up t=
o occasional
chirping birds, friendly  neighbors, big rooftop perfect for stargazing, an=
d in-building
laundry  (!).There isn't a lot of storage space, so please take that into  =
consideration.
There is a yoga+zumba+krav maga studio a block away  (brownie points) in ad=
dition
to a large neighborhood park. 8-10 min walk  to either the M at Seneca or L=
 at Dekalb
and the train ride takes you  into Manhattan within 20 min and Bushwick and=
 Williamsburg
are right  next door. You get the best of both worlds: close access to the =
hustle
 'n bustle of Manhattan and a low key place to get a sound night of  sleep.=
 Can't
get any better! Please get in touch if this is of interest  to you!
Ideally, I am looking for someone to take the place for 2 months.  However,=
 I can
also be open to you staying for one-month. Negotiable.  You will be living =
with=20
a super clean roommate and must be  queer-friendly, clean up after yourself=
, and
 not bring the party home.  There is no smoking, nor pets, allowed in the a=
partment.
If this is what you are looking for, please get in touch. i would love to m=
eet you!

New Paltz/ Woodstock area, $1000 per month, Upstate Catskills, 3 BR  house =
on 2=20
acres with stream, surrounded by forest. Share with mostly  absent owner/ar=
tist
Available: June 1, 2013
Nestled in the Catskill Mountains just 2 hrs north of the GWB, an oasis  of=
 quiet,
fresh air and wild life. Ideal for artists, writers and other  creative peo=
ple who
want to focus on their projects without the usual  distractions. 1200 sf 3 =
BR house
with detached workshop gives ample  space for your craft and your mind. Lar=
ge living
room with open kitchen,  tastefully decorated with art and Tibetan rugs, pl=
us art/work
space,  your bedroom and full bathroom downstairs. My bedroom and guest bed=
room=20
 upstairs. This cozy 2 story house with cathedral ceilings, 1.5 bath, and  =
a great
wood stove that keeps the house comfortable during the cold  months, looks =
out on
a meandering stream that crosses the property.
This rental is intended for a single person, but I am open to discuss the p=
ossibility
of sharing with a couple.
We can discuss what would be the best arrangement for both of us.
One option could be where you basically have the house all to yourself,  ex=
cept=20
for two weekends a month when I will use the house exclusively.  That obvio=
usly=20
would not work if you are planning to move into the house  full-time. Unles=
s you
 can be flexible about these two weekends.
Another option could be where on average 6 days a week you have the  place =
all to
your self. I would come up from NYC about once a week to  stay for a day ( =
2 nights
usually). Holidays can be discussed.
If you can be okay with any of the above arrangements, this might be a  gre=
at deal
for you. I prefer more prolonged commitments (6+ months ) but  will conside=
r shorter
rentals. Non-smokers only.
You can check the house out on the somewhat dated house website www.catskil=
lrentalhouse.com
We are planning to install a washer/dryer in the next 6 months. And a  bath=
house
 with sauna-room next to the stream in the next 12 months or  so.
If you're wondering what kind of art I'm involved with you can see and  hea=
r some
of that on my website: www.marcelvanrootselaar.com
Rent $1000/month plus utilities. $2500 security deposit plus references.
Local Transportation: Buses to New Paltz or Kingston, local cab. Or drive u=
p yourself

The apartment is located on 1st Avenue between 58th and 59th Streets in  Ma=
nhattan

lings
 (9'-5"), hardwood floors, and a decorative archway.  It gets lots of morni=
ng sun
(East exposure), has two ceiling fans, a  window AC unit, and two closets f=
or storage.
The superintendent lives on  premises, and there is an elevator in the buil=
ding.
The apartment is rent stabilized. We are currently paying $1706 and  antici=
pate=20
that the rent will increase by 18% since it is rent  stabilized and up to 1=
8% increase
is allowable with initiation of a new  lease.
THE NEIGHBORHOOD
The location is amazing!! Just two blocks away from the 3rd Avenue  entranc=
e to=20

WHY WE ARE LISTING THE APARTMENT
We are a recently married couple that need a little more space to  spread o=
ut. We
started our search a bit early and found an apartment  before our lease is =
up on
 September 1st. If we find a tenant to initiate  a new year one lease, the =
owner
 will release us from our lease early  without penalty. We found this apart=
ment=20
almost two years ago and it was  a great deal. We would like to share this =
opportunity
with someone who  may be looking to move in by June 1st and initiate a one =
year=20
lease.
CONTACT
If interested in more information or viewing the apartment, please send  an=
 email.
Someone will contact you back quickly. Serious inquiries  only!

$800 per week, Little Italy, One bedroom, Sunny lovely one bedroom in terri=
fic Manhattan
location!
Available: June 8 through ??
Hello,
The price may be negotiable depending on how long the stay is :)
I had to put a price so I set it at $820/week since it's a really fair  pri=
ce. But
I prefer someone there for longer and we can talk about the  rate.
My apartment is a spacious New York style 1-bedroom. It has five large  win=
dows=20
-- its a bright and happy place - and it's on the third floor of  a pre-war=
 building.
(No elevator.) Located on the border of Little  Italy and Soho, the apartme=
nt is
 perfectly placed in the center of the  city, only a few blocks from Chinat=
own,=20
Nolita, TriBeCa, and the Lower  East Side, and the East Village is a 15-min=
ute walk
away.
The neighborhood is filled with excellent restaurants, bars, shops and  bou=
tiques,
and there are several subways (6/N/Q/B/D/J/M/Z) and a parking  lot all very=
 close.
I will leave behind suggestions for places to eat  and drink as well as use=
ful things
like pharmacies and grocery stores.
Towels and bedding and mattress are all new and freshly cleaned. Wifi is  w=
ireless.
The fridge is spacious and there are kitchen utensils and  cookware.
This is really super important: I'm looking for someone mature, quiet,  res=
ponsible
and discreet. This is NOT a social or party situation and  therefore perhap=
s not
 the most desirable situation for a young student  or someone who would lik=
e to=20
bring the party home... sorry to sound so  boring! But it's essential my ne=
ighbors
are undisturbed and there is  absolutely no noise or drama.
The apartment works for couples, though I much prefer a single/solo person.
Please only non-smokers. I love smokers, but not the smoking.
If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to contact me. I a=
m always
available. Thank you!

$65 per day, Central Harlem, 800, Cozy Sublet
Available: June 11 through July 3
Hi, I am a bit of a regular on Stephanie's list, and have always been  than=
kful=20
for the wonderful people her project has sent me to rent my  lovely furnish=
ed apartment.
For this time around I will be going away for 8 weeks to Boston for a  resi=
dency
 and am looking for a quiet, clean and respectful roommate for a  short ter=
m sublet
that has the potential to become a longer term  rental.
From June 11 - 29 I will be renting out my furnished bedroom at $65 a  day.=
 It is
the smaller bedroom of a real 800 sq ft two bedroom apartment  in a brand n=
ew elevator
building. The larger master bedroom is  currently being rented by a young a=
ctress
from Spain until June 29.  After she leaves the, the larger room will be av=
ailable
until July 3  after which the whole place will be full until August 1. Afte=
r August
 1st I am looking for new roommates to rent both the smaller room until  Au=
gust=20
11 and the larger master bedroom for long term at $1,300 a month.
Ok, so I know this sounds rather complicated, but if you are intrigued  let=
s start
a conversation to see what we can work out. You can read some  great review=
s of=20
my place through airbnb at  https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17716
The rent includes all utilities and internet, shared bathroom and a  fully =
stocked
kitchen (tend to try to keep it close to vegetarian with  just chicken or f=
ish.)
 Both rooms are furnished with a bed, chairs,  storage shelves, a closet, s=
heets,
towels and blankets. My smaller room  has a murphy bed that can be raised t=
o allow
space for working at a desk  or practicing yoga. The Master bedroom has a b=
ed that
can fold up into a  couch, a desk, a few smaller tables and a wonderful ant=
ique=20
dining  table for eating in.
While I am away the living room will be available to share with a dining  t=
able,
 desks and couch. When I return in August I use the living room  as my offi=
ce/studio
when I work at home.
I am on the second floor facing north on a quiet residential street with  t=
ree top
views, AC, WiFi, hard wood floors and good clean neighbors,  very safe. Ala=
s there
is no laundry in the building, but plenty of  Laundromats around the corner=
, as=20
well as 2 major subway stops, nice  supermarket and lots of cool restaurant=
s and
 bars nearby. The best part  is only being 2 blocks north of Central Park!

HOUSES FOR SALE

Stowe, $169,000, Vermont, 1,300 sq. feet plus an unheated  barn, Great deal=
 in the
village of Stowe, VT, 1850 house with barn  (future studio)
Available: now
My brother and I just lowered the price on our family house to $169,000  (t=
ax assessed
value is $194,000). I am incredulous that this investment  opportunity hasn=
't been
snapped up already, but we listed it just as  winter was coming on - not th=
e best
time for house sales.
Naturally I am writing this in effort to sell fast, and am completely  bias=
ed, BUT
it really is a great deal! A historic Victorian on Stowe  village property,=
 =BD acre
lot with lovely woods behind it. Our bedroom  window just below the gingerb=
read=20
roof peak (seen in second photo) has a  view of Mt. Mansfield (the living r=
oom window
used to, but some trees  have grown in the way). My brother and I walked to=
 school
everyday to  what is now Helen Day Art Center, so the house is about =BD mi=
le from
 the  village center. My mother lived in the house from 1957 until a month =
 before
she died last August.
What are the negatives? Although you could live there right away as my  mot=
her did
- everything works fine - most Stowe-ites would want to  renovate EVERYTHIN=
G. For
instance, there is no shower in the bathroom,  simply an old clawfoot tub. =
One could
easily put $100,000 into the place  and have the greatest up-to-date interi=
or within
a charming historic  exterior on a big lot with woods to explore AND an eas=
y walk
to the  village. This isn't a challenge for everyone, but a great investmen=
t for
  those who see the value of a Stowe property. According to our realtor,  t=
he other
negative for most people is that there is a shared driveway.  All I can say=
 is we've
never had a problem with the right of way, and  there is room for expansion=
. Because
it's in a historic district, you  can add on, but cannot tear the house dow=
n.
Ask me any questions,

Hello there,

I can pay a deposit as well.
A little about me: I'm mid-thirties and work in film and video. I'm  really=
 easy
 going yet tidy. And of course, respectful of others,  financially stable a=
nd punctual
when it comes to paying rent and bills.  I'm into music, film, reading actu=
al books
on paper, eating good  barbecue, biking and sometimes even "cycling", campi=
ng, fishing
and  Brooklyn summers and Brooklyn winters.
Thanks and looking forward to hearing from you.

$1200 per month, Brooklyn, Creator of worst room on Craigs list for Tumblr
Available: ASAP through Long Term
My name is Ryan and I am 25-year-old male looking for a new place to  call =
home=20
in Brooklyn. I have been looking for quite some time now  without much luck=
. I made
a blog about my experiences looking on  Craigslist: http://theworstroom.tum=
blr.com
Anyways,  I have good credit, proof of solid income, good references,  etc.=
.. My
 budget is a maximum of 1200.00 per month. I am looking to live  in Ditmas =
Park,
 Park Slope, Carroll Gardens, Greenpoint, Clinton Hill,  Bed-Stuy, Cobble H=
ill,=20
Brooklyn Heights or Fort Greene.
I am a positive, considerate person, a cinematographer and filmmaker,  reco=
rd collector,
avid cyclist, gardener, composter, homebrewer,  environmentally conscious g=
uy. I
 have lived in large community settings  with families as well as smaller s=
ituations.
I am originally from Kentucky and now I'm living/working in New York as a f=
reelance
cinematographer.
I grew up gardening and I'd love to keep doing so. My last house had  chick=
ens in
the front yard. If your place has a backyard or frontyard  that I can poten=
tially
garden and/or have chickens in that is a HUGE  PLUS, but not a dealbreaker.
I am a member of the Park Slope Food Co-Op and I have a car (which makes br=
inging
home groceries much easier!)
I love all kinds of music and I'm willing to share what I have to listen  t=
o. I=20
have a somewhat large record collection that always seems to be  growing.
I am an avid hiker/backpacker and love trying to summit very tall mountains=
 (and
 shorter ones).
Please email me or give me a call at 270.307.5163 if you think I'd be a  go=
od fit
in your place. We can work out a time for me to come see the  space. My sch=
edule
 is fairly flexible.
kindly,
Ryan
P.S. I have my uncle's HBOGO password...

Hello Listers!!

Nanny by day), and He's an Actor/Photographer (and Barista  by day).  After=
 six=20

 own.
We would love a spacious apartment in a safe neighborhood (a short walk  fr=
om any
trains), and preferably one that provides a nearby greenspace  for our dog,=
 Awesome.
 He is a well-trained, extremely well behaved pet  with nothing but love fo=
r everyone
he meets.  An extra room to use as a  studio space would be amazing, but no=
t necessary.
 Our budget is  1200-1500, and our move date is July 1st (with some flexibl=
ity).
  We  would love a place to call home for a long-term commitment.
Thanks so much!!

 usually quietly plugging away at some editing  project. I'm very clean, re=

I'm looking for an available room with a window, and I have a soft spot  fo=

 Brooklyn buildings with tons of character. I'm hoping to find a  place to =
stay=20
at least one year. In addition to most Brooklyn  neighborhoods I'm also int=

Brand Identity / Visual Design Opportunity, Help Us Reimagine Belonging - a=
 transmedia
endeavor
Date: As soon as possible
The project is an outgrowth of a documentary film project "with WINGS  and =
ROOTS"
which features the stories of children of immigrants in  Berlin and New Yor=
k pushing
the definitions of belonging in their  artwork and activism. There are 2 sh=
ort films
which have won several  awards and have screened over 100 times in the US a=
nd Europe.
The  overall transmedia project includes films, online interactive tools, a=
nd  educational
products.
There is a modest budget for the design/brand work, and we are looking  to =
work=20
with someone talented, professional, and passionate about the  project. As =
a project
undertaken on voluntary labor, we hope to find  someone willing to work at =
potentially
discounted ratio, but are willing  to pay for the right person.

00 per month, Williamsburg, 7x15 ft, Room Available in light, beautiful bro=
wnstone apartment in South Williamsburg<br /> Available: 6/1/13 through 12/=
1/13<br /><br /> Hi! We are two 27 year old girls, Australian and Brazilian=
, and we have a  spare room in our South Williamsburg place on South Fifth =
Street. It is  2 blocks from the JMZ Macy Ave stop (in Manhattan in 5 mins!=
) and a  short ten minute walk to the L train. The neighbourhood is awesome=
,  close to everything but still has original charm! And is very close to  =
some great bars and restaurants like Diner, Marlow & Sons, The  Lighthouse,=
 Fatty Cue etc.<br /> <br /> The room is in the back of the house and looks=
 out to the building's  back garden (we are both up the front), there is a =
big window, a  built-in cupboard, floorboards and it is long rather than wi=
de! 7 feet  by 15 ft approximately.<br /> The living space is big and open.=
 <br /> We are on the first floor and our street is leafy and pretty quiet.=
  There is a great supermarket (Mr Pina) a couple of blocks away and loads =
 of laundromats etc.<br /> <br /> We are good friends and are both study Li=
ghting Design and Interior Arch  at Parsons. We're super busy during semest=
er however we start summer  break in a week and will be at home more than u=
sual.<br /> We moved in a month ago and have started setting up the place b=
ut you can be part of creating our new home! <br /> <br /> We are clean and=
 pretty quiet (apart from playing music). We are looking  for someone who i=
s warm and open and a respectful housemate. While we  are not uptight pleas=
e don't apply if you are not clean and unable to do  housework!<br /> Also,=
 we have put down that it is available for 6 months but if it is working ou=
t well it can definitely be more long term.<br /> <br /> Please get in touc=
h if you are interested. Write us an email and tell us about yourself. <br =
/> <br /> Thanks and look forward to meeting you!!<br /><br /> <a style=3D"=

rent starting June 1 for one individual in Greenpoint, Brooklyn<br /> - $11=
00 utilities and Internet included ($30 additional for air conditioner use)=
<br /> - Non-smokers please<br /> - 420 friendly to a reasonable degree<br =
/> - No pets please<br /> <br /> Greenpoint is one of the safest, quietest,=
 quaintest, prettiest and most  convenient neighborhoods the city has to of=
fer. Five blocks away you  have the East River Ferry, which for four dollar=
s will shuttle you  directly to Midtown (as well as Williamsburg, Dumbo and=
 Governor's  Island). The G train is less than a 5-minute walk from the loc=
ation and  connections can be made to the L, E, M and 7 trains. All trains =
are  within walking distance. McCarren Park is close by with a large green =
 space, playgrounds, track and a Farmer's Market on Saturdays. If you  have=
 a car, parking is relatively easy to find in the neighborhood.  Regular al=
ternative side of the street parking rules apply.<br /> <br /> I am seeking=
 a professional or student who is neat and who understands  the importance =
of cleaning up immediately after making a mess (mainly in  the kitchen area=
) and also has no problem sharing the cleaning  responsibilities in the ent=
ire household. I am searching for a person  who has an active work/school l=
ife, does not spend a lot of time in the  apartment and can keep noise to a=
 minimum during nighttime hours.  Weekends, of course, are a different stor=
y.<br /> <br /> About the apartment:<br /> Two bedrooms and a small bathroo=
m with shelving space available. The  kitchen has all the necessary appoint=
ments and a small kitchen table  that seats 4. There is a patio area that I=
 am planning to turn into a  brunch nook but that is still in the works so =
if you have any  suggestions as to how this area can be decorated I am open=
 to hear them  and do a joint project. The living room has a sofa bed for g=
uests, a TV  with a DVD player but no cable (I do not plan on getting cable=
 ever),  and my desk. <br /> <br /> The room for rent has space for a twin =
or full size bed as well as a  stand alone closet and shelving. You have th=
e option to paint the room  if you do not like the color. Supplies and labo=
r are your responsibility  although I would be happy to help. <br /> <br />=
 A little about your potential roommate:<br /> I am a professional and I wo=
rk primarily from home. I occasionally have  guests over but I would rather=
 have my social time outside of the house.  I enjoy being social with the p=
erson I am living with although it is  not necessary that we are all in eac=
h others' business. I think it is  important to be cordial and friendly wit=
h the people I live with because  I thoroughly appreciate a stress free liv=
ing environment. I am a firm  believer in communication so, if there is an =
issue that involves me or  the household, a respectful an non combative dis=
cussion needs to happen.  I like to make costumes as a hobby and you will s=
ee me furiously sewing  away on occasion. Dancing is my favorite pastime an=
d I frequently go  and shake my booty with my people. I like to hoop on occ=
asion and I have  two hoops that I tote around with me. <br /> <br /> If yo=
u are interested or want to learn more please respond to this post! <br /> =
Couples ARE welcome for an additional monthly fee of $300. Thank you!<br />=

 two 26-year old females. One is a writer/performer/chef working  in restau=

, and has lived in NYC for 8 years. The other is originally  from Northern =
California and has lived in NYC on and off for 6 years.  She's a teaching a=
rtist working in retail and in after school  programming, interested in the=
ater, singing, and playing music. Together  we run a monthly supper club ou=
t of the apartment and keep a vegetarian  kitchen.<br /> <br /> About you:<=
br /> You have a steady source of income and can reliably pay rent on time.=
  You keep your room in whatever condition you like, but are considerate  a=
nd tidy in common spaces. You buy toilet paper and other common  household =
things like toothpaste or paper towels or ice cream from time  to time beca=
use we all look out for one another. You take out the trash  or sweep the f=
loors or empty the dishwasher when it needs to be done,  just because it ne=
eds to be done sometimes, not because it's someone's  "turn." You don't smo=
ke or have pets because we have allergies but you  do like to look at dogs =
on the internet. You'll occasionally stay in to  unwind with us over a glas=
s of wine or two, but you have a life and  friends in the city that keeps y=
ou out and about as well.<br /><br /> Local Transportation: Carroll st or S=

00 per month, Greenpoint, 1560 sq ft, Two amazing rooms open this choice mo=
dern apartment<br /> Available: June 1, 2013 through July 1, 2014<br /><br =
/> The apartment:<br /> This apartment rocks.  It is a newly renovated apar=
tment on the third  floor of a newly renovated, modern building.  Hardwood =
floors, washer  and dryer, dishwasher, deep bathtub, gas stove, high-speed =
internet, and  an amazing 2,250 sq ft translucent COVERED PORCH.  There are=
 two  skylights (in the kitchen and the hallway) and overall it is a clean,=
  light-filled apartment with a modern, almost Japanese aesthetic, filled  =
with Ikea furniture and lovely attention to detail.  The building is  quite=
 safe.  The owners, who have a young family, live on the first  floor, and =
also designed the building.  There is a security camera on  the front door,=
 video door intercom, and we are backed with an old folks  home and trees i=
n the back yard.<br /> <br /> The rooms:<br /> $1,500:  1,560 square feet. =
 Two south-facing windows opens to the  street, which is a quiet street, an=
d has trees (and often birds) in its  view.  Closet space is ample (about 2=
20 sq feet), and there is a  non-working fireplace in the room.  Ceilings a=
re very high (from 10.5  feet up to 13.5 feet, it slants up).  Can come fur=
nished with a bed,  dresser, desk and/or lamps, if you wish.<br /> <br /> $=
1,100:  770 square feet.  Window faces the backyard.  Quiet, except for  th=
e birds and the occasional Mariachi band in the neighbors backyard.   There=
 is no closet, so you would probably want to get a standing  wardrobe for h=
anging clothes (they are about $80 at Ikea, or up from  there).  Comes with=
 a single futon fold-out bed, desk, lamps and/or  dresser, if you wish.<br =
/> <br /> The neighborhood:<br /> <br /> In case you don't know, north Gree=
npoint is the best neighborhood in the city.  Here is why:<br /> <br /> Tra=
nsportation:<br /> The apartment is about 5 blocks from the Greenpoint Aven=
ue stop on the G  train.  If you work in midtown (as I do), the commute is =
about 30  minutes.  It is about the same or less to anywhere on the L train=
 in  Manhattan.  <br /> <br /> The apartment is also about 5 blocks from th=
e Greenpoint Ferry that  stops on the India street pier.  The Ferry is prob=
ably the coolest (and  quickest) way to commute, if you happen to work alon=
g its stops.  The  Pier itself is amazing, one of the best views of the cit=
y that there is  anywhere.  Seriously.<br /> <br /> Greenpoint:<br /> Great=
 restaurants, bars, coffee shops, vintage shops, galleries, rooftop  garden=
s, yoga studios, the Y, co-working spaces...  not super-crowded,  and also =
all surrounded by the charm of the deeply Polish neighborhood  roots of Gre=
enpoint.   You can walk to the water or to McCarren Park  (and its pool in =
the summer), Transistor Park, and a lot more.  I love  it here, and I'm sur=
e you will, too.<br /> <br /> Me:<br /> I have been living in this apartmen=
t for a year with a good friend who  is re-locating.  I am an acupuncturist=
/massage therapist and  entrepreneur in the health and wellness field.  I w=
ork a lot, and often  from home (about half time).  I have a girlfriend who=
 is here often,  though doesn't live here.  I like to keep a clean living e=
nvironment, I  cook at least once a week (I am trying to do so more!), and =
I am a great  guy to live with (if I may humbly say so myself).<br /> <br /=
> You:<br /> Reliable, fun, straightforward, creative type.  Y'know, ideal =
in every way and yet easygoing :)<br /> <br /> Next Steps:<br /> Contact me=
 and set up a time to come by and see the place, meet me, and  take it from=
 there.  Security and first and last month is required.  You  may have to p=
ut your name on the lease, which we can discuss.<br /><br /> <a style=3D"co=

r /><br /> It's my favorite place I've ever lived - a 2 bedroom with a HUGE=
 living  room that we use as a third bedroom. I'm looking for someone to li=

 exposed brick and a mantle on one side.There's enough room for a queen  si=

nd plenty of  counter space. A small dining area that we can fit about six =
people  around completes it. There's 1 full bath, a dish washer, and a full=
 size  washer/dryer in the apartment as well. There's an unfinished roof th=
at  has amazing views of the Empire State Building, Chrysler Building,  Fre=

 st. 1 train. There's also a  bike lane and we're in walking distance of ev=

dance parties a year. We're both clean (though not  obsessively so), and en=

/27/13<br /><br /> Two filmmakers who just moved into a recently renovated =
apt. on the  border of Crown Heights / Prospect Heights are looking for a t=
hird  roommate for our--in our humble opinion--amazing new place. The room =
 itself is small: 6.5' by 8.9'. There are, however, two quite large  common=
 areas right next to the room and a large kitchen and bathroom. We  would b=
e amenable to potentially putting a chest of drawers or armoire  out in the=
 common area since there is no closet in the room. There is a  south-facing=
 window in the room, though, and the apartment itself, a  floor-through wit=
h no buildings adjacent to it, gets incredible light  from all four sides. =
<br /> <br /> We are two friendly filmmakers in our 30's who work freelance=
. We're  pretty quiet and respectful of others privacy, although we do like=
 to  have the occasional social gathering. You would most likely be someone=
  who is also pretty quiet, respectful, and friendly. You would also most  =
likely be someone who doesn't have a ton of stuff since the room just  isn'=
t that large. <br /> <br /> Rent is $800 a month plus utilities which would=
 mainly be internet and  electricity since heat is included. Landlord is ve=
ry cool-an architect  who recently renovated the apt. himself and lives in =
the neighborhood.<br /> <br /> The Neighborhood itself is fantastic. Cool s=
hops, bars, and restaurants  right around the corner, the 2,3,4,5 a block a=
way, and Prospect Park,  the Brooklyn Museum, and the Botanical Gardens onl=
y a few blocks away.<br /> <br /> Restrictions: No pets and no smoking in t=
he apt.-landlord's rules. <br /> <br /> We just moved in and have yet to do=
 much decorating so the photos do not  give a completely accurate represent=
ation of what the space will  ultimately look like<br /><br /> <a style=3D"=

 am open to painting, incorporating your furniture,  rearranging, etc. <br =

 The G train at Nassau is about a 5 minute walk and it is about a mile  wal=

very day to commute to work in the east village, but it is also  easy to co=
nnect with the G or via the B62, B48, and B43 busses - all  which run regul=
arly. <br /> <br /> The bedroom is a nice size. It has a window and enough =
space for a queen  size bed, a large desk, a bookshelf and some other furni=
ture. There is  also a bowling alley sized hallway right outside of the roo=
m that you  are welcome to use for any other furniture you don't want to ke=
ep in  your room such as a bookshelf or extra dresser. There is a very larg=

it about me:<br /> I am a 32 year old female working for a non profit publi=
c arts  organization in Manhattan. Between work, events, independent projec=
ts,  and catching up with friends, I am rarely home. However, when I am I  =
love to cook and relax with a glass of wine and a movie. I am looking  for =
a friendly roommate relationship - someone who I can have a drink  and conv=
ersation with when we are both home. I am open to male or  female, late 20'=
s through late 30's would likely be the best fit, but I  am open.<br /> <br=
 /> I love cats, but unfortunately am slightly allergic. A small to medium =
 size dog would be great though - I would even help walking it!<br /><br />=

m<br /><br /> About the space:<br /> This newly renovated 20' wide townhous=
e is in Central Harlem next to a  glorious gated community garden. The spac=
e is bright and airy and sits  on a quiet tree-lined block, close to all of=
 the new shopping and dining  hot-spots in the neighborhood. The third floo=
r (about 1000 sq ft) would  be all yours and includes a HUGE bedroom, bathr=
oom and laundry, plus a  large living room/study with a kitchenette. You wo=
uld share a gourmet  kitchen on the Parlor Floor with me and would also hav=
e full access to  the deck and backyard. I've repeatedly been told the kitc=
hen looks like  something out of a magazine, but it handled my first-ever T=
hanksgiving  dinner for 22 people like a pro. <br /> <br /> The 1896 house =
was gut renovated, keeping as much of the original period  details as could=
 be salvaged; what couldn't be saved I tried to  recreate in a thoughtful w=
ay. There are walnut floors throughout, marble  and granite counters, gas a=
nd decorative fireplaces, central &  zoned heat/ac, video intercom and a se=
curity system, plus cable and  wifi. <br /> <br /> The B/C & 2/3 subways ar=
e just a couple of blocks away and the M2, M7 and M102 buses are practicall=
y on the corner.<br /> <br /> About me:<br /> I'm the owner/house renovator=
 (well, the contractor & his crew did  the heavy lifting, but I oversaw eve=
ry sq inch of the project!) I work  for an international non-profit where I=
 put in fairly long hours and  travel frequently for work. I'm pretty laidb=
ack and a bit of a homebody  these days either relaxing in my glorious new =
home or working in the  garden. I love good food and better wine. I don't e=
ntertain that much,  but I love to throw a good dinner party and cook for f=
amily and friends.  I'm not OCD, but I prefer to live in a clean, tidy spac=
e and would  expect the same from a roommate. (okay, when it comes to the c=
arrara  marble counters I'm a little OCD...) I'm happy to share the cost of=
 a  cleaning person or service if you prefer.<br /> <br /> I'm looking for =
a financially responsible, quiet and respectful person to share my house wi=
th. <br /> No pets. No smoking. No drugs. No couples. <br /> <br /> 1st mon=
th and 1 month deposit required along with references. Utilities and cable =
are shared.<br /> <br /> If you're interested, email me and we can arrange =
a tour of the space. Please be sure to include some details about yourself.=

 internet. In  addition there is a security deposit.<br /> <br /> Ridgewood=
 is a truly down to earth neighborhood on the frontier between  Brooklyn an=
d Queens with a lively mix of immigrants, long-time locals  and young creat=
ive types. The building is relatively new and my place is  fully furnished =
with a lot of light in the room, working desk, single  bed and HDTV monitor=
. Wake-up to occasional chirping birds, friendly  neighbors, big rooftop pe=
rfect for stargazing, and in-building laundry  (!).There isn't a lot of sto=
rage space, so please take that into  consideration. There is a yoga+zumba+=
krav maga studio a block away  (brownie points) in addition to a large neig=
hborhood park. 8-10 min walk  to either the M at Seneca or L at Dekalb and =
the train ride takes you  into Manhattan within 20 min and Bushwick and Wil=
liamsburg are right  next door. You get the best of both worlds: close acce=
ss to the hustle  'n bustle of Manhattan and a low key place to get a sound=
 night of  sleep. Can't get any better! Please get in touch if this is of i=
nterest  to you!<br /> <br /> Ideally, I am looking for someone to take the=
 place for 2 months.  However, I can also be open to you staying for one-mo=
nth. Negotiable.  You will be living with a super clean roommate and must b=
e  queer-friendly, clean up after yourself, and not bring the party home.  =
There is no smoking, nor pets, allowed in the apartment.<br /> <br /> If th=

want to focus on their projects without the usual  distractions. 1200 sf 3 =
BR house with detached workshop gives ample  space for your craft and your =
mind. Large living room with open kitchen,  tastefully decorated with art a=
nd Tibetan rugs, plus art/work space,  your bedroom and full bathroom downs=
tairs. My bedroom and guest bedroom  upstairs. This cozy 2 story house with=
 cathedral ceilings, 1.5 bath, and  a great wood stove that keeps the house=
 comfortable during the cold  months, looks out on a meandering stream that=
 crosses the property. <br /> <br /> This rental is intended for a single p=
erson, but I am open to discuss the possibility of sharing with a couple.<b=
r /> <br /> We can discuss what would be the best arrangement for both of u=
s. <br /> <br /> One option could be where you basically have the house all=
 to yourself,  except for two weekends a month when I will use the house ex=
clusively.  That obviously would not work if you are planning to move into =
the house  full-time. Unless you can be flexible about these two weekends. =
<br /> <br /> Another option could be where on average 6 days a week you ha=
ve the  place all to your self. I would come up from NYC about once a week =
to  stay for a day ( 2 nights usually). Holidays can be discussed.<br /> <b=
r /> If you can be okay with any of the above arrangements, this might be a=
  great deal for you. I prefer more prolonged commitments (6+ months ) but =
 will consider shorter rentals. Non-smokers only. <br /> <br /> You can che=
ck the house out on the somewhat dated house website www.catskillrentalhous=
e.com <br /> We are planning to install a washer/dryer in the next 6 months=
. And a  bathhouse with sauna-room next to the stream in the next 12 months=
 or  so. <br /> <br /> If you're wondering what kind of art I'm involved wi=
th you can see and  hear some of that on my website: www.marcelvanrootselaa=
r.com<br /> <br /> Rent $1000/month plus utilities. $2500 security deposit =
plus references. <br /> <br /> Local Transportation: Buses to New Paltz or =
Kingston, local cab. Or drive up yourself<br /><br /> Please contact Marcel=

HE APARTMENT<br /> We are a recently married couple that need a little more=
 space to  spread out. We started our search a bit early and found an apart=
ment  before our lease is up on September 1st. If we find a tenant to initi=
ate  a new year one lease, the owner will release us from our lease early  =
without penalty. We found this apartment almost two years ago and it was  a=
 great deal. We would like to share this opportunity with someone who  may =
be looking to move in by June 1st and initiate a one year lease.<br /> <br =
/> CONTACT<br /> If interested in more information or viewing the apartment=
, please send  an email. Someone will contact you back quickly. Serious inq=
uiries  only!<br /> <br /> The apartment will be shown in the evenings.<br =

br /> <br /> This is really super important: I'm looking for someone mature=

boring! But it's essential my neighbors are undisturbed and there is  absol=
utely no noise or drama.<br /> <br /> The apartment works for couples, thou=

 July 3<br /><br /> Hi, I am a bit of a regular on Stephanie's list, and ha=
ve always been  thankful for the wonderful people her project has sent me t=
o rent my  lovely furnished apartment.<br /> <br /> For this time around I =
will be going away for 8 weeks to Boston for a  residency and am looking fo=
r a quiet, clean and respectful roommate for a  short term sublet that has =
the potential to become a longer term  rental. <br /> <br /> From June 11 -=
 29 I will be renting out my furnished bedroom at $65 a  day. It is the sma=
ller bedroom of a real 800 sq ft two bedroom apartment  in a brand new elev=
ator building. The larger master bedroom is  currently being rented by a yo=
ung actress from Spain until June 29.  After she leaves the, the larger roo=
m will be available until July 3  after which the whole place will be full =
until August 1. After August  1st I am looking for new roommates to rent bo=
th the smaller room until  August 11 and the larger master bedroom for long=
 term at $1,300 a month.<br /> <br /> Ok, so I know this sounds rather comp=
licated, but if you are intrigued  lets start a conversation to see what we=
 can work out. You can read some  great reviews of my place through airbnb =
at  https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17716<br /> <br /> The rent includes all u=
tilities and internet, shared bathroom and a  fully stocked kitchen (tend t=
o try to keep it close to vegetarian with  just chicken or fish.) Both room=
s are furnished with a bed, chairs,  storage shelves, a closet, sheets, tow=
els and blankets. My smaller room  has a murphy bed that can be raised to a=
llow space for working at a desk  or practicing yoga. The Master bedroom ha=
s a bed that can fold up into a  couch, a desk, a few smaller tables and a =
wonderful antique dining  table for eating in. <br /> <br /> While I am awa=
y the living room will be available to share with a dining  table, desks an=
d couch. When I return in August I use the living room  as my office/studio=
 when I work at home.<br /> <br /> I am on the second floor facing north on=
 a quiet residential street with  tree top views, AC, WiFi, hard wood floor=
s and good clean neighbors,  very safe. Alas there is no laundry in the bui=
lding, but plenty of  Laundromats around the corner, as well as 2 major sub=
way stops, nice  supermarket and lots of cool restaurants and bars nearby. =
The best part  is only being 2 blocks north of Central Park!<br /><br /> <a=

we, $169,000, Vermont, 1,300 sq. feet plus an unheated  barn, Great deal in=
 the village of Stowe, VT, 1850 house with barn  (future studio)<br /> Avai=
lable: now<br /><br /> My brother and I just lowered the price on our famil=
y house to $169,000  (tax assessed value is $194,000). I am incredulous tha=
t this investment  opportunity hasn't been snapped up already, but we liste=
d it just as  winter was coming on - not the best time for house sales.<br =
/> <br /> Naturally I am writing this in effort to sell fast, and am comple=
tely  biased, BUT it really is a great deal! A historic Victorian on Stowe =
 village property, =BD acre lot with lovely woods behind it. Our bedroom  w=
indow just below the gingerbread roof peak (seen in second photo) has a  vi=
ew of Mt. Mansfield (the living room window used to, but some trees  have g=
rown in the way). My brother and I walked to school everyday to  what is no=
w Helen Day Art Center, so the house is about =BD mile from the  village ce=
nter. My mother lived in the house from 1957 until a month  before she died=
 last August. <br /> <br /> What are the negatives? Although you could live=
 there right away as my  mother did - everything works fine - most Stowe-it=
es would want to  renovate EVERYTHING. For instance, there is no shower in =
the bathroom,  simply an old clawfoot tub. One could easily put $100,000 in=
to the place  and have the greatest up-to-date interior within a charming h=
istoric  exterior on a big lot with woods to explore AND an easy walk to th=
e  village. This isn't a challenge for everyone, but a great investment for=
  those who see the value of a Stowe property. According to our realtor,  t=
he other negative for most people is that there is a shared driveway.  All =
I can say is we've never had a problem with the right of way, and  there is=
 room for expansion. Because it's in a historic district, you  can add on, =
but cannot tear the house down.<br /> Ask me any questions,<br /> Leslie Fr=

ouple in our 30's seeking a sublet  for June in Brooklyn. Williamsburg/ Gre=
enpoint area would be most  convenient for us but we are open to all areas.=
 <br /> <br /> A house-sit would be ideal but we are open to reasonable ren=
ts as well  depending on the space. We are very responsible, can take great=
 care of  your dogs, plants etc and will be super conscientious about your =
home.  Unfortunately due to allergies we can't take care of cats. <br /> <b=
r /> We would prefer a private apt or house, but are open to share situatio=
ns as well. <br /> <br /> We can also offer trades as well of some skilled =
labor (flooring, tiling, and other basic construction). <br /> <br /> Many =
Thanks.<br /><br /> Please contact holen Kahn at <a style=3D"color: black;"=

 /><br /> Hey there! <br /> I'm a 26 year old filmmaker from Texas who's be=
en living in Brooklyn for  about 3 years now. I've been happily living in G=
reenpoint for almost 2  years, but new landlords sending the rent through t=
he roof have forced  me to relocate. <br /> <br /> About me: I work as a fr=
eelance filmmaker, and also as a home designer's  assistant on the side. My=
 hours vary but I always have steady work, and  when I'm home I'm usually q=
uietly plugging away at some editing  project. I'm very clean, respectful, =
responsible, and reliable with  payments. I'm looking for the same in house=
mates.<br /> <br /> I'm looking for an available room with a window, and I =
have a soft spot  for old Brooklyn buildings with tons of character. I'm ho=
ping to find a  place to stay at least one year. In addition to most Brookl=
yn  neighborhoods I'm also interested in Ridgewood, Queens. <br /> <br /> I=
 would also be interested in finding someone to join me in a search for  a =
3 bedroom apartment for June 1, as another option--I have a third  person i=
n mind already who would be interested.<br /><br /> Local Transportation: I=
deally along AC, JMZ, FG, or BQ lines.<br /><br /> Please contact Jason Hoo=
