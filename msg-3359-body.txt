Hello List-
Here are listings as of 5/1/13
Listings Project Story of the Week

Your Listings Project cuts through the cacophony of social media with a dir=
ect weekly
email. After flogging my summer studio sublet on Facebook/twitter/Instagram=
 with
 no results, I posted my listing with you. Moments after Listings went out,=
 I received
a number of inquiries. By mid-afternoon I cherry-picked the one that seemed=
 just
 right (AND it turned out we had mutual friends).  We met at the space the =
next=20
day and sealed the deal.

awesome! thanks!!

Joy

$325 per month, Ridgewood, share of 250 square feet, Studio share in active=
 artist
building.
Available: May 1, 2013 through December 2013 or longer
I am looking for someone to share my studio space located in 17-17  Troutma=
n in=20
Ridgewood- 3 blocks from the Jefferson L Stop, restaurants,  coffee shop, g=
rocery
store/deli. There are 3 galleries located in the  building along with a lar=
ge shared
deck with a view of manhattan. The  space itself is average sized, with one=
 20 ft.
x 17 ft. wall, perfect  for painters who require lots of wall space as I do=
. There
is small  amount of storage space, with permission to build shelving, and a=
 slop
  sink in the space for the two of us to share. There is access to a  freig=
ht elevator
and free wi-fi. No move in fee or deposit, just pay  your first month's ren=
t. You
will have 24 hour building access- my hours  fluctuate but I prefer to work=
 in the
evenings.
I'm a young artist and I primarily make large figurative paintings. I've  b=
een in
NY for 2 years, having moved here from Boston where I attended  grad school=
.
I'm easy to get along with and to share with. I'm hoping to find someone  a=
s interested
in the thriving Bushwick arts scene as I am. Our building  will be included=
 in Bushwick
open studios, and there is a large amount  of foot traffic when the galleri=
es in
 the building have openings. It's  really a perfect place for young artists=
 who=20
are eager to make  connections and to be located in the seat of where thing=
s are
 happening.

ROOMS FOR RENT

$725 per month, West Harlem, Small Room in Trendy Minimalist Apt
Available: 05/01/13 through 05/01/14
Great room available in a freshly renovated apartment on up and coming  146=
th and
Amsterdam Ave. The kitchen has all new stainless steel  appliances, includi=
ng dishwasher
and huge granite counter top.
Brand new laundry room in basement of building!
Hard wood floors throughout apartment with EXPOSED BRICK in each room.
Basically the apartment is small (not suited to someone with lots of furnit=
ure)=20
but is really nice.
This is for a MAY 1 move-in date. The apt is furnished but the room is  not=
 (UNFURNISHED
bedroom), it is also the smallest (hence cheapest) room  in the apartment. =
It comes
with built-in closet with storage space  above. The room faces the inside o=
f the
 building, so it is pretty quiet,  and although it has a large window with =
airflow
it receives minimal  direct sunlight.
The 2 roommates are males (1 gay, 1 straight) in their mid-twenties and  wo=
rk in
 education. We're both fun/laid back, work regular hours and  aren't always=
 in the
apt. We enjoy a movie, music and making the most of  the really nice kitche=
n (bonus
points for cooks).
The ideal roommate will have a steady job to pay rent on time and is  respe=
ctful
 of the space and of each other (gay-friendly is obviously a  must).. You m=
ust be
CLEAN, help around the apartment and be cool with a  small dog that pops up=
 every
once in a while when we pet sit for a  friend.
No drugs- and smokers will need to take it to the roof or to our great loca=
l bar
 (Harlem Public).
Con Ed, internet and a cleaning lady are split three ways.
Please send me a little info about yourself, and a few dates/times when you=
 are=20
available to see the place.
Thanks!

$1150 per month, Williamsburg, Big room in fantastic apartment with huge ya=
rd 2=20
blocks from Graham Ave L
Available: 5/15/13 through indefinite
My roommate is moving in with his lovely girlfriend (yay) and I need a  new=
 roomie.
The room is about 12 x 14 with 2 closets and 2 windows.  Shared living room=
, NYC-large
kitchen (wonderful for actually cooking  in), normal bathroom and a dining/=
office
area. The apartment is on the  first floor, 1/2 a floor up from street leve=
l. The
kitchen opens onto a  back porch with stairs down to a beautiful yard (we c=
ompost
and pick the  peaches and figs and grow other plants here and there, but th=
ere's
 lots  of space for more).
We have the best landlord in North Brooklyn, a super nice guy who lives  ar=
ound=20
the corner, fixes things promptly, and whose daughter sells us  Girl Scout =
cookies.
I've lived here for 2 years and couldn't be happier.
I'm 33, run the communications department at a small art museum, and am  pr=
etty=20
relaxed and normal (I think...). I work a lot, do yoga, and when  I'm home =
like=20
to cook or relax with a glass of wine and some  contemporary fiction or a n=
etflick.
We have wi-fi right now but no  cable, which is fine with me, but I could n=
egotiate.
I'd prefer someone  early 30s or late 20s, professional or professional-ish=
. Cats
are ok  (two lovely feline ladies are moving out) but no dogs please.
I'd be open to a couple but because the apartment would be a little  crampe=
d with
3 people so would have to charge more so that would be a  conversation...
Look forward to meeting you!

some reason - not complaining!  Big and BRIGHT  shared living room.  Storag=

 All the usuals... a piano, couple  banjos, projector for movie night...
Who are we?
Well without getting into it too much: Both in our late 20's / early  30's.=
  Dan
 is a sushi chef by trade and a handy-man by default as it  runs in the fam=

 - we have
a couple  banjo's, some guitars and a piano.
Who are you?
Are with financial means. Don't care what it is, probably a job, but  could=
 be a
 student or other thing.  You're a chill person with somewhat  regular hour=
s and
 no shady history.  Ok that one time in Vegas doesn't  count... we get it, =
we've
 been there.  Really, we just want someone who's  pretty laid back and can =
be on
 time with bills and rent and who is  medium clean (we don't live in a Crat=
e & Barrel
mag ;).  Purplish  green hair with face tattoos of Elmo and likes to do int=
erpretive
dance  to silent films?  No problem.  We have a dance studio and a good sen=
se  of
humor.
Pets are cool - just no cats that pee on my bed, or pups that chew up my re=
cord=20
collection.  Ok...Rick James is fair game.
Rent is $900 + last month/deposit =3D $2700 move-in.  We know that's a lot =
but can
 work something out for the right person.
P.S. These pics aren't the most current, but you get it...

Available: June 1st 2013 through May 31st 2014
I am looking for a new roommate to share my 2 bedroom apartment in Crown  H=

 You must be able to sign a 1 year lease. The room is 8'x10',  and the apar=

 not.
  I prefer to keep a quiet, laid  back atmosphere in the apartment.  I pref=
er a=20

  questions.

$1000 per month, Upper East Side, 90 sq foot room in a big apartment, Quiet=
, peaceful
home in a fantastic location.
Available: May 1st
Our apartment is on East 88th Street between Lexington and Park, which  put=
s it=20
just a couple of blocks from the 86th Street 4/5/6 Station and  also just a=
 couple
blocks from Central Park. The street is relatively  quiet, but lots of groc=
eries
 stores, restaurants, stores, theaters, etc  are within easy walking distan=
ce. The
surrounding neighborhood is very  safe, quiet, and calm. The apartment is o=
n the
 fifth and top floor of an  elevator building, and is in the back of the bu=
ilding.
The room easily fits a full size bed with space left over for a desk and  d=
resser.
A queen size bed works fine too. It's about 90 square feet,  plus there is =
a large
walk-in closet in the hallway that is shared with  one other roommate. The =
room=20
has a window that gets decent light (but  doesn't have much of a view). It =
opens
 onto a fire escape that you can  sit on. The room comes unfurnished.
The apartment has a big living room and a big kitchen (at least by  Manhatt=
an standards).
The rest of the apartment other than the bedroom  is furnished. The kitchen=
 has=20
a dishwasher. There are lots of windows  throughout the apartment. We don't=
 have
 much of a view out any of the  windows, but we do get good light. There is=
 no laundry
in the building,  but there are nearby places.
There are no pets allowed and no smoking of any kind in the apartment.
Four people live in the apartment currently and we're looking for a  replac=
ement
 for one person. I would describe us as considerate,  respectful, responsib=
le, mature,
friendly, laid back, clean, and  generally quite quiet. We are all busy wit=
h the
 things that we do, but  also value having a peaceful home.
We're looking for someone to move in as early as May 1st and by May 15th at=
 the=20
latest.
Here's what we're looking for in a roommate:
- You are very considerate and respectful of those you live with.
- You're friendly and sociable.
- You communicate well, including communicating in a healthy way when somet=
hing=20
is bothering you.
- You want to live in a place that feels like a pleasant, secure home  for =
you and
for the other roommates. You're willing to contribute to  making it such a =
home.
- You have experience living with roommates.
- You clean up after yourself and contribute to keeping the apartment clean=
.
- You are way past wild partying and you would never bring a party home. (S=
ocializing
and light drinking are fine.)
- You are responsible with paying rent and utilities.
- You have no addictions.
- Having a partner who stays over sometimes is totally fine, but  bringing =
home=20
someone you just hooked up with is definitely not.
- You don't have any pets. (No exceptions to this whatsoever.)
- Be willing and able to sign the lease in August when it is due for  renew=
al. (Rent
might go up a little at that point.) This means that you  should have good =
credit,
earn enough to be approved (which means you  earn annually forty times the =
monthly
rent), and have someone to be a  guarantor on the lease. (The landlord requ=
ires=20
a guarantor for everyone,  no matter how much you make.)
Please only respond if you meet all of these requirements. Please let us  k=
now your
occupation, usual daily schedule, desired move-in date, phone  number, and =
a brief
description of yourself.

ent in
the lovely Columbia Waterfront neighborhood.
Available: June 1
Greetings, I have a room to rent in my cozy 2 bedroom known to charm the  h=
eck out
of everyone who steps foot inside. Exposed brick, great light,  wooden shel=
ves piled
with handmade pottery, comfortable furniture -- it  is a homey place.  O'Co=

The room is bright, quiet, and comfortable, comes with a dresser and a  spe=
ctacular
view from the bedroom window of Lower Manhattan.  It's  10'x12'. There are =
no closets
in the room or anywhere in the apartment,  nor is there extra storage in th=

direct
an art residency program in Williamsburg and freelance in art  handling sal=

out $50

definitely
a non-smoking  apartment.
This neighborhood is fantastic - nestled between the beautiful  brownstones=
 of Carroll
Gardens, and the salty seaside charm of Red Hook.  We have Pok Pok, Alma (r=
ooftop
terrace with the very same view you'll  get from your bedroom window, but w=
ith more
guacamole) and the B61 Bar  below it, lots of other restaurants (more all t=
he time).
There is also  Jalopy Theatre with great old-timey, bluegrass, and swing mu=
sic every
 night of the week right here on Columbia Street.
15 minute walk to the Carroll F/G train, or walk/B61 it to Court Street or =

$1200 per month, Cobble Hill, Large Bedroom with Fire Escape, Large one  be=
droom
 available in a 3 bedroom apartment for the month of May in a  prime locati=
on --
 access to 2, 3, 4, 5, F, G, A, C, R trains
Available: May 1st (flexible before/after) through May 31st
I have a bright and beautiful bedroom available in a prime location in  Cob=
ble Hill
(right at Court and Atlantic St), right near hundreds of  amazing restauran=
ts and
within 15 minutes of lower Manhattan. The room  can be furnished or unfurni=
shed,
 but it comes with a bed, desk and  dresser. The apartment has all new appl=
iances,
granite counter tops, and  a nice sized communal living space. The bedroom =
is in
 the back of the  building, so it stays very quiet.
Cobble Hill is probably the most charming neighborhood in Brooklyn with  br=
ownstone-lined
streets and blocks to Brooklyn Bridge Park with idyllic  views of the city,=
 Statue
of Liberty and the Brooklyn and Manhattan  bridges.
The apartment is right at Court and Atlantic street, across the street  fro=
m Trader
Joe's, a fresh market on the corner, and many other  conveniences within fo=
otsteps
-- literally. It's super easy to get to  the city and most other parts of B=
rooklyn,
including Williamsburg  because the G is right there.
I have 3 other roommates who are incredibly clean and respectful and  gener=
ally=20
doing their own thing, so it doesn't feel like there are a ton  of people i=
n the
 apartment all at once. Two of the roommates are an  engaged couple in thei=
r late
20s, who share the master bedroom with  their adorable and literally the sw=
eetest,
most respectful dog I've ever  met ( and I'm a dog person), Ella. One is a =
freelance
videographer and  the other is an architect. The other roommate works for a=
 progressive
 nonprofit and travels a lot.
I am traveling most of May and would like to sublet my apartment out until =
May 31st.
Please email me to express interest.
Pictures upon request.

We are looking anywhere in Park Slope, Prospect Heights, or  Windsor Terrac=

- private or shared backyard**
- access to washer/dryer**

A little about us:
My partner is a veterinarian and circus performer/dancer/acrobat who  just =
had a
 baby girl in November.  I am a full spectrum doula and  pre-nursing/midwif=
ery student.
 We are exceptional tenants who really  treasure a lovely, peaceful and cle=

Work for Rent, Hoboken, New Jersey, Bunk available for Handy Deckhand  aboa=
rd historic
ship in exchange for 25 hours of work p/wk.
Date: ASAP
Ahoy!
We're looking for a hands-on, responsible, and eager addition to our  crew =
of 4=20
(13 if you count the animals.). Yankee Ferry is an historic  ferryboat, 106=
 years
old, now privately-owned and maintained. We're  docked (permanently, we don=
't go
 out at sea) right on the Hudson River  in Hoboken, NJ, with all of Manhatt=
an as
 our vista.
Yankee is an old girl, so she requires lots of care, and in return she  pro=
vides
 us one of the richest experiences of our lives. A ship this  size (~150' f=
rom bow
to stern), made of wood and steel, and entirely  subject to the elements, i=
s always
needing, sometimes crucial, work and  attention. In addition to keeping Yan=
kee floating
and sparkling, we also  spend our blood and sweat (no tears) hosting incred=
ible=20
private and  public events of all kinds and sizes, continuing Yankee's dili=
gent=20
 service to the world.
We're looking for the right pair of fresh hands to join the adventure. Mand=
atory
 requirements of our new crew member are:
1) Must be handy - Boat experience is a huge plus, but not necessary.  The =
more=20
carpentry, repair work, electric, plumbing, welding, etc. that  you know, t=
he better.
You don't need to be an expert, but you must at  least be familiar with wor=
king=20
with tools and have the sensitivity and  general wherewithal of how things =
work=20
and how to fix them. Any other  skills or talents are all pluses too.
2) Must be reliable and trustworthy -
3) Respectful - to each other, to the rules, and most importantly to Yankee=
 herself.
So if you think you're up for the adventure, tell me. Who are you, what  ar=
e you
 good at, and what do you think of this opportunity?
I look forward to hearing from you.
Ahoy!

Service (Fine Art Printing / Scanning Service), Affordable Archival Ink Jet=
/Pigment
Prints on Paper and Fabric
Fiber Ink Studio is the creation of two photographers with a combined  digi=
tal and
darkroom printing experience of twenty years. We are a  pigment / ink jet p=
rint=20
and scanning studio and carry a wide variety of  high quality acid free arc=
hival
 papers including cotton rag, bamboo and  kozo (Hahnem=FChle, Cranes, Epson=
, Ilford
and more). Jacquard fabrics  include silk, linen, cotton and many more. Pri=
nts are
color accurate,  fairly priced and come with the personalized service not a=
vailable
at  the commercial labs. We print with Epson digital printers, UltraChrome =
 HDR=20
inks and custom profiles within a fully color managed environment.  Proofs =
included
on many orders. Free hand delivery in most NYC  locations.
Not sure about process or papers? We are happy to meet and show papers  and=
 samples.
Our goal is to give artists the results best suited to  their individual wo=
rk. Single
piece orders welcome and price breaks on  editions up to 40% available. We =
are located
in Brooklyn  (happy to meet  in Manhattan) and accept orders from outside N=
YC. For

age space, with permission to build shelving, and a slop  sink in the space=
 for the two of us to share. There is access to a  freight elevator and fre=

will have 24 hour building access- my hours  fluctuate but I prefer to work=
 in the evenings. <br /> <br /> I'm a young artist and I primarily make lar=
ge figurative paintings. I've  been in NY for 2 years, having moved here fr=
om Boston where I attended  grad school. <br /> <br /> I'm easy to get alon=

hared living room, NYC-large kitchen (wonderful for actually cooking  in), =
normal bathroom and a dining/office area. The apartment is on the  first fl=
oor, 1/2 a floor up from street level. The kitchen opens onto a  back porch=
 with stairs down to a beautiful yard (we compost and pick the  peaches and=
 figs and grow other plants here and there, but there's lots  of space for =
more). <br /> <br /> We have the best landlord in North Brooklyn, a super n=
ice guy who lives  around the corner, fixes things promptly, and whose daug=
hter sells us  Girl Scout cookies. I've lived here for 2 years and couldn't=
 be happier.  <br /> <br /> I'm 33, run the communications department at a =
small art museum, and am  pretty relaxed and normal (I think...). I work a =
lot, do yoga, and when  I'm home like to cook or relax with a glass of wine=
 and some  contemporary fiction or a netflick. We have wi-fi right now but =
no  cable, which is fine with me, but I could negotiate. I'd prefer someone=
  early 30s or late 20s, professional or professional-ish. Cats are ok  (tw=
o lovely feline ladies are moving out) but no dogs please. <br /> <br /> I'=

  No problem.  We have a dance studio and a good sense  of humor.  <br /> <=

ens onto a fire escape that you can  sit on. The room comes unfurnished.<br=

by  Manhattan standards). The rest of the apartment other than the bedroom =
 is furnished. The kitchen has a dishwasher. There are lots of windows  thr=

, but we do get good light. There is no laundry in the building,  but there=
 are nearby places.<br /> <br /> There are no pets allowed and no smoking o=
f any kind in the apartment.<br /> <br /> Four people live in the apartment=
 currently and we're looking for a  replacement for one person. I would des=
cribe us as considerate,  respectful, responsible, mature, friendly, laid b=
ack, clean, and  generally quite quiet. We are all busy with the things tha=
t we do, but  also value having a peaceful home.<br /> <br /> We're looking=
 for someone to move in as early as May 1st and by May 15th at the latest.<=

dly and sociable.<br /> - You communicate well, including communicating in =
a healthy way when something is bothering you.<br /> - You want to live in =
a place that feels like a pleasant, secure home  for you and for the other =
roommates. You're willing to contribute to  making it such a home.<br /> - =
You have experience living with roommates.<br /> - You clean up after yours=
elf and contribute to keeping the apartment clean.<br /> - You are way past=
 wild partying and you would never bring a party home. (Socializing and lig=
ht drinking are fine.)<br /> - You are responsible with paying rent and uti=
lities.<br /> - You have no addictions.<br /> - Having a partner who stays =
over sometimes is totally fine, but  bringing home someone you just hooked =
up with is definitely not.<br /> - You don't have any pets. (No exceptions =
to this whatsoever.)<br /> - Be willing and able to sign the lease in Augus=
t when it is due for  renewal. (Rent might go up a little at that point.) T=
his means that you  should have good credit, earn enough to be approved (wh=
ich means you  earn annually forty times the monthly rent), and have someon=
e to be a  guarantor on the lease. (The landlord requires a guarantor for e=
veryone,  no matter how much you make.)<br /> <br /> Please only respond if=
 you meet all of these requirements. Please let us  know your occupation, u=

 one  bedroom available in a 3 bedroom apartment for the month of May in a =
 prime location -- access to 2, 3, 4, 5, F, G, A, C, R trains<br /> Availab=
le: May 1st (flexible before/after) through May 31st<br /><br /> I have a b=
right and beautiful bedroom available in a prime location in  Cobble Hill (=
right at Court and Atlantic St), right near hundreds of  amazing restaurant=
s and within 15 minutes of lower Manhattan. The room  can be furnished or u=
nfurnished, but it comes with a bed, desk and  dresser. The apartment has a=
ll new appliances, granite counter tops, and  a nice sized communal living =
space. The bedroom is in the back of the  building, so it stays very quiet.=
 <br /> <br /> Cobble Hill is probably the most charming neighborhood in Br=
ooklyn with  brownstone-lined streets and blocks to Brooklyn Bridge Park wi=
th idyllic  views of the city, Statue of Liberty and the Brooklyn and Manha=
ttan  bridges. <br /> <br /> The apartment is right at Court and Atlantic s=
treet, across the street  from Trader Joe's, a fresh market on the corner, =
and many other  conveniences within footsteps -- literally. It's super easy=
 to get to  the city and most other parts of Brooklyn, including Williamsbu=
rg  because the G is right there.<br /> <br /> I have 3 other roommates who=
 are incredibly clean and respectful and  generally doing their own thing, =
so it doesn't feel like there are a ton  of people in the apartment all at =
once. Two of the roommates are an  engaged couple in their late 20s, who sh=
are the master bedroom with  their adorable and literally the sweetest, mos=
t respectful dog I've ever  met ( and I'm a dog person), Ella. One is a fre=
elance videographer and  the other is an architect. The other roommate work=
s for a progressive  nonprofit and travels a lot. <br /> <br /> I am travel=
ing most of May and would like to sublet my apartment out until May 31st. <=

rnished<br /> Available: May 7 (or thereabouts) through June 7th (or there =

ng the first  month of the lease. The apartment is really huge for New York=
. It's got a  bright bedroom with lots of windons and a fire escape and 2 b=
ig  closets. The bedroom is big enough for a bed, desk, dresser, table and =
 chair. The former tenant used it as a living room, actually. <br /> <br />=
 The living room is huge, enough space for a dining table and a couch.  It'=
s got a coat closet, a big kitchen with room for a small table to eat  at. =
<br /> <br /> I will rent the entire place furnished or unfurnished (and br=
ing down the price for unfurnished). <br /> <br /> It's located right on th=
e park and in an amazing location -- right near  great cafes and restaurant=
s on Franklin Ave in the upcoming Prospect  Heights/Crown Heights area. It'=
s very close to the Prospect Park farmers  market on Saturdays, Brooklyn Mu=
seum and Brooklyn Library.<br /> <br /> It's incredibly convenient. The bui=
lding basically sits on the Franklin  Ave 2, 3, 4, 5 trains and the S -- sh=
uttle from Bed Stuy to the park.<br /> <br /> Email to inquire and/or for p=

re a chef and english teacher, both in our late twenties.  Being convenient=
ly located near the L or G in the  Williamsburg/Greenpoint/Bushwick area or=
 the G or 4 in Fort Greene/Bed  Stuy is preferable but we are open to anyth=
ing for the right space. <br /> <br /> Ideally, the apartment is a real 2br=
 (not a railroad) with windows and  good sunlight, wood floors, period deta=
iling and access to a backyard.  Of course one can only wish for all such t=
hings to exist, but I am a  former farmer and the ability to tend to some c=
rops in a backyard this  summer would be great. I like a clean, simple livi=
ng space that feels  open and homey. <br /> <br /> Please contact me if thi=

<br /> Ahoy!<br /> <br /> We're looking for a hands-on, responsible, and ea=
ger addition to our  crew of 4 (13 if you count the animals.). Yankee Ferry=
 is an historic  ferryboat, 106 years old, now privately-owned and maintain=
ed. We're  docked (permanently, we don't go out at sea) right on the Hudson=
 River  in Hoboken, NJ, with all of Manhattan as our vista.<br /> <br /> Ya=
nkee is an old girl, so she requires lots of care, and in return she  provi=
des us one of the richest experiences of our lives. A ship this  size (~150=
' from bow to stern), made of wood and steel, and entirely  subject to the =
elements, is always needing, sometimes crucial, work and  attention. In add=
ition to keeping Yankee floating and sparkling, we also  spend our blood an=
d sweat (no tears) hosting incredible private and  public events of all kin=
ds and sizes, continuing Yankee's diligent  service to the world. <br /> <b=
r /> We're looking for the right pair of fresh hands to join the adventure.=
 Mandatory requirements of our new crew member are: <br /> 1) Must be handy=
 - Boat experience is a huge plus, but not necessary.  The more carpentry, =
repair work, electric, plumbing, welding, etc. that  you know, the better. =
You don't need to be an expert, but you must at  least be familiar with wor=
king with tools and have the sensitivity and  general wherewithal of how th=
ings work and how to fix them. Any other  skills or talents are all pluses =
too.<br /> 2) Must be reliable and trustworthy - <br /> 3) Respectful - to =
each other, to the rules, and most importantly to Yankee herself. <br /> <b=
r /> So if you think you're up for the adventure, tell me. Who are you, wha=
t  are you good at, and what do you think of this opportunity?<br /> <br />=
 I look forward to hearing from you. <br /> <br /> Ahoy!<br /><br /> Please=
