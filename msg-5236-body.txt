Hello, List!
Here are the listings as of Nov 27, 2013.


Listings Project Story of the Week:
Thanks so much. I got the listing this week. - I didn't need it though because I was moving yesterday into an apartment share with someone I met through this listing earlier in the month!! I am so thrilled. I am happy to stay on the listing, though. I may be looking for an art studio share at some point soon. Or other things. You never know!
Thanks again, Sandy


Best,
Stephanie

Available: Dec 01, 2013

Large area in a huge shared studio in Bushwick. Amazing space to work. I love it here and the only reason I'm leaving is because I'm working out of town and can't use it anymore. The space is open and shared with two other artists. Both are very professional, very quiet and often not there, so if you like working alone it still feels very private. Excellent light, high ceilings and large walls for working. The building has 24 hour access, freight elevator and slop sinks and bathrooms. Available as of Dec. 1st but if you need to take it after that date the rent will be prorated for that month.

Available: Dec 01, 2013 through Nov 30, 2014

Hi,

I have one bedroom available in a big two bedroom apartment that I just signed the lease on! It's currently totally empty (though I plan on moving my stuff in asap), so I'm really looking for a person who will help me turn the space into a home. 

Full disclosure: the apartment is a railroad, but your room is the one connected to the living room/ kitchen/ bathroom, so you wouldn't have to walk through my space to access anything. Plus, my room has a separate entrance, so you would have total privacy.

The Upsides:
-The apartment is spacious for the city. The rooms are wide and long, so we won't be living on top of each other. In fact, your room would be the bigger of the two (about 200 sq. ft.) 

- There is a community garden next door that all tenants have key access to, plus there is a little fire escape off the bathroom, so if...

$650.00 Per Month, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, Small, bright, clean room in veggie home avail. for sublet ! Females only
Available: Nov 23, 2013 through Jan 23, 2014

Hi there -

I am looking for an (actually) clean, quiet, respectful, cat loving, (veggie preferred) female subletter/roomie for 2 months in Greenpoint. The room is quite bright, very clean, has a window, and comes furnished with a bed, bed linens, a small dresser, bookshelf and hanging rack. It's not very big as far as floor space goes, so would be best for someone who is on an extended visit, or who works a ton, or who is in between places and needs a nice cozy, clean place to crash for a cpl months while they are looking for a more permanent place. The room is a large converted office and has a curtain wall on one side, so there is no noise privacy at all. If you have a significant other, it would be best to probably crash at their pad if you intend to make some noise ;) 

There is a big kitchen and I encourage ppl who love to cook...

Available: Mar 01, 2014

Hello,

I'm looking for a sunny one bedroom apartment,junior bedroom,studio/loft studio for me and my two great cats. An apartment share would be nice as well. My move-in date is 3/1 (when my current lease is up) which I know is still a few months away but I thought I will  start early... Both of my cats are indoor only,very laid-back,friendly and clean. I currently live in Brooklyn and I'm hoping to stay in this borough but I'm open to move to a different borough as well if it is a great fit.

 A little bit about me:
-I work full-time in the fashion industry 9am-7pm Monday - Friday
-I enjoy yoga,pilates,reading,painting,nature, movies (foreign movies)
-Healthy eating,baking (if I find time)
-I usually stay in during the week but like to enjoy the city on the weekends (eg.museums,parks) and running errands of course!

Thank you for...
