Label News

Alright folks, welcome back! It's been a busy, busy month around Sorry
State HQ. We had our very first Record Store Day since we opened the
shop, I finished up my job as an English professor (perhaps never to
return?), we tabled the great Damaged City fest in DC, booked and
played a bunch of shows and generally didn't sleep very much or eat
very well. I'm hoping that May is a lot calmer, but if not that's fine
because I'm loving doing all of this.

As I've mentioned before, things have been pretty quiet on the label
front since the shop opened, but it looks like we'll be back into full
swing with a full slate of releases this summer. A lot of these
projects have been in the works for a while, and as tends to happen in
punk it looks like all of them will be finished at just about the same
time. So goodbye money, hello awesome punk. Here's a run-down of what
this summer should bring:

The first thing to surface will likely be the demo cassette from a
band from Greensboro, North Carolina called Wriggle. I saw these guys
live once a few months ago and they were great... I think one of the
members was wearing an Appendix t-shirt (which is a quick way to my
heart), but their music was great... just pure hardcore in the North
Carolina tradition, i.e. heavy, unpretentious and ever so slightly
metallic. I've been trying to get them back to Raleigh ever since then
but it just hasn't worked out, but a few of them showed up to the
Government Flu show earlier this month and were handing out demos for
free. I took one and was blown away... the production is totally raw
and perfect, and the vocals are adolescent angst personified... it's
like this stuff was left off of the No Core comp by accident. At any
rate, I thought that this demo needed to be heard by more than just 50
people, so we'll be making another run so all of you can hear yet
another great band from North Carolina.

Speaking of great bands from NC, Jeff's band Skem=C3=A4ta just recorded
their debut LP for Sorry State. I've heard the rough mixes and they
sound incredible... it has much heavier, clearer production than the
demo and in some ways the band's roots in Stripmines are even more
apparent because of that, but this thing is just chock full of little
earworm riffs and melodies that I think will really turn heads.

Also in the NC punk department, Whatever Brains are just about done
recording their new record. They actually released a tour CDR that you
can grab in the webstore that features unmastered versions of four
songs that will be on the LP. This record has kind of a funny
backstory. I was telling Rich that lots of people like the Brains when
they hear them, but their long-ish LPs don't really suit the attention
span of the digital age, so I suggested that maybe they should do a
shorter 12" EP next. Rich seemed to think that was a good idea (or at
least he humored me), but I guess it just wasn't in them, because this
is now going to be Sorry State's first double LP. The center-piece
(which takes up two sides of the record) is a 30-minute "rock opera"
that has been blowing my mind ever since I started to hear it coming
together in early demos. We're still working on how this thing is
going to be put together, but the idea is to make it as close to the
price of a single LP as we possibly can, because selling the punks on
a double-LP with a 30-minute song on it is going to be tough enough as
it is, but true Brains fans know that this is by far their most
exciting stuff to date.

One more item of interest for people who follow the North Carolina
scene: the details of this are still coming together, but I may as
well let the cat out of the bag that I'm working on doing a monthly
singles series of all North Carolina bands. There won't be
subscriptions because those inevitably result in disappointment and/or
frustration, but the plan is, starting late summer 2014, to release
one two-song single a month by a great North Carolina band. The first
release will be from Davidians, a new band featuring three guys who
did time in Double Negative along with Colin from Formaldehyde Junkies
/ Safewords / Voight/Kampff. Davidians actually have a 7" coming out
on Deranged in May, but you can already listen to it here (
http://davidians.bandcamp.com/ ). We have a bunch of other bands
already confirmed for the singles series, including No Love, Skem=C3=A4ta,
Black Zinfandel, and probably more than I'm forgetting. There are more
than enough great bands in this state to keep this going for at least
a year, but we'll see how it goes. More details on that as it comes
together I suppose.

Now we move out of NC to the great state of Missouri, where we find
that Dark Ages has finally finished their long-awaited follow-up to
Can America Survive?, which is currently being mastered. It has been
many moons since that phenomenal LP, and Dark Ages have changed quite
a bit, incorporating subtlety and atmosphere that only serve to make
the moments of breakneck hardcore even more powerful.

Staying in the midwest, Broken Prayer also just completed laying down
tracks for the follow-up to their debut LP. I haven't heard anything
yet and I know they have a long mixing process ahead of them, but
Broken Prayer are one of the best bands in the world right now and I'm
confident that this new LP is going to be even better than their
phenomenal first LP.

Our final upcoming release announcement is the debut LP from Japan's
Louder. I was introduced to Louder by Tsubasa from Rough Kids, who
says Louder are his favorite Japanese punk band since Teengenerate.
There's definitely more than a little bit of the raw Japanese
garage-punk of bands like Teengenerate and the Registrators in
Louder's sound, but they also have a subtle melodicism that
immediately calls to mind the mighty Rough Kids themselves. If you're
curious as to what they sound like, you can check out their 2nd single
on Japan's Episode Sounds label here (
http://episodesounds.bandcamp.com/album/get-out-dud ), and sometime in
May I should also have some distro copies of that single so everyone
can get a little more familiar with Sorry State's newest band.

That should keep us more than busy (not to mention broke) for the
summer. There are also rumblings of upcoming recording sessions from
Joint D=E2=89=A0 and Rough Kids, so the fun won't stop there.

One more note before I get to the distro stuff. Jeff and I have a new
band called Prosthesis that started playing shows this month. It's the
first time I've played straight up hardcore in a while and it's been a
blast. If you're curious what we've been up to, here's a video from
our second show... in typically confounding North Carolina hardcore
fashion we start off with a 3-minute epic based off of a mid-20th
century classical symphony. That's how we do. Anyway, thanks so Will
from To Live a Lie Records for filming this!

Here's a direct link in case the video doesn't show up in your email (
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Dq03bCIrsXwM )Hopefully we can also
squeeze in a Prosthesis demo sometime this summer... we'll see!

Jeff's Update

Hey Sorry State Readers!

It's been a crazy last few weeks.  Record Store Day had a whole bunch
of new stuff coming through the doors, but there's a lot of killer new
releases besides those.  First of all, the new Gas Rag LP has to be
one of the best straight up hardcore punk records I've heard in a long
time.  As always, Man In Decline is putting out some great stuff, like
the American pressings of Damaged Head and the Vanna Inget LPs.  I
also can't say enough how much I've been enjoying the Elsinores 12",
it's like if H=C3=BCsker D=C3=BC were a dream-pop band or something.

The last few weekends have been super busy for me.  Mercy Killings
played Damaged City, which was a great time with lots of cool bands.
Thanks again to Nick and Chris for asking us to play!  Mercy Killings
also just got done recording for our 2nd EP, and I think it's gonna
turn out great.  That should be out some time late Summer.

Skem=C3=A4ta also just recorded for our LP that should be out on Sorry
State (hopefully) by the end of Summer as well.  Thanks to everyone
who's grabbed a copy of the demo!  Also wanted to mention that we're
still pulling them together, but we should be playing our first string
of shows out of town at the end of May, so keep an eye out!

Thanks for reading!
-Jeff

Seth's Update

Hey everyone,

It=E2=80=99s been a great month for music.  First off I am a little late =
on
this because we sold out of them before I got the chance to listen to
it, but the Earth Girls Demo is amazing and we got a couple of more
copies so get it before we sell out again.  It is the ideal warm
weather music. There are so many good things coming out of London at
the moment.  The Good Throb LP will probably be on most everyone=E2=80=99s
lists this month.  It is punk at it=E2=80=99s best.  The Frau tape is more
good snotty British stuff.  The one that I have a hard time not
listening to on repeat though is Personnel=E2=80=99s Ep.  Featuring two
Ex-Shitty Limits (who have switched roles) it still has a lot of the
feel of The Limits.  I for some reason have had a hard time really
pinning it down and describing it (which I=E2=80=99m terrible at anyways).
So just go read Daniel=E2=80=99s description, I=E2=80=99m sure he has said =
what
I=E2=80=99m trying to say very directly and eloquently.  Or maybe just =
skip
it all and get the record.  In short this record is amazing and you
should own it.

Much like everyone else I=E2=80=99m really into the Gas Rag LP and am glad
the Demo got released as a 7=E2=80=9D.  The Achtungs 7=E2=80=9D has been =
blowing
me away.  The vocals remind me of a less polished Carbonas with a very
blown out and bass heavy backing track.  Going Underground also
re-released The Terrorist 7=E2=80=9D, which is drum-machine KBD punk at
it=E2=80=99s best.  I=E2=80=99m sure not for everyone, but I=E2=80=99m =
into it.

I=E2=80=99m sure I=E2=80=99ve forgotten a million things I wanted to =
mention but
that seems like a good start. (oh yeah and there=E2=80=99s more Black
Zinfandel tapes in the store!)

-Seth

Daniel's Update

Seth and Jeff were right that this has been a great month for new
releases, but for me two of them stand head and shoulders above all
the others: the new LPs from Good Throb and Protomartyr. Not only did
I get to see both of these bands live this past month, but I've played
both of these records so much that I'm pretty sure they'll evoke
memories of April 2014 for a long time to come. The bad news is that,
in true Sorry State fashion, both of these are sold out at the moment,
but we have a restock of Good Throb on the way that should be here
early this week and more Protomartyr LPs shouldn't be too far behind.
Speaking of the problem with stuff being sold out, I keep talking
about making this newsletter bi-weekly rather than monthly... I feel
like these are so long they're cumbersome and lots of stuff is sold
out by the time I send this out, so maybe now that this is my only
full-time job I will get on making that change.

Of course there's a TON of other great stuff in this month as well.
You guys really love Gas Rag, and unfortunately both the 12" and demo
7" are sold out (more 12"s should be here Tuesday or Wednesday
hopefully), but you should prioritize getting those when they're in
because both rip. I'm also completely in love with the Personnel 7"...
it features a couple of ex-Shitty Limits, and of all of the
post-Limits projects that have come out in the past few years this is
the one that sounds most like the Limits themselves. I've also been
giving a lot of spins to the great Flesh World LP, the new Perspex
Flesh LP, the new Proxy single, the In School EP, the Violent Outburst
EP, the Crown Court demo, both Warthog EPs, the S.H.I.T. EP, the
Lowest Form LP, the Common Market demo, the Achtungs EP, the new Hard
Skin single, the Frau demo, the Predator LP (temporarily out of stock
as well... sorry!), the new Deformity tape (which SLAYS!), and all the
new jams on 540 Records. It's a long list, but all of the things I
just mentioned are top-shelf ragers!

1. Deformity: new tape (Toxic State)
2. Gas Rag: Beats Off 12" (Beach Impediment)
3. Black Boot: demo cassette (Toxic State)
4. Gas Rag: demo 7" (Not Normal)

Featured Distro Items

Defiant Pose #8 zine w/Rema Rema 7"
Latest issue of this great UK zine... they don't really make them
like this (at least not too much) anymore... an old-school music
fanzine with a totally cut-and-paste layout and real depth to the
content. This time around you get interviews with Rema-Rema, Heretics,
Stench, Cervix, and Blood & Roses. However, the real treat here is a
7" featuring unreleased material from first-wave UK post-punk band
Rema Rema. The 7" is totally rad... simple, heavy drum machine punk
that has a bit of the anarcho vibe of bands like the Mob, but with the
pulsing, almost dance-y vibe of the Normal or Killing Joke. The
production, though, is raw and the bass sound in particular is really
heavy, making this a lot more aggressive and punk than a lot of other
stuff in this vein.

Distort #44 zine
Latest issues featuring the same top-notch critical assessments,
writing, and graphic design that you've come to expect. Features
writing about / interviews with the Kinks, Dribble / Gutter Gods,
philosopher John Roffe, HTRK (an old Australian industrial band),
Constant Mongrel, Jock Club, Loke Rahbek (Posh Isolation Records, Lust
for Youth, Croatian Amor, etc.), and philospher Ray Brassier.

Infernoh / Nomad: Split 7" (Brain Solvent Propaganda)
Split 7" between these two noisy hardcore powerhouses released for
their recent east coast US tour. Infernoh are from Sweden and have
that early Totalit=C3=A4r sound down pat... their tracks here are a little
more raw and noisy than their most recent EP, and I think it's all the
better for it. As for NYC's Nomad, I was excited to hear this since
their previous 12" on Toxic State really blew me away. The mastering
on their side of the split isn't quite as ear-splittingly raw as the
12", but the band's total Disclose style shines through clearly, with
a bit more emphasis on the vocals this time around. You can't do much
better than this for a split of noisy, nasty d-beat!

S.H.I.T.: Collective Unconsciousness 7" (Iron Lung)
After a couple of absolutely killer tapes and one of the most
powerhouse live shows around here's the debut 7" from Toronto's
S.H.I.T. If you haven't heard them before, this is just straight up,
nasty, noisy hardcore... you get the impression that S.H.I.T. aren't
going for a particular style, they're just playing good old fashioned
four-on-the-floor hardcore and there are few bands doing it better. If
you dig stuff like Gas Rag, Gag, or Warthog this is one that needs to
be in your collection. Beautiful packaging on this one too.

Warthog: Prison 7" (Iron Lung)
2nd EP from this great NYC band, apparently recorded during the same
session as their debut on Katorga Works. As on that record, Warthog
play pulverizing hardcore in the Pick Your King tradition with
slightly high-pitched, incredibly aggressive vocals. This almost has a
Cleveland (i.e. Gordon Solie, Puncture Wound, etc.) vibe to me in
places... it's just so fast, gnarly, and nihilistic. Top-notch
hardcore here.

The Lowest Form: Negative Ecstasy 12" (Iron Lung)
One of my most anticipated releases of 2014 is finally here! I
absolutely loved the Lowest Form's previous demo and 7", and this 12"
absolutely does not disappoint. Of course the Lowest Form are probably
most famous in punk circles for featuring Paco Mus (of La Vida Es Un
Mus Discos, otherwise known as the most trusted man in punk), so you
know that he's not going to bring any weak shit to the table. Indeed,
this LP is all power... raw, noisy, but with little bits of melody
peeking through from time to time to keep you interested. I suppose
this fits in broadly with other noisy, not-insanely-fast hardcore
bands like Hoax or Perspex Flesh, but there's a kind of artiness to
their approach that really separates the Lowest Form from the pack.
Highly recommended if you love forward-thinking hardcore.

Demonbrother: Beyond the Veil 12" (Iron Lung)
I have to say that these days I'm pretty much 100% over anything that
gets labeled power violence, but if anyone can bring me to the table
to check something out it's Iron Lung Records. I have to say, though,
I doubt I would have called this debut LP from Demonbrother power
violence if the label hadn't mentioned that in their description...
there's almost no blasting (maybe there isn't any at all), and the
"noise" bits (i.e. the parts that don't rely on a standard
drums-and-guitar setup) are at least as important (if not more) as the
more straightforward bashing. I suppose you could call this power
violence, but it's much more in line with Man Is the Bastard / Bastard
Noise than the Crossed Out-influenced style that most modern bands try
to cop. So if that's your bag I'd recommend picking this up, because
you know Iron Lung is only going to bring you the best of the best.

Crown Court: Trouble from London demo cassette (Quality Control HC)
Demo tape from this new London band on the impeccable Quality Control
HC label. This isn't really HC, but it definitely keeps with the theme
of quality control because it absolutely rules. Crown Court are an oi!
band, but it seems like most of the bands with an oi!-influenced sound
these days tend to mix that influence with American hardcore (think
Violent Future, Violent Reaction, etc.); however, Crown Court are
straight up, melodic oi!. They bear more than a passing resemblance to
a certain band who started as a great rootsy rock band and later
turned into the most famous bonehead band in the world (hint: they're
named after a common tool)... there's definitely some rocked-out
riffing and leads, and the vocals are just perfect... hoarse and
catchy, belting out simple melodies you can chant on your next trip
down to the football stadium. The oi! trend is definitely starting to
run a little dry, but this is completely different and wholly
invigorating. Highly recommended.

Violent Outburst: Survival Signs 7" (Agitated)
Posthumous 7" from this short-lived Virginia / North Carolina band.
They have kind of a complicated history... they kicked around Raleigh
for a very long time with various lineups (I even recorded an early
unreleased demo for them), played very few shows, but always seemed
right on the verge of being incredible. Two years ago I finally caught
them live, and then all of a sudden they had broken up, half of their
lineup (and one of their songs) absorbed into Mercy Killings. I'm
really glad that this 4-song 7" is seeing the light of day because it
totally rips... it's really a completely different beast from Mercy
Killings, much more mid-paced and the vocals are considerably harsher.
It definitely reminds me of the more mid-paced Wasted Time stuff (the
hand of Zach Pearce is all over this thing), but fused with the
toughness of the New Breed comp. Definitely a complete banger, and
topped off with a totally classy layout to boot. Recommended.

Perspex Flesh: S/T 12" (Static Shock)
Long-awaited debut LP from this band out of Leeds, England. Their
previous 7" on Video Disease was great and the LP totally tops it. I
still feel like Perspex Flesh bear at least a passing resemblance to
Hoax in that their songs tend to trudge along at this really menacing
tempo, but Perspex Flesh is a lot less stripped down. The sound is
really chaotic but at the same time melodic, especially for a hardcore
band. This is probably an out-there reference given the fact that
these guys are a hardcore band, but the way melodies emerge out of the
noisy din actually reminds me a bit of Shoppers at points, though you
can tell these guys have probably paid a lot of attention to their
Rudimentary Peni records as well. As you can probably tell by how all
over the place these references are, this is a pretty
original-sounding LP and definitely one of the best hardcore records
of late. Strongly recommended.

Note: If you run a store or a distro and you're looking to grab some
of these Sorry State is helping to distribute them in the US, so get
in touch for wholesale rates.

Death: Leprosy 12" (Relapse)
Oh boy, am I excited about this one. I'm not a huge death metal guy,
but the stuff I really like I really like, and I really like Death.
Sometimes I feel like death metal can be (somewhat by design) kind of
a boring genre, but Death are just so relentlessly catchy, which is
weird because the intricacy of their riffs and tempo changes often
gets them labeled as kind of a "prog-y" death metal band. I love that
aspect of the band (i.e. they have riffs for MILES), but really it's
the catchiness that keeps me coming back again and again, and if
you're not screaming "PULL THE PLUG" along with the band then you
probably have no soul (and not in the good way). Thankfully this is a
totally faithful reissue, replicating the original artwork and track
listing and featuring solid, powerful mastering. If you have only 5
metal records in your collection one of them should probably be either
Scream Bloody Gore or Leprosy, so get on it.

Common Market: demo cassette (Vile Audio)
Demo tape from this project out of Charlotte, NC featuring two
members of No Power and Stepdad SS doing something a lot more unique
and weird. This is definitely hardcore (it's raw, loud and fast), but
where No Power and Stepdad SS are kind of genre exercises, Common
Market seems to have a much looser, more creative approach. I feel
like this is more in line with genre-bending hardcore like the
Crucifucks, the Feederz, Saccharine Trust, etc. If it were just a
little more ramshackle it might also sound like it could come from the
Toxic State camp... so yeah, this is hardcore that's interesting and
progressive but still totally punk, just like I like it.

Absolut: Punk Survival 12" (Electric Assault)
Debut 12" from this Toronto crust band, and it's totally over the top
in the best way possible. The production is heavy and metallic,
reminding me a bit of Scandinavian Jawbreaker-era Anti-Cimex, but the
vibe is totally different from that record. I always thought of the
mid-period Cimex stuff as being very controlled and contained records,
but this record (despite having really clear, almost metallic
production) just sounds wild, like the band are having an absolutely
great time recording it... listening to this I can't help but think of
heaps of crusties all slammed to the front of the stage, pumping their
beers in the air and having a great time. It's weird that a band can
pull that off without coming off like a lame, contrived "party band."
I must admit I'm not totally sold on the heavily distorted and delayed
vocals, but the music is just so explosive and raging that it's
impossible not to love this.

Actungs: S/T 7" (Going Underground)
Man, I NEVER would have guessed that this record was by a new band...
everything about it from the layout to the production and the
songwriting screams Europe circa '79... it's just absolutely perfect
in every regard. They remind me a lot of Ivy Green (particularly the
high-pitched yet melodic vocals) or the Lost Kids, but with the
totally raw production of a US KBD band. If this thing had actually
come out in the '70s it would probably be one of the best-regarded
records of the era, and it's still a total breath of fresh air now. I
just can't get over how perfect this sounds without sounding the least
bit contrived or retro. Also, I could totally see a band like this
dropping a two-song single, but there are six songs here and they are
all snotty punk scorchers. Seriously, get this... my mind is blown!

The Terrorists: Crazy Life 7" (Going Underground)
Reissue of this uber-rarity from early 80s Bakersfield, California.
When I say uber-rarity I mean it... apparently there are only around
50 copies of this in circulation and I don't even want to think of
what one might sell for. As for the music, it's totally simple, gnarly
punk with a drum machine. They don't really push the drum machine
angle... it's fairly low in the mix, and could probably be mistaken
for a live drummer if you weren't paying to much attention. The riffs
are simple, aggressive, and distorted, reminding me a bit of the early
Metal Urbain stuff, but there are some interesting vocal harmonies
that hint at what some of the UKDIY bands were doing a few years
earlier. It almost sounds to me like Television Personalities or
O-Level if, instead of being obsessed with the Jam and Syd Barrett,
were instead really into the early Riot City Records. Definitely a
period piece, but one of interest to fans of raw early US punk.

Future Punx: Livin' in a Movie 7" (Dull Tools)
Debut single from this Brooklyn band who play dark, aggressive,
synth-punk. The drum machine is right up front in a way that could
associate them with dark, hard synth-punk bands like Total Control
(well, tracks like "Paranoid Video" anyway) or the Normal, but the
vocal and synth melodies are decidedly sunny, recalling MTV-era Devo
or maybe a less distorted, less punk version of Le Shok. I'm a sucker
for this synth-punk stuff as long as it's hard and aggressive, and
this definitely fits the bill.

Hero Dishonest: Kaikki Hajoaa 7" (Peterwalkee)
Latest 7" from this Finnish band, and they still have a wild, almost
indescribable sound (but here goes anyway...). There are elements of
so much different stuff here... they're as fast as any hardcore band,
but the riffing is really quirky and interesting, at points of
reminding me of a much faster Drive Like Jehu or something like that.
They actually do a cover of the Proletariat (but sung in Finnish), and
I suppose that band is a pretty good reference point in how it's fast
like hardcore, but something kind of vaguely post-punk about the way
everything is put together. Like all of their other stuff, this is
really good and terribly underrated in the US.

Whatever Brains: Tour CDR (self-released)
4-song CDR featuring brand new tracks from the almighty Whatever
Brains. Continuing along the electronically-infused post-punk path of
their last full-length, this teaser will scratch your itch until the
new Brains album is out this fall.

Various: The Mixxxtape cassette (Criminal Rights)
12-song compilation tape of current and recent straight edge hardcore
bands from across the globe. Features songs from Skaggs, Zero
Progress, Violent Reaction, Freedom, Social Damage, Shrapnel, Coke
Bust, United Rages, Burst, Correction, Stab, and Meth Breath.  Solid
overview of current straight edge bands playing straight up HC punk
rather than youth crew.

Government Flu: Tension 12" (Refuse)
Debut LP from this Polish hardcore band who have had a number of EP
releases over the past few years. When these guys started I feel like
they were very much in the No Way Records school of early 80s retro
USHC, but they've progressed a lot since then... this LP has a lot
more varied influences. The base is still early 80s USHC, but they
aren't afraid of a mid-paced (dare I say it?) breakdown part, and the
guitar tone is really interesting, with very little treble. At points
it kind of reminds me of a more straightforward version of Hoax (but
with snotty, higher-pitched vocals), or maybe even something more
straight edge-sounding like the Flex. Regardless, this is definitely
the band's strongest work yet and definitely recommended for 80s HC
head.

Note: While supplies last, we have the US tour version, which is on
red vinyl and has what looks like a screen printed jacket.

Proxy: Slow Suicide 7" (Ugly Pop)
Brand new 7" from this much talked-about band from Canada that
features former members of Inepsy. As on their previous records, their
sound is a really intriguing mix of Inepsy's kind of rock-infused take
on punk and a more traditional oi! sound. In fact, the a-side, "Slow
Suicide," is probably the most oi! thing they've done... in fact, it's
rock n roll guitar sound almost veers toward pub rock, but the
choruses are pure terrace chant. That might sound like a criticism to
some people, but I love it, and I think the band has a really
interesting and unique sound. This is a band that just keeps getting
better and better... highly recommended.

SFH: Mayor on Crack 7" (Ugly Pop)
Brand new single from this Toronto punk project that came together to
"commemorate" all of the recent drama surrounding the city's notorious
mayor. The main guy behind this project was in 70s Toronto punk band
the Hot Nasties, and this single definitely sounds more like 70s punk
than anything else. It kind of reminds me of "novelty" punk in that
the song is kind of built around a lyric ("we've got a mayor on
crack") and the rest of the song seems built around delivering that
quip a bunch of times. The b-side is a shorter and even jokier song
that's also about Rob ford. While this kind of thing can have a
novel--maybe even throwaway--quality to it, there's something
refreshing about hearing a band that isn't so self-serious and that is
addressing something that's of the moment rather than the
beaten-to-death "timeless" themes that most bands today tend to deal
in. If this had a more retro look to the graphic design I could see it
going over big with the TermBo crowd, but anyone into catchy '77 punk
should be able to get down with this.

Valley Boys: Drone Attack 7" (Ugly Pop)
New 4-song EP from this Toronto band featuring members of Brutal
Knights and School Jerks. These guys had a European-released 12" a
while back that sort of went under the radar, and this new EP is even
better. It definitely sounds more than a little like the Brutal
Knights in the way it has the intensity and speed of hardcore but the
catchiness of garage rock. However, Valley Boys (to me at least) are
just better than Brutal Knights... just writing more straightforward,
classic-sounding punk. If you're into like the Zero Boys / Carbonas /
Predator school of punk that exists right on the periphery of punk and
hardcore and really combines the best elements of both this is one you
definitely want to hear... recommended.

High Spirits: demos 12" (self-released)
Compilation of demo releases from this neo-NWOBHM band from Chicago.
These guys have been getting a bit of hype lately, and with good
reason... it's totally spot-on NWOBHM with a singer that can actually
sing and just a hint of those melodic Iron Maiden leads. This is
definitely one that the punks can get into as well, as everything is
tough, fast, and worthy of your fist pumps.

Gas Rag: Beats Off 12" (Beach Impediment)
Brand new 12" from perhaps the best straight up HC band in America
right now... you didn't think they'd go to 12" and drop a prog album
or something, did you? This is the same lightning-fast, rampaging
d-beat that you've come to expect based on their other two EPs...
sometimes this type of thing doesn't work on a 12", but I've got no
qualms here... 100% raging.

Various: Winds of Change 7" (React!)
Anyone into straight edge hardcore knows that React! is one of the
most on-point labels around... the sound, style, and packaging are
always pure Revelation Records circa 1988, so it's unsurprising that
they can put together such a strong comp of new sxe bands. Includes
gorgeous packaging as well, including a cool obi-style strip. Features
songs from Safe and Sound, Enough, Word on the Street, Violence to
Fade, Tied Down, and Wrong Idea.

Personnel: S/T 7" (Doubledotdash)
Debut EP from this new English band that features a couple of former
Shitty Limits. Of all of the many post-Limits bands, this is probably
the one that sounds the most like them... it's got that trademark
heavy Wire influence, and the standout track here, "Hysteria," is as
good as anything the Limits ever wrote. It's no secret that I'm
completely in love with the people behind this band / scene, but
honestly this is one of the standout records that I've heard lately,
and if you liked the Shitty Limits at all you NEED this. I promise.

Misled Youth: S/T 7" (Society Bleeds)
Debut 7" from this super young band from DC who have a clear fondness
for the Revelation Records classics... while not quite as powerful as,
say, Youth of Today, this packs a similar sort of punch to Bold, Wide
Awake, Up Front, etc., and is honestly probably better than a couple
of those bands. Solid, straight up youth crew hardcore.

Hard Skin: Gypsy Rose 7" (self-released)
A new Hard Skin single! What is there to say about this really? No
current oi! band is their equal in terms of writing banger after
banger, and you get two more here... the b-side, "Someone Like You,"
is everything I want oi! to be. So killer.

Nabat: Scenderemo Nelle Strade 7" (Bootleg)
Unofficial reissue of this inept Italian oi! classic. Definitely
rickety, these guys are more of the Red Alert school of really
rickety, almost shambolic oi! that somehow manages to have some
interesting melodies and riffs rise out of the din. If your tastes
skew toward the raw, inept, and weird, this is a record you probably
want to know.

Archaic: Noise in Your Head 7" (La Vida Es Un Mus)
Debut 7" from this new European band featuring Guillem from Destino
Final, Marco from Smart Cops, as well as some other key players I'm
sure. I didn't really know what to expect from this, but it is
AWESOME. It's not really d-beat as such... though that's definitely an
influence and you'll recognize Guillem's vocals immediately, it sounds
more akin to heavy hardcore like Hoax. And, like the best of those
bands, the production here is absolutely monstrous... a bass-heavy
roar that will make your entire house quake. A total fist-pumper...
highly recommended.

Protomartyr: Under Color of Official Right 12" (Sub Pop)
Like a lot of people, I absolutely loved this band's earlier stuff,
and I was somewhat taken aback when I heard this LP. That voice and
those great lyrics were still there (and better than ever, in fact!)
but the big, cacaphonous sound of the band's earlier stuff was gone,
replaced with a sparse and spacey sound... it took a bit of
adjustment, but honestly I think this is way better than their older
stuff. The songs are way stronger, and the whole thing is just utterly
dynamic... it's just a brilliant record back to front. It reminds me
somewhat of Wire's transition from Pink Flag to Chairs Missing. If you
can hang with that change, you can certainly hang with this...
seriously, one of the year's best records so far.

Bored Youth: Are You Alive 12" (Alona's Dream)
More archival midwest hardcore from Alona's Dream Records. This time
around it's a full LP worth of material from the highly underrated
Bored Youth. My friend Scott described the a-side as "a real period
piece," and I totally agree. Really, these guys would kind of fit with
the middling bands on the Flex Your Head comp, but I just love the
sound and vibe of those early Dischord and Touch and Go bands so much
that I can't help but fall for this stuff. This also has a live set on
the b-side, and while it's well-recorded and the band deliver a
powerful performance, the mic sounds like it's next to the door guy so
I find myself listening more to his conversations than the band.
Still, if you're one of those people who want to hear every scrap of
music from this era, this is well worth your while. Includes super
nice packaging including screen printed jackets and clear vinyl.

Confront: Trace: Early Years Selection 12" (General Speech)
Compilation of demo-only releases from this Japanese band who
previously released a 7" on General Speech. Straight up burning
spirits style... this sounds almost exactly like Death Side, though
the leads aren't quite as epic and awe-inspiring as Chelsea's (but
whose are?). If you dig Forward and early Crude this is a solid
collection that you'll want to hear.

Making a Scene: NYHC 85-88 book
Reprint of this great book of photographs and anecdotes about the 80s
NYHC hardcore scene. While there are a lot of little anecdotes and
remembrances, the centerpiece of this book is the photographs, which
are uniformly excellent. About half of the book is live photos of the
bands you'd expect (Youth of Today, Warzone, Absolution, Nausea, etc.,
as well as some touring bands like Dag Nasty), but the real treat is
the other half of the book, which is mostly people from the scene
hanging out. I just love seeing all of the fashions and how people
lived... it's not only a document of an important scene, but also an
era of New York that's pretty much entirely gone. Highly recommended.

Ugly Parts: Wet cassette (Bleeding Edges)
New cassette from this New Jersey band and it pretty much perfectly
fits in with the rest of the Bleeding Edges roster (Protester, Altered
Boys, the Flex, etc.). Like those bands, there's definitely a lot of
the X-Claim! Records influence, but there are some weird little parts
to Ugly Parts as well, and those are my favorites. They're fleeting,
but there's a kind of creepy vibe that reminds me of My America-era
FU's, perhaps even approaching a bit of Rudimentary Peni in some
parts. Regardless, this is a banger... if you like hardcore you need
to hear this.

Pleasure Industry: demo cassette (self-released)
Pro-printed demo tape from this new NYC band. Man, this is a
banger... on the one hand this reminds me of the more "accessible" end
of the NYC punk scene like Parquet Courts and Family Curse, but this
is also a lot heavier and noisier than those bands... I feel like
there's a shade of Nirvana in their sound, but at times this can
almost meet Pollution-like levels of heavy, catchy bliss. Strong,
catchy, and totally punk... what more can you ask for?

Frau: demo cassette (Tuff Enuff)
Demo tape from this new London band featuring at least one member of
Good Throb. This actually reminds me a bit of the Good Throb 7"s in
that the songs are very bass-led with the guitars kind of serving to
accent parts of riffs. The drums also have that slightly off-kilter
punk/post-punk sound, and the vibe taken as a whole is sort of like a
modernized, more punk take on the DIY aesthetic of early Rough Trade
bands like the Fall and Delta 5. Pretty much everything coming out of
this London scene is straight fire, and this demo is no different.
Highly recommended.

Trenches: 2013 demo cassette (self-released)
Demo tape from this new San Francisco HC band featuring a member of
Replica. This is tough, mean, and burly hardcore... reminds me of
Warthog, Mercy Killings, and Caged Animal in the way that it takes
that classic Poison Idea influence and makes it just a tad heavier and
more modern. This has an absolutely huge recording, way better than
most bands' vinyl releases... this is one to watch... people are going
to be jocking this band hard soon.

Regimen: Upprepning Ar Ofrankomlig cassette (Not Normal)
Tape release from this new Swedish HC band. The label's description
references Amde Petersen's Arme and I definitely get that... there's a
similar take on catchy, early 80s USHC and the songs are high-energy
and super fun. The vocals are quite high-pitched, which gives this a
really youthful feel that I like to hear from this style of music. If
you dig that Kick N Punch records, early 00s K-Town sound you'd be
well-served to pick this up.

American Hate: S/T cassette (Not Normal)
Demo tape from this band out of Oklahoma featuring members of Glow
God, whose LP I loved. Unlike Glow God, though, this is straight HC...
however, it's hardcore that's dynamic, interesting, and well-played.
This has a real early 80s feel, reminding me of classics by bands like
Mecht Mensch as well as more contemporary stuff like Glue. There's
also some interesting things happening in the songwriting and
arrangements that makes me think of the early, more hardcore Shitty
Limits stuff... I know those references are all over the place, but I
think that speaks to how well-written and interesting this demo is.
Can't wait to hear more from this band. Also, I should note that this
comes with a zine-sized lyric booklet and an American Hate-branded
shiv.

Protester: 7" promo cassette (Bleeding Edges)
Four-song promo cassette from DC's Protestor, which is the one-man
band from Connor Donnegan (Last Words, Double Negative, Red Death,
etc.). Two new straight up HC rippers on the a-side and two exclusive
Agnostic Front covers on the b-side. This definitely displays a hearty
influence from Violent Reaction, but unlike a lot of bands who go for
that oi!-inflected HC sound, Protester can hang with the big dawgs.
Looking forward to that 7"!

Gutter Gods: Innersense 12" (self-released)
I think that I saw this described somewhere as "space oi!," which was
a description that I found immensely intriguing. While Gutter Gods
aren't quite as out there as that genre descriptor would imply, this
is some interesting stuff. They've cleaned up quite a lot since the
demo tape we had a few years back, adding a heavy dose of chorus on
the guitar (which is quite uncommon for an oi! band, and I guess where
the "space" thing comes from). Ultimately, though, I think this will
appeal most to fans of the oi!/HC sound that's been quite popular over
the past few years with bands like Violent Future, Violent Reaction,
Night Stalker, etc. Really cool packaging on this one, too, including
metallic silver foil covers.

In School: Praxis of Hate 7" (Kill Test)
Long-awaited debut EP from these 4 New York ladies, and it's a beast.
I think the last time I saw them they covered "Power" by Agnostic
Front, and that should give you a pretty good idea of where they're
coming from musically, though the Die Kreuzen reference in their name
is also a bit apt as there are some fancy little doodly-dahs on the
guitar. Really, though, this is just straightforward,
go-for-the-throat hardcore with passion and drive. Love the artwork on
this one too!

Flesh World: S/T 12" (La Vida Es Un Mus)
Debut 12" from this San Francisco band who (I believe) features
members of Needles and Talk Is Poison. I've heard these guys kind of
grouped in with the neo-post-punk sound, but this isn't chorus pedal
and eyeliner music... rather, Flesh World sound to me like a punk
version of a 90s Creation Records band. They have those big, noisy,
yet melodic guitars and a great female vocalist, but their songs have
the energy and power that you'd expect from people who came up through
the hardcore scene. It's a little bit subtle and understated so may
not knock you out on the first listen, but I've been going back to
this LP again and again.

Good Throb: Fuck Off 12" (Sabermetric)
This is straight up one of the most exciting releases I've come
across in some time. I liked Good Thob's previous 7"s... they were a
bit rickety, super angry and super punk, but they take it to an
entirely new level on this LP. There's a dash more melody in the
guitars in particular now, and the bright and clear production really
delivers the strength and power of these songs. As before, the lyrics
are almost startlingly direct yet incredibly eloquent... these are
lyrics that actually made me think about myself, my beliefs and my
behavior, and when was the last time you could say that about a punk
record? Simply put, everything about this from the songs to the
performance to the recording to the packaging is just so utterly
perfect and exactly what I want punk to be in 2014. Get this or pose
hard.

Predator: The Complete Earth 12" (Scavenger of Death)
Their first 12" was solid Atlanta garage that occasionally flirted
with HC tempos, but this new LP from Predator is something else. They
seem to be taking cues from their buds in GG King in pushing that
classic, basic, catchy Atlanta punk sound into completed uncharted
waters... like GG, they even flirt with a little black metal influence
here and there, but it doesn't sound so heavy-handed here as it did on
Esoteric Lore... basically, this is as catchy, memorable, and
interesting a punk LP as I've heard so far in 2014... recommended.

Black Boot: demo cassette (Toxic State)
More gnarly HC punk from the Toxic State camp... ramshackle drums,
crazy vocals, and the early Italian HC spirit that made me fall in
love with bands like Crazy Spirit and Dawn of Humans in the first
place. If you follow this label, you already know you need this.

Deformity: demo cassette (Toxic State)
Deformity didn't storm out of the gate like a lot of the other NYC /
Toxic State bands... their earlier releases were solid, but lacked a
little something. However, the band has continued to grow and evolve,
and after they had my favorite song on last year's Ground Zero
Hardcore comp LP on Toxic State I was stoked to hear what they would
do next. This new tape definitely fulfills the promise of that
material, with raw, blistering hardcore punk that has a bit of the
swagger of Stooges-influenced garage without any of the flaming hot
rod bs that mars a lot of that genre. It's a similar sensibility to
Hank Wood in that this kind of sounds garage but also clearly isn't
garage... it just has all of the catchiness and drive of early punk.
Highly recommended.

Section Urbane: The Final Program 7" (540)
The final release in 540 Records' series of reissues from 70s
Brisbane punk labels Shake Music and Savage Music is this four-song EP
from Section Urbane. Having released two previous singles of quirky
punk as Just Urbain, the Brisbane band continued their unique
Velvets-through-the-lens-of-Joy-Division approach through the name
change, harnessing a fuller, more bass-heavy sound on their final
recording session. The track, =E2=80=9CI'd Rather Stay Home And Watch =
TV,=E2=80=9D
still has more than its fair share of the Aussie-garage stomp of bands
like the Chosen Few and the Victims, but after that it=E2=80=99s all about
Mo Tucker beats, dark and poetic lyrics delivered with a distinctly
Lou Reed-influenced drawl, and heavy, melodic Peter Hook-style bass
lines. If you want to hear first-gen-DIY naivet=C3=A9, post-punk artistic
ambition and the party-hearty sensibility of the original Murder Punk
bands clash together into something wholly unique, get this on your
turntable right away.

Back to Back: Narcissist 7" (540)
2nd EP from this Houston band, and damn does it slay... I feel like
when you play this kind of straight up, 80s-style hardcore you either
have it or your don't, and Back to Back most certainly have it. It
sounds quite a bit like the recent 7"s from Glue and DiE, two bands
I've been obsessing over recently... time to add another one to the
pile I guess!

Skem=C3=A4ta: demo cassette (Sorry State)
After the demise of Stripmines in the summer of 2012, Jeff Young
(guitar) and Alex Taylor (bass) kept writing songs, looking for the
perfect lineup to keep pushing forward their unique brand of raw,
fast, and technical hardcore. Eventually recruiting Cameron Craig
(Logic Problem, Double Negative, Davidians) on drums and Usman on
vocals, Skem=C3=A4ta started playing shows in late 2013 and were
immediately a force to be reckoned with. Fans of Stripmines will
certainly love them, but Skem=C3=A4ta incorporates a bunch of new
influences as well, like the subtle melodic qualities of Sickoids and
the rawer, more direct hardcore of bands like Framtid and Bastard.
Watch for a debut LP from these guys on Sorry State later this summer.
This release is limited to 150 copies with 2-sided, screen printed
j-cards, pro-duplicated tapes and download code.

Narcoman: demo cassette (Sorry State)
When Raleigh=E2=80=99s Cross Laws broke up in 2007, Matt and Daniel went =
on
to form Devour, but Dennis (bass and vocals) took an entirely
different path, serving two years as part of the Peace Corps in
Turkmenistan and then returning to North Carolina to be a high school
teacher in Asheville. While he wasn=E2=80=99t actively playing in any =
bands,
Dennis had his guitar with him through this entire period, crafting
and refining a huge backlog on songs. In the summer of 2013 Dennis got
together with fellow Cross Laws alumnus Daniel as well as Cameron
Craig (Logic Problem, Double Negative, Skem=C3=A4ta) on drums to make raw
4-track recordings of 4 of these songs. The results are quite a bit
different from Cross Laws=E2=80=A6 more complex, refined, melodic, and
subtle, Narcoman recalls the best of ambitious, catchy 80s hardcore
like Articles of Faith, early Husker Du, and Upright Citizens. This
release is limited to 150 copies with a screen-printed j-card,
pro-duplicate tapes and download code.

Alright folks, welcome back! It's been a busy, busy month around Sorry =
State HQ. We had our very first Record Store Day since we opened the shop, =
I finished up my job as an English professor (perhaps never to return?), =
we tabled the great Damaged City fest in DC, booked and played a bunch of =
shows and generally didn't sleep very much or eat very well. I'm hoping =
that May is a lot calmer, but if not that's fine because I'm loving doing =
all of this.<br><br>
As I've mentioned before, things have been pretty quiet on the label front =
since the shop opened, but it looks like we'll be back into full swing =
with a full slate of releases this summer. A lot of these projects have =
been in the works for a while, and as tends to happen in punk it looks =
like all of them will be finished at just about the same time. So goodbye =
money, hello awesome punk. Here's a run-down of what this summer should =
bring:<br><br>
The first thing to surface will likely be the demo cassette from a band =
from Greensboro, North Carolina called <b>Wriggle</b>. I saw these guys =
live once a few months ago and they were great... I think one of the =
members was wearing an Appendix t-shirt (which is a quick way to my =
heart), but their music was great... just pure hardcore in the North =
Carolina tradition, i.e. heavy, unpretentious and ever so slightly =
metallic. I've been trying to get them back to Raleigh ever since then but =
it just hasn't worked out, but a few of them showed up to the Government =
Flu show earlier this month and were handing out demos for free. I took =
one and was blown away... the production is totally raw and perfect, and =
the vocals are adolescent angst personified... it's like this stuff was =
left off of the <i>No Core</i> comp by accident. At any rate, I thought =
that this demo needed to be heard by more than just 50 people, so we'll be =
making another run so all of you can hear yet another great band from =
North Carolina.<br><br>
Speaking of great bands from NC, Jeff's band <b>Skem&auml;ta</b> just =
recorded their debut LP for Sorry State. I've heard the rough mixes and =
they sound incredible... it has much heavier, clearer production than the =
demo and in some ways the band's roots in Stripmines are even more =
apparent because of that, but this thing is just chock full of little =
earworm riffs and melodies that I think will really turn heads.<br><br>
Also in the NC punk department, <b>Whatever Brains</b> are just about done =
recording their new record. They actually released a tour CDR that you can =
grab in the webstore that features unmastered versions of four songs that =
will be on the LP. This record has kind of a funny backstory. I was =
telling Rich that lots of people like the Brains when they hear them, but =
their long-ish LPs don't really suit the attention span of the digital =
age, so I suggested that maybe they should do a shorter 12" EP next. Rich =
seemed to think that was a good idea (or at least he humored me), but I =
guess it just wasn't in them, because this is now going to be Sorry =
State's first double LP. The center-piece (which takes up two sides of the =
record) is a 30-minute "rock opera" that has been blowing my mind ever =
since I started to hear it coming together in early demos. We're still =
working on how this thing is going to be put together, but the idea is to =
make it as close to the price of a single LP as we possibly can, because =
selling the punks on a double-LP with a 30-minute song on it is going to =
be tough enough as it is, but true Brains fans know that this is by far =
their most exciting stuff to date.<br><br>
One more item of interest for people who follow the North Carolina scene: =
the details of this are still coming together, but I may as well let the =
cat out of the bag that I'm working on doing a monthly singles series of =
all North Carolina bands. There won't be subscriptions because those =
inevitably result in disappointment and/or frustration, but the plan is, =
starting late summer 2014, to release one two-song single a month by a =
great North Carolina band. The first release will be from =
<b>Davidians</b>, a new band featuring three guys who did time in Double =
Negative along with Colin from Formaldehyde Junkies / Safewords / =
Voight/Kampff. Davidians actually have a 7" coming out on Deranged in May, =
but you can already listen to it <a =
href=3D"http://t.ymlp342.net/uhwazaujbyjadaybaraeuem/click.php">here</a>. =
We have a bunch of other bands already confirmed for the singles series, =
including <b>No Love</b>, <b>Skem&auml;ta</b>, <b>Black Zinfandel</b>, and =
probably more than I'm forgetting. There are more than enough great bands =
in this state to keep this going for at least a year, but we'll see how it =
goes. More details on that as it comes together I suppose.<br><br>
Now we move out of NC to the great state of Missouri, where we find that =
<b>Dark Ages</b> has finally finished their long-awaited follow-up to =
<i>Can America Survive?</i>, which is currently being mastered. It has =
been many moons since that phenomenal LP, and Dark Ages have changed quite =
a bit, incorporating subtlety and atmosphere that only serve to make the =
moments of breakneck hardcore even more powerful.<br><br>
Staying in the midwest, <b>Broken Prayer</b> also just completed laying =
down tracks for the follow-up to their debut LP. I haven't heard anything =
yet and I know they have a long mixing process ahead of them, but Broken =
Prayer are one of the best bands in the world right now and I'm confident =
that this new LP is going to be even better than their phenomenal first =
LP.<br><br>
Our final upcoming release announcement is the debut LP from Japan's =
<b>Louder</b>. I was introduced to Louder by Tsubasa from Rough Kids, who =
says Louder are his favorite Japanese punk band since Teengenerate. =
There's definitely more than a little bit of the raw Japanese garage-punk =
of bands like Teengenerate and the Registrators in Louder's sound, but =
they also have a subtle melodicism that immediately calls to mind the =
mighty Rough Kids themselves. If you're curious as to what they sound =
like, you can check out their 2nd single on Japan's Episode Sounds label =
<a =
href=3D"http://t.ymlp342.net/uhqataujbyjapaybataeuem/click.php">here</a>, =
and sometime in May I should also have some distro copies of that single =
so everyone can get a little more familiar with Sorry State's newest =
band.<br><br>
That should keep us more than busy (not to mention broke) for the summer. =
There are also rumblings of upcoming recording sessions from Joint D&ne; =
and Rough Kids, so the fun won't stop there.<br><br>
One more note before I get to the distro stuff. Jeff and I have a new band =
called Prosthesis that started playing shows this month. It's the first =
time I've played straight up hardcore in a while and it's been a blast. If =
you're curious what we've been up to, here's a video from our second =
show... in typically confounding North Carolina hardcore fashion we start =
off with a 3-minute epic based off of a mid-20th century classical =
symphony. That's how we do. Anyway, thanks so Will from To Live a Lie =
Records for filming this!<br><br>

Hey Sorry State Readers!<br><br>
It's been a crazy last few weeks.
Record Store Day had a whole bunch of new stuff coming through the doors, =
but there's a lot of killer new releases besides those.
First of all, the new Gas Rag LP has to be one of the best straight up =
hardcore punk records I've heard in a long time.
As always, Man In Decline is putting out some great stuff, like the =
American pressings of Damaged Head and the Vanna Inget LPs.
I also can't say enough how much I've been enjoying the Elsinores 12", =
it's like if H&uuml;sker D&uuml; were a dream-pop band or =
something.<br><br>
The last few weekends have been super busy for me.
Mercy Killings played Damaged City, which was a great time with lots of =
cool bands.
Thanks again to Nick and Chris for asking us to play!
Mercy Killings also just got done recording for our 2nd EP, and I think =
it's gonna turn out great.
That should be out some time late Summer.<br><br>
Skem&auml;ta also just recorded for our LP that should be out on Sorry =
State (hopefully) by the end of Summer as well.
Thanks to everyone who's grabbed a copy of the demo!
Also wanted to mention that we're still pulling them together, but we =
should be playing our first string of shows out of town at the end of May, =
so keep an eye out! <br><br>
Thanks for reading!<br>
-Jeff </td>

Hey everyone,<br><br>
It&rsquo;s been a great month for music.
First off I am a little late on this because we sold out of them before I =
got the chance to listen to it, but the Earth Girls Demo is amazing and we =
got a couple of more copies so get it before we sell out again.
It is the ideal warm weather music.
There are so many good things coming out of London at the moment.
The Good Throb LP will probably be on most everyone&rsquo;s lists this =
month.
It is punk at it&rsquo;s best.
The Frau tape is more good snotty British stuff.
The one that I have a hard time not listening to on repeat though is =
Personnel&rsquo;s Ep.
Featuring two Ex-Shitty Limits (who have switched roles) it still has a =
lot of the feel of The Limits.
I for some reason have had a hard time really pinning it down and =
describing it (which I&rsquo;m terrible at anyways).
So just go read Daniel&rsquo;s description, I&rsquo;m sure he has said =
what I&rsquo;m trying to say very directly and eloquently.
Or maybe just skip it all and get the record.
In short this record is amazing and you should own it.
<br><br>
Much like everyone else I&rsquo;m really into the Gas Rag LP and am glad =
the Demo got released as a 7&rdquo;.
The Achtungs 7&rdquo; has been blowing me away.
The vocals remind me of a less polished Carbonas with a very blown out and =
bass heavy backing track.
Going Underground also re-released The Terrorist 7&rdquo;, which is =
drum-machine KBD punk at it&rsquo;s best.
I&rsquo;m sure not for everyone, but I&rsquo;m into it. <br><br>
I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve forgotten a million things I wanted to mention =
but that seems like a good start. (oh yeah and there&rsquo;s more Black =
Zinfandel tapes in the store!)<br><br>
-Seth

Seth and Jeff were right that this has been a great month for new =
releases, but for me two of them stand head and shoulders above all the =
others: the new LPs from Good Throb and Protomartyr. Not only did I get to =
see both of these bands live this past month, but I've played both of =
these records so much that I'm pretty sure they'll evoke memories of April =
2014 for a long time to come. The bad news is that, in true Sorry State =
fashion, both of these are sold out at the moment, but we have a restock =
of Good Throb on the way that should be here early this week and more =
Protomartyr LPs shouldn't be too far behind. Speaking of the problem with =
stuff being sold out, I keep talking about making this newsletter =
bi-weekly rather than monthly... I feel like these are so long they're =
cumbersome and lots of stuff is sold out by the time I send this out, so =
maybe now that this is my only full-time job I will get on making that =

Of course there's a TON of other great stuff in this month as well. You =
guys really love Gas Rag, and unfortunately both the 12" and demo 7" are =
sold out (more 12"s should be here Tuesday or Wednesday hopefully), but =
you should prioritize getting those when they're in because both rip. I'm =
also completely in love with the Personnel 7"... it features a couple of =
ex-Shitty Limits, and of all of the post-Limits projects that have come =
out in the past few years this is the one that sounds most like the Limits =
themselves. I've also been giving a lot of spins to the great Flesh World =
LP, the new Perspex Flesh LP, the new Proxy single, the In School EP, the =
Violent Outburst EP, the Crown Court demo, both Warthog EPs, the S.H.I.T. =
EP, the Lowest Form LP, the Common Market demo, the Achtungs EP, the new =
Hard Skin single, the Frau demo, the Predator LP (temporarily out of stock =
as well... sorry!), the new Deformity tape (which SLAYS!), and all the new =
jams on 540 Records. It's a long list, but all of the things I just =
mentioned are top-shelf ragers!<br><br>

1. Deformity: new tape (Toxic State)<br>

Defiant Pose #8 zine w/Rema Rema 7"<br>
Latest issue of this great UK zine... they don't really make them like =
this (at least not too much) anymore... an old-school music fanzine with a =
totally cut-and-paste layout and real depth to the content. This time =
around you get interviews with Rema-Rema, Heretics, Stench, Cervix, and =
Blood & Roses. However, the real treat here is a 7" featuring unreleased =
material from first-wave UK post-punk band Rema Rema. The 7" is totally =
rad... simple, heavy drum machine punk that has a bit of the anarcho vibe =
of bands like the Mob, but with the pulsing, almost dance-y vibe of the =
Normal or Killing Joke. The production, though, is raw and the bass sound =
in particular is really heavy, making this a lot more aggressive and punk =
than a lot of other stuff in this vein.<br><br>

Infernoh / Nomad: Split 7" (Brain Solvent Propaganda)<br>
Split 7" between these two noisy hardcore powerhouses released for their =
recent east coast US tour. Infernoh are from Sweden and have that early =
Totalit&auml;r sound down pat... their tracks here are a little more raw =
and noisy than their most recent EP, and I think it's all the better for =
it. As for NYC's Nomad, I was excited to hear this since their previous =
12" on Toxic State really blew me away. The mastering on their side of the =
split isn't quite as ear-splittingly raw as the 12", but the band's total =
Disclose style shines through clearly, with a bit more emphasis on the =
vocals this time around. You can't do much better than this for a split of =
noisy, nasty d-beat!<br><br>

S.H.I.T.: <i>Collective Unconsciousness</i> 7" (Iron Lung)<br>
After a couple of absolutely killer tapes and one of the most powerhouse =
live shows around here's the debut 7" from Toronto's S.H.I.T. If you =
haven't heard them before, this is just straight up, nasty, noisy =
hardcore... you get the impression that S.H.I.T. aren't going for a =
particular style, they're just playing good old fashioned =
four-on-the-floor hardcore and there are few bands doing it better. If you =
dig stuff like Gas Rag, Gag, or Warthog this is one that needs to be in =
your collection. Beautiful packaging on this one too.<br><br>

Warthog: <i>Prison</i> 7" (Iron Lung)<br>
2nd EP from this great NYC band, apparently recorded during the same =
session as their debut on Katorga Works. As on that record, Warthog play =
pulverizing hardcore in the <i>Pick Your King</i> tradition with slightly =
high-pitched, incredibly aggressive vocals. This almost has a Cleveland =
(i.e. Gordon Solie, Puncture Wound, etc.) vibe to me in places... it's =
just so fast, gnarly, and nihilistic. Top-notch hardcore here.<br><br>

The Lowest Form: <i>Negative Ecstasy</i> 12" (Iron Lung)<br>
One of my most anticipated releases of 2014 is finally here! I absolutely =
loved the Lowest Form's previous demo and 7", and this 12" absolutely does =
not disappoint. Of course the Lowest Form are probably most famous in punk =
circles for featuring Paco Mus (of La Vida Es Un Mus Discos, otherwise =
known as the most trusted man in punk), so you know that he's not going to =
bring any weak shit to the table. Indeed, this LP is all power... raw, =
noisy, but with little bits of melody peeking through from time to time to =
keep you interested. I suppose this fits in broadly with other noisy, =
not-insanely-fast hardcore bands like Hoax or Perspex Flesh, but there's a =
kind of artiness to their approach that really separates the Lowest Form =
from the pack. Highly recommended if you love forward-thinking =
hardcore.<br><br>

Demonbrother: <i>Beyond the Veil</i> 12" (Iron Lung)<br>
I have to say that these days I'm pretty much 100% over anything that gets =
labeled power violence, but if anyone can bring me to the table to check =
something out it's Iron Lung Records. I have to say, though, I doubt I =
would have called this debut LP from Demonbrother power violence if the =
label hadn't mentioned that in their description... there's almost no =
blasting (maybe there isn't any at all), and the "noise" bits (i.e. the =
parts that don't rely on a standard drums-and-guitar setup) are at least =
as important (if not more) as the more straightforward bashing. I suppose =
you could call this power violence, but it's much more in line with Man Is =
the Bastard / Bastard Noise than the Crossed Out-influenced style that =
most modern bands try to cop. So if that's your bag I'd recommend picking =
this up, because you know Iron Lung is only going to bring you the best of =
the best.<br><br>

Crown Court: <i>Trouble from London demo</i> cassette (Quality Control =
HC)<br>
Demo tape from this new London band on the impeccable Quality Control HC =
label. This isn't really HC, but it definitely keeps with the theme of =
quality control because it absolutely rules. Crown Court are an oi! band, =
but it seems like most of the bands with an oi!-influenced sound these =
days tend to mix that influence with American hardcore (think Violent =
Future, Violent Reaction, etc.); however, Crown Court are straight up, =
melodic oi!. They bear more than a passing resemblance to a certain band =
who started as a great rootsy rock band and later turned into the most =
famous bonehead band in the world (hint: they're named after a common =
tool)... there's definitely some rocked-out riffing and leads, and the =
vocals are just perfect... hoarse and catchy, belting out simple melodies =
you can chant on your next trip down to the football stadium. The oi! =
trend is definitely starting to run a little dry, but this is completely =
different and wholly invigorating. Highly recommended.<br><br>

Violent Outburst: <i>Survival Signs</i> 7" (Agitated)<br>
Posthumous 7" from this short-lived Virginia / North Carolina band. They =
have kind of a complicated history... they kicked around Raleigh for a =
very long time with various lineups (I even recorded an early unreleased =
demo for them), played very few shows, but always seemed right on the =
verge of being incredible. Two years ago I finally caught them live, and =
then all of a sudden they had broken up, half of their lineup (and one of =
their songs) absorbed into Mercy Killings. I'm really glad that this =
4-song 7" is seeing the light of day because it totally rips... it's =
really a completely different beast from Mercy Killings, much more =
mid-paced and the vocals are considerably harsher. It definitely reminds =
me of the more mid-paced Wasted Time stuff (the hand of Zach Pearce is all =
over this thing), but fused with the toughness of the <i>New Breed</i> =
comp. Definitely a complete banger, and topped off with a totally classy =
layout to boot. Recommended.<br><br>

Perspex Flesh: S/T 12" (Static Shock)<br>
Long-awaited debut LP from this band out of Leeds, England. Their previous =
7" on Video Disease was great and the LP totally tops it. I still feel =
like Perspex Flesh bear at least a passing resemblance to Hoax in that =
their songs tend to trudge along at this really menacing tempo, but =
Perspex Flesh is a lot less stripped down. The sound is really chaotic but =
at the same time melodic, especially for a hardcore band. This is probably =
an out-there reference given the fact that these guys are a hardcore band, =
but the way melodies emerge out of the noisy din actually reminds me a bit =
of Shoppers at points, though you can tell these guys have probably paid a =
lot of attention to their Rudimentary Peni records as well. As you can =
probably tell by how all over the place these references are, this is a =
pretty original-sounding LP and definitely one of the best hardcore =
records of late. Strongly recommended.<br><br>
Note: If you run a store or a distro and you're looking to grab some of =
these Sorry State is helping to distribute them in the US, so get in touch =
for wholesale rates.<br><br>

Death: <i>Leprosy</i> 12" (Relapse)<br>
Oh boy, am I excited about this one. I'm not a huge death metal guy, but =
the stuff I really like I <i>really</i> like, and I <i>really</i> like =
Death. Sometimes I feel like death metal can be (somewhat by design) kind =
of a boring genre, but Death are just so relentlessly catchy, which is =
weird because the intricacy of their riffs and tempo changes often gets =
them labeled as kind of a "prog-y" death metal band. I love that aspect of =
the band (i.e. they have riffs for MILES), but really it's the catchiness =
that keeps me coming back again and again, and if you're not screaming =
"PULL THE PLUG" along with the band then you probably have no soul (and =
not in the good way). Thankfully this is a totally faithful reissue, =
replicating the original artwork and track listing and featuring solid, =
powerful mastering. If you have only 5 metal records in your collection =
one of them should probably be either <i>Scream Bloody Gore</i> or =
<i>Leprosy</i>, so get on it.<br><br>

Common Market: demo cassette (Vile Audio)<br>
Demo tape from this project out of Charlotte, NC featuring two members of =
No Power and Stepdad SS doing something a lot more unique and weird. This =
is definitely hardcore (it's raw, loud and fast), but where No Power and =
Stepdad SS are kind of genre exercises, Common Market seems to have a much =
looser, more creative approach. I feel like this is more in line with =
genre-bending hardcore like the Crucifucks, the Feederz, Saccharine Trust, =
etc. If it were just a little more ramshackle it might also sound like it =
could come from the Toxic State camp... so yeah, this is hardcore that's =
interesting and progressive but still totally punk, just like I like =
it.<br><br>

Absolut: <i>Punk Survival</i> 12" (Electric Assault)<br>
Debut 12" from this Toronto crust band, and it's totally over the top in =
the best way possible. The production is heavy and metallic, reminding me =
a bit of <i>Scandinavian Jawbreaker</i>-era Anti-Cimex, but the vibe is =
totally different from that record. I always thought of the mid-period =
Cimex stuff as being very controlled and contained records, but this =
record (despite having really clear, almost metallic production) just =
sounds <i>wild</i>, like the band are having an absolutely great time =
recording it... listening to this I can't help but think of heaps of =
crusties all slammed to the front of the stage, pumping their beers in the =
air and having a great time. It's weird that a band can pull that off =
without coming off like a lame, contrived "party band." I must admit I'm =
not totally sold on the heavily distorted and delayed vocals, but the =
music is just so explosive and raging that it's impossible not to love =
this.<br><br>

Actungs: S/T 7" (Going Underground)<br>
Man, I NEVER would have guessed that this record was by a new band... =
everything about it from the layout to the production and the songwriting =
screams Europe circa '79... it's just absolutely perfect in every regard. =
They remind me a lot of Ivy Green (particularly the high-pitched yet =
melodic vocals) or the Lost Kids, but with the totally raw production of a =
US KBD band. If this thing had actually come out in the '70s it would =
probably be one of the best-regarded records of the era, and it's still a =
total breath of fresh air now. I just can't get over how perfect this =
sounds without sounding the least bit contrived or retro. Also, I could =
totally see a band like this dropping a two-song single, but there are six =
songs here and they are all snotty punk scorchers. Seriously, get this... =
my mind is blown!<br><br>

The Terrorists: <i>Crazy Life</i> 7" (Going Underground)<br>
Reissue of this uber-rarity from early 80s Bakersfield, California. When I =
say uber-rarity I mean it... apparently there are only around 50 copies of =
this in circulation and I don't even want to think of what one might sell =
for. As for the music, it's totally simple, gnarly punk with a drum =
machine. They don't really push the drum machine angle... it's fairly low =
in the mix, and could probably be mistaken for a live drummer if you =
weren't paying to much attention. The riffs are simple, aggressive, and =
distorted, reminding me a bit of the early Metal Urbain stuff, but there =
are some interesting vocal harmonies that hint at what some of the UKDIY =
bands were doing a few years earlier. It almost sounds to me like =
Television Personalities or O-Level if, instead of being obsessed with the =
Jam and Syd Barrett, were instead really into the early Riot City Records. =
Definitely a period piece, but one of interest to fans of raw early US =
punk.<br><br>

Future Punx: <i>Livin' in a Movie</i> 7" (Dull Tools)<br>
Debut single from this Brooklyn band who play dark, aggressive, =
synth-punk. The drum machine is right up front in a way that could =
associate them with dark, hard synth-punk bands like Total Control (well, =
tracks like "Paranoid Video" anyway) or the Normal, but the vocal and =
synth melodies are decidedly sunny, recalling MTV-era Devo or maybe a less =
distorted, less punk version of Le Shok. I'm a sucker for this synth-punk =
stuff as long as it's hard and aggressive, and this definitely fits the =
bill.<br><br>

Hero Dishonest: <i>Kaikki Hajoaa</i> 7" (Peterwalkee)<br>
Latest 7" from this Finnish band, and they still have a wild, almost =
indescribable sound (but here goes anyway...). There are elements of so =
much different stuff here... they're as fast as any hardcore band, but the =
riffing is really quirky and interesting, at points of reminding me of a =
much faster Drive Like Jehu or something like that. They actually do a =
cover of the Proletariat (but sung in Finnish), and I suppose that band is =
a pretty good reference point in how it's fast like hardcore, but =
something kind of vaguely post-punk about the way everything is put =
together. Like all of their other stuff, this is really good and terribly =
underrated in the US.<br><br>

Government Flu: <i>Tension</i> 12" (Refuse)<br>
Debut LP from this Polish hardcore band who have had a number of EP =
releases over the past few years. When these guys started I feel like they =
were very much in the No Way Records school of early 80s retro USHC, but =
they've progressed a lot since then... this LP has a lot more varied =
influences. The base is still early 80s USHC, but they aren't afraid of a =
mid-paced (dare I say it?) breakdown part, and the guitar tone is really =
interesting, with very little treble. At points it kind of reminds me of a =
more straightforward version of Hoax (but with snotty, higher-pitched =
vocals), or maybe even something more straight edge-sounding like the =
Flex. Regardless, this is definitely the band's strongest work yet and =
definitely recommended for 80s HC head.<br><br>
Note: While supplies last, we have the US tour version, which is on red =
vinyl and has what looks like a screen printed jacket.<br><br>

Proxy: <i>Slow Suicide</i> 7" (Ugly Pop)<br>
Brand new 7" from this much talked-about band from Canada that features =
former members of Inepsy. As on their previous records, their sound is a =
really intriguing mix of Inepsy's kind of rock-infused take on punk and a =
more traditional oi! sound. In fact, the a-side, "Slow Suicide," is =
probably the most oi! thing they've done... in fact, it's rock n roll =
guitar sound almost veers toward pub rock, but the choruses are pure =
terrace chant. That might sound like a criticism to some people, but I =
love it, and I think the band has a really interesting and unique sound. =
This is a band that just keeps getting better and better... highly =
recommended.<br><br>

SFH: <i>Mayor on Crack</i> 7" (Ugly Pop)<br>
Brand new single from this Toronto punk project that came together to =
"commemorate" all of the recent drama surrounding the city's notorious =
mayor. The main guy behind this project was in 70s Toronto punk band the =
Hot Nasties, and this single definitely sounds more like 70s punk than =
anything else. It kind of reminds me of "novelty" punk in that the song is =
kind of built around a lyric ("we've got a mayor on crack") and the rest =
of the song seems built around delivering that quip a bunch of times. The =
b-side is a shorter and even jokier song that's also about Rob ford. While =
this kind of thing can have a novel--maybe even throwaway--quality to it, =
there's something refreshing about hearing a band that isn't so =
self-serious and that is addressing something that's of the moment rather =
than the beaten-to-death "timeless" themes that most bands today tend to =
deal in. If this had a more retro look to the graphic design I could see =

Valley Boys: <i>Drone Attack</i> 7" (Ugly Pop)<br>
New 4-song EP from this Toronto band featuring members of Brutal Knights =
and School Jerks. These guys had a European-released 12" a while back that =
sort of went under the radar, and this new EP is even better. It =
definitely sounds more than a little like the Brutal Knights in the way it =
has the intensity and speed of hardcore but the catchiness of garage rock. =
However, Valley Boys (to me at least) are just better than Brutal =
Knights... just writing more straightforward, classic-sounding punk. If =
you're into like the Zero Boys / Carbonas / Predator school of punk that =
exists right on the periphery of punk and hardcore and really combines the =
best elements of both this is one you definitely want to hear... =
recommended.<br><br>

High Spirits: demos 12" (self-released)<br>
Compilation of demo releases from this neo-NWOBHM band from Chicago. These =
guys have been getting a bit of hype lately, and with good reason... it's =
totally spot-on NWOBHM with a singer that can actually sing and just a =
hint of those melodic Iron Maiden leads. This is definitely one that the =
punks can get into as well, as everything is tough, fast, and worthy of =
your fist pumps.<br><br>

Gas Rag: <i>Beats Off</i> 12" (Beach Impediment)<br>
Brand new 12" from perhaps the best straight up HC band in America right =
now... you didn't think they'd go to 12" and drop a prog album or =
something, did you? This is the same lightning-fast, rampaging d-beat that =
you've come to expect based on their other two EPs... sometimes this type =
of thing doesn't work on a 12", but I've got no qualms here... 100% =
raging.<br><br>

Anyone into straight edge hardcore knows that React! is one of the most =
on-point labels around... the sound, style, and packaging are always pure =
Revelation Records circa 1988, so it's unsurprising that they can put =
together such a strong comp of new sxe bands. Includes gorgeous packaging =

Personnel: S/T 7" (Doubledotdash)<br>
Debut EP from this new English band that features a couple of former =
Shitty Limits. Of all of the many post-Limits bands, this is probably the =
one that sounds the most like them... it's got that trademark heavy Wire =
influence, and the standout track here, "Hysteria," is as good as anything =
the Limits ever wrote. It's no secret that I'm completely in love with the =
people behind this band / scene, but honestly this is one of the standout =
records that I've heard lately, and if you liked the Shitty Limits at all =
you NEED this. I promise.<br><br>

these guys are more of the Red Alert school of really rickety, almost =

Archaic: <i>Noise in Your Head</i> 7" (La Vida Es Un Mus)<br>
Debut 7" from this new European band featuring Guillem from Destino Final, =
Marco from Smart Cops, as well as some other key players I'm sure. I =
didn't really know what to expect from this, but it is AWESOME. It's not =
really d-beat as such... though that's definitely an influence and you'll =
recognize Guillem's vocals immediately, it sounds more akin to heavy =
hardcore like Hoax. And, like the best of those bands, the production here =
is absolutely <i>monstrous</i>... a bass-heavy roar that will make your =
entire house quake. A total fist-pumper... highly recommended.<br><br>

Protomartyr: <i>Under Color of Official Right</i> 12" (Sub Pop)<br>
Like a lot of people, I absolutely loved this band's earlier stuff, and I =
was somewhat taken aback when I heard this LP. That voice and those great =
lyrics were still there (and better than ever, in fact!) but the big, =
cacaphonous sound of the band's earlier stuff was gone, replaced with a =
sparse and spacey sound... it took a bit of adjustment, but honestly I =
think this is way better than their older stuff. The songs are way =
stronger, and the whole thing is just utterly dynamic... it's just a =
brilliant record back to front. It reminds me somewhat of Wire's =
transition from <i>Pink Flag</i> to <i>Chairs Missing</i>. If you can hang =
with that change, you can certainly hang with this... seriously, one of =
the year's best records so far.<br><br>

Bored Youth: <i>Are You Alive</i> 12" (Alona's Dream)<br>
More archival midwest hardcore from Alona's Dream Records. This time =
around it's a full LP worth of material from the highly underrated Bored =
Youth. My friend Scott described the a-side as "a real period piece," and =
I totally agree. Really, these guys would kind of fit with the middling =
bands on the <i>Flex Your Head</i> comp, but I just love the sound and =
vibe of those early Dischord and Touch and Go bands so much that I can't =
help but fall for this stuff. This also has a live set on the b-side, and =
while it's well-recorded and the band deliver a powerful performance, the =
mic sounds like it's next to the door guy so I find myself listening more =
to his conversations than the band. Still, if you're one of those people =
who want to hear every scrap of music from this era, this is well worth =
your while. Includes super nice packaging including screen printed jackets =
and clear vinyl.<br><br>

<i>Making a Scene: NYHC 85-88</i> book<br>
Reprint of this great book of photographs and anecdotes about the 80s NYHC =
hardcore scene. While there are a lot of little anecdotes and =
remembrances, the centerpiece of this book is the photographs, which are =
uniformly excellent. About half of the book is live photos of the bands =
you'd expect (Youth of Today, Warzone, Absolution, Nausea, etc., as well =
as some touring bands like Dag Nasty), but the real treat is the other =
half of the book, which is mostly people from the scene hanging out. I =

a document of an important scene, but also an era of New York that's =

Ugly Parts: <i>Wet</i> cassette (Bleeding Edges)<br>
New cassette from this New Jersey band and it pretty much perfectly fits =
in with the rest of the Bleeding Edges roster (Protester, Altered Boys, =
the Flex, etc.). Like those bands, there's definitely a lot of the =
X-Claim! Records influence, but there are some weird little parts to Ugly =
Parts as well, and those are my favorites. They're fleeting, but there's a =
kind of creepy vibe that reminds me of <i>My America</i>-era FU's, perhaps =
even approaching a bit of Rudimentary Peni in some parts. Regardless, this =
is a banger... if you like hardcore you need to hear this.<br><br>

Pro-printed demo tape from this new NYC band. Man, this is a banger... on =

Frau: demo cassette (Tuff Enuff)<br>
Demo tape from this new London band featuring at least one member of Good =

songs are very bass-led with the guitars kind of serving to accent parts =
of riffs. The drums also have that slightly off-kilter punk/post-punk =
sound, and the vibe taken as a whole is sort of like a modernized, more =
punk take on the DIY aesthetic of early Rough Trade bands like the Fall =
and Delta 5. Pretty much everything coming out of this London scene is =
straight fire, and this demo is no different. Highly recommended.<br><br>

Regimen: <i>Upprepning Ar Ofrankomlig</i> cassette (Not Normal)<br>
Tape release from this new Swedish HC band. The label's description =

similar take on catchy, early 80s USHC and the songs are high-energy and =
super fun. The vocals are quite high-pitched, which gives this a really =
youthful feel that I like to hear from this style of music. If you dig =
that Kick N Punch records, early 00s K-Town sound you'd be well-served to =
pick this up.<br><br>

American Hate: S/T cassette (Not Normal)<br>
Demo tape from this band out of Oklahoma featuring members of Glow God, =
whose LP I loved. Unlike Glow God, though, this is straight HC... however, =
it's hardcore that's dynamic, interesting, and well-played. This has a =
real early 80s feel, reminding me of classics by bands like Mecht Mensch =
as well as more contemporary stuff like Glue. There's also some =
interesting things happening in the songwriting and arrangements that =
makes me think of the early, more hardcore Shitty Limits stuff... I know =
those references are all over the place, but I think that speaks to how =
well-written and interesting this demo is. Can't wait to hear more from =
this band. Also, I should note that this comes with a zine-sized lyric =
booklet and an American Hate-branded shiv.<br><br>

Protester: 7" promo cassette (Bleeding Edges)<br>
Four-song promo cassette from DC's Protestor, which is the one-man band =

new straight up HC rippers on the a-side and two exclusive Agnostic Front =
covers on the b-side. This definitely displays a hearty influence from =

Gutter Gods: <i>Innersense</i> 12" (self-released)<br>
I think that I saw this described somewhere as "space oi!," which was a =
description that I found immensely intriguing. While Gutter Gods aren't =
quite as out there as that genre descriptor would imply, this is some =
interesting stuff. They've cleaned up quite a lot since the demo tape we =
had a few years back, adding a heavy dose of chorus on the guitar (which =
is quite uncommon for an oi! band, and I guess where the "space" thing =
comes from). Ultimately, though, I think this will appeal most to fans of =
the oi!/HC sound that's been quite popular over the past few years with =
bands like Violent Future, Violent Reaction, Night Stalker, etc. Really =
cool packaging on this one, too, including metallic silver foil =
covers.<br><br>

Long-awaited debut EP from these 4 New York ladies, and it's a beast. I =

that should give you a pretty good idea of where they're coming from =
musically, though the Die Kreuzen reference in their name is also a bit =
apt as there are some fancy little doodly-dahs on the guitar. Really, =
though, this is just straightforward, go-for-the-throat hardcore with =

Flesh World: S/T 12" (La Vida Es Un Mus)<br>
Debut 12" from this San Francisco band who (I believe) features members of =
Needles and Talk Is Poison. I've heard these guys kind of grouped in with =
the neo-post-punk sound, but this isn't chorus pedal and eyeliner music... =
rather, Flesh World sound to me like a punk version of a 90s Creation =
Records band. They have those big, noisy, yet melodic guitars and a great =
female vocalist, but their songs have the energy and power that you'd =
expect from people who came up through the hardcore scene. It's a little =
bit subtle and understated so may not knock you out on the first listen, =
but I've been going back to this LP again and again.<br><br>

Good Throb: <i>Fuck Off</i> 12" (Sabermetric)<br>
This is straight up one of the most exciting releases I've come across in =
some time. I liked Good Thob's previous 7"s... they were a bit rickety, =
super angry and super punk, but they take it to an entirely new level on =
this LP. There's a dash more melody in the guitars in particular now, and =
the bright and clear production really delivers the strength and power of =
these songs. As before, the lyrics are almost startlingly direct yet =
incredibly eloquent... these are lyrics that actually made me think about =
myself, my beliefs and my behavior, and when was the last time you could =
say that about a punk record? Simply put, everything about this from the =
songs to the performance to the recording to the packaging is just so =
utterly perfect and exactly what I want punk to be in 2014. Get this or =

Predator: <i>The Complete Earth</i> 12" (Scavenger of Death)<br>
Their first 12" was solid Atlanta garage that occasionally flirted with HC =
tempos, but this new LP from Predator is something else. They seem to be =
taking cues from their buds in GG King in pushing that classic, basic, =
catchy Atlanta punk sound into completed uncharted waters... like GG, they =
even flirt with a little black metal influence here and there, but it =
doesn't sound so heavy-handed here as it did on <i>Esoteric Lore</i>... =
basically, this is as catchy, memorable, and interesting a punk LP as I've =

More gnarly HC punk from the Toxic State camp... ramshackle drums, crazy =

Deformity: demo cassette (Toxic State)<br>
Deformity didn't storm out of the gate like a lot of the other NYC / Toxic =
State bands... their earlier releases were solid, but lacked a little =
something. However, the band has continued to grow and evolve, and after =
they had my favorite song on last year's <i>Ground Zero Hardcore</i> comp =
LP on Toxic State I was stoked to hear what they would do next. This new =
tape definitely fulfills the promise of that material, with raw, =
blistering hardcore punk that has a bit of the swagger of =
Stooges-influenced garage without any of the flaming hot rod bs that mars =
a lot of that genre. It's a similar sensibility to Hank Wood in that this =
kind of sounds garage but also clearly isn't garage... it just has all of =
the catchiness and drive of early punk. Highly recommended.<br><br>

Section Urbane: <i>The Final Program</i> 7" (540)<br>
The final release in 540 Records' series of reissues from 70s Brisbane =
punk labels Shake Music and Savage Music is this four-song EP from Section =
Urbane. Having released two previous singles of quirky punk as Just =
Urbain, the Brisbane band continued their unique =
Velvets-through-the-lens-of-Joy-Division approach through the name change, =
harnessing a fuller, more bass-heavy sound on their final recording =
session. The track, &ldquo;I'd Rather Stay Home And Watch TV,&rdquo; still =
has more than its fair share of the Aussie-garage stomp of bands like the =
Chosen Few and the Victims, but after that it&rsquo;s all about Mo Tucker =
beats, dark and poetic lyrics delivered with a distinctly Lou =
Reed-influenced drawl, and heavy, melodic Peter Hook-style bass lines. If =
you want to hear first-gen-DIY naivet&eacute;, post-punk artistic ambition =
and the party-hearty sensibility of the original Murder Punk bands clash =
together into something wholly unique, get this on your turntable right =
away.<br><br>

Back to Back: <i>Narcissist</i> 7" (540)<br>
2nd EP from this Houston band, and damn does it slay... I feel like when =
you play this kind of straight up, 80s-style hardcore you either have it =
or your don't, and Back to Back most certainly have it. It sounds quite a =
bit like the recent 7"s from Glue and DiE, two bands I've been obsessing =
over recently... time to add another one to the pile I guess!<br><br>

Skem&auml;ta: demo cassette (Sorry State)<br>
After the demise of Stripmines in the summer of 2012, Jeff Young (guitar) =
and Alex Taylor (bass) kept writing songs, looking for the perfect lineup =
to keep pushing forward their unique brand of raw, fast, and technical =
hardcore. Eventually recruiting Cameron Craig (Logic Problem, Double =
Negative, Davidians) on drums and Usman on vocals, Skem&auml;ta started =
playing shows in late 2013 and were immediately a force to be reckoned =
with. Fans of Stripmines will certainly love them, but Skem&auml;ta =
incorporates a bunch of new influences as well, like the subtle melodic =
qualities of Sickoids and the rawer, more direct hardcore of bands like =
Framtid and Bastard. Watch for a debut LP from these guys on Sorry State =
later this summer. This release is limited to 150 copies with 2-sided, =
screen printed j-cards, pro-duplicated tapes and download code.<br><br>

Narcoman: demo cassette (Sorry State)<br>
When Raleigh&rsquo;s Cross Laws broke up in 2007, Matt and Daniel went on =
to form Devour, but Dennis (bass and vocals) took an entirely different =
path, serving two years as part of the Peace Corps in Turkmenistan and =
then returning to North Carolina to be a high school teacher in Asheville. =
While he wasn&rsquo;t actively playing in any bands, Dennis had his guitar =
with him through this entire period, crafting and refining a huge backlog =
on songs. In the summer of 2013 Dennis got together with fellow Cross Laws =
alumnus Daniel as well as Cameron Craig (Logic Problem, Double Negative, =
Skem&auml;ta) on drums to make raw 4-track recordings of 4 of these songs. =
The results are quite a bit different from Cross Laws&hellip; more =
complex, refined, melodic, and subtle, Narcoman recalls the best of =
ambitious, catchy 80s hardcore like Articles of Faith, early Husker Du, =
and Upright Citizens. This release is limited to 150 copies with a =
screen-printed j-card, pro-duplicate tapes and download code.<br><br>
