Hello, List!
Here are the listings as of Dec 03, 2014.


Listings Project Story of the Week:

I'm a 25-year-old from Brazil moving to NYC next year, and even though I =
don't get there until March, as soon as I heard about your list I had a g=
ood feeling about it. I'd been super stressed about the fact that I'll ne=
ed to find a room there that I can actually afford, but now I feel confid=
ent that your listings project will be the solution to my problem :) I've=
 been looking every week and I've seen so much good stuff already - I'm s=
ure I'll find something perfect when the time comes- I'd be completely lo=
st without it. So... THANK YOU! - Bella


Best,
Stephanie

vailable In Beautiful Newly Renovated Bldg! Huge Range Of Sizes/Prices Av=
ailable!
Available: Dec 01, 2014

To anyone looking for a great new studio space to work in, I have been as=
ked to refer you to a new art studio project. I&#39;ve had my studio in t=
he same building for many years now, and it truly is a wonderful place to=
 work!=20

Because it&#39;s a brand new build out, there are many different spaces a=
vailable. The prices begin at $1025-$1350 for the medium-large ones. All =
have massive windows, and and are perfect size for sharing.

And then there are the truly enormous spaces with FAR more space and even=
 more windows. These range anywhere from $1400 - $4000.=20

Each space will have plenty of light and ventilation, as well as a heat a=
nd AC unit in every space. The building also provides gorgeous rooftop vi=
ews, 24 hour access and security, and an enormous loading dock and freigh=
t elevator.=20

For those not familiar with the area, it&#39;s generally thought of as a =
safe, quiet Brooklyn neighborhood. The building is just a few blocks from=
 the G train, with plenty of food options and easy street parking.

I have had my own art studio in this building for almost 4 years, and the=
 management has asked me to help get interest in the new spaces as they a=
re expanding the number of studios in the building. I will be the one sho=
wing the spaces and there are absolutely NO fees involved.

If you&#39;re interested, please text Jordan. I look forward to hearing f=
rom you. Thanks!

$600.00 Per Month, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, 200 sq. ft., Charming office/stu=
dio available in prime Greenpoint  (includes utilities)
Available: Jan 01, 2015

A semi-private space is available for sublease in my studio beginning Jan=
uary 1st, approximately 200 square feet for $600, utilities included (hea=
t &amp; electricity). The ceilings are 11 feet high, so it feels larger. =
The entire 600 sq foot studio is shared with two other people - my space =
is in the back and completely private with a door, while your space is in=
 the middle, divided from the other studio with a partial wall, which goe=
s all the way up to the ceiling. There are no windows, but abundant wall =
space and a small storage loft. Perfect for a painter.

The charming space has one exposed brick wall, and original details of wo=
od ceiling, beams and floor. It feels very comfortable and homey in there=
, great place to work. The photos feature my previous studiomates&#39; st=
uff, but it&#39;s best to take a look at it in person and see how you wou=
ld set it up yourself.

There is a freight elevator, mailbox, slop sink, clean bathrooms, and 24-=
hour access to building. Many artists and creative professionals in the b=
uilding.

Amazing, prime location, just 2 blocks from the G at Greenpoint Ave and w=
alking distance to tons of great bars, shops, and restaurants.

I prefer someone with a quiet practice - no woodworking (occasional is ok=
), loud machines, or toxic materials. It&#39;s also preferable if you wor=
k mostly nights and weekends since I work mostly weekdays, but not a requ=
isite. Also, I&#39;m only renting to an individual to keep the # of peopl=
e in the space to a minimum, no duos or groups. I require first month&#39=
;s rent plus 2 months security deposit. The lease is for one year, but if=
 you need to leave before then, you can give me 45 days notice.=20

$275.00 Per Month, Lorimer Stop, Williamsburg, 100 sq. ft., Tiny but Amaz=
ing Studio Share in Real Williamsburg!
Available: Dec 01, 2014

I am looking for someone to share my small, but amazingly located, studio=
 right at the Lorimer L stop--available immediately. I use it mainly for =
storage, so my studio-mate gets 100% access. Perfect for a writer, video/=
photo editor, or just someone who works small, the 10&#39;x10&#39; studio=
 is part of a complex of completely secure--and fully enclosed--studios w=
ith a clean, beautiful, and spacious common area and 24-hour building acc=
ess. Also includes:
- Free wifi
- Free central heat and AC
- Clean bathrooms
- Slop sink
- Freight elevator
- Comfortable, attractive seating in common area
- Vending machines and filtered water cooler in common area=20

Again, I am never there, so you use it around the clock. Caveats are that=
 there is no real natural light (just a little bit from a high window) an=
d there is not a lot of space. My stuff takes up about half of the studio=
, but there is room for a good-size desk (6 ft wide) and some shelving, p=
lus (previous studio-mates have been a painter of small works and a write=
r.)

My studio is light-filled, sturdy, private, and secure, with a wall of wi=
ndows that view  Queens and Manhattan skylines and ample blue sky. It is =
located in a building filled with art studios and small businesses at 117=
 Grattan Street in Bushwick.

I will not be using the space over the next 6 months or more and I am see=
king someone who would like to share the space with me. The timeframe of =
the share is flexible, so if you have specific parameters, please let me =
know and I may be able to work with that. You will have the place to your=
self 99% of the time as I will be using it primarily as a storage only. T=
here is also the possibility to stay on after 6 months, either sharing th=
e space when I am back using it, or you may be able to take over the leas=
e, if I decide not to stay.

Your portion of the space is approximately 350sf and I will retain 120-14=
0sf for the storage of my stuff, much of which can be stored behind a sli=
ding wall, out of sight.=20
Your portion of the rent is $700 plus utilities (which tend to be low.) I=
nternet is already included in the rent. The studio comes with a mailbox =
in the building, so you can receive mail and packages and the building ma=
nagement has a helpful super who is reachable during the day. There is a =
freight elevator and gated driveway for easy unloading. The studio has it=
s own heater and thermostat.

117 Grattan is within walking distance of galleries, restaurants, and all=
 kinds of shops. I am looking for someone who is responsible, courteous a=
nd who will be
respectful of the space and my belongings. Shares will be considered.
No band practice inquiries please.

As a performance artist and puppeteer I have always had trouble renting s=
pace because I have a lot of stuff, and it often needs to be worked on du=
ring a rehearsal period.  The imnotlost space is inaugurated in an attemp=

ios also has workshop and storage space.  Rehearsals and building do not =
go on simultaneously.  Rehearsals are scheduled nights and weekends.  The=
 workshop is available during weekdays.  The shortest membership is one w=
eek.  One to three month memberships are preferred.

sink, two walls of windows, and free wifi.  Soon there will be storage sh=
elves, work tables, a boom box, and a rehearsal curtain.

The rehearsal space is currently available for rental on nights and weeke=
nds in 4 hour sessions with a minimum of 5 sessions booked at a sliding s=
cale of $10-$16/ hour.

Storage space is only available for objects in the show you are working o=
n at the time of your membership.  Shelf storage is free.  Larger items c=

$1,500.00 Per Month, Sunset Park, Brooklyn, 600 sq. ft., Renovated One be=
droom sublet with best rooftop in Brooklyn
Available: Dec 16, 2014 through Dec 31, 2015

I&#39;m offering a one bedroom sublet in a two bedroom apartment. Me, the=
 room mate, will only be here occasionally because my family and I are re=
locating to Bangkok. So you basically got the place for yourself apart fr=
om a couple of times a year. The room itself fits a queen size bed, has a=
n almost walk-in closet and a nice window looking out to the backyard. Th=
e apartment is fully renovated, with a modern kitchen and a nice living s=
pace. Limited furniture (such as a television and some kitchen stuff) is =
available. The big selling point of the apartment is a private roof top w=
ith the best view in Brooklyn. And yes, we have great neighbors too.

The neighborhood is the biggest draw: up and coming but still true New Yo=
rk with lots of Hispanic and Chinese restaurants and shops. Sunset Park (=
the actual park) is only two blocks away. It has an outdoor swimming pool=
! The R-train at 45th, a block and a half away, takes you to the N and D =
express at 36th and then you are at Union Square within less than half an=
 hour.

The pictures don&#39;t do the place justice: all the stuff you see in the=
 pictures will be organized before move in. We are flexible still in term=
s of the duration: it could be for 6 months, a year or longer.

I&#39;m looking for obviously a reliable person who I can trust the place=
 to while I&#39;m away. Limited pets are ok, smoking only on the roof top=
.

$933.00 Per Month, Astoria, New York, 200 sq. ft., Huuuuge unfurnished ro=
om in an equally large 3-bedroom Astoria apartment
Available: Dec 14, 2014

Howdy, apartment searcher! Looking for a boatload of space? Like, put-a-f=
ull-size-couch-in-your-room kinda space with a lot of room left for activ=
ities AND 10+ foot-wide closets? Yes, you have are. And you just found it=
. This baby is ready for move-in in mid-December. I&#39;m moving with a f=
riend to Brooklyn, and will miss Astoria like whoa.

The Room: Essentially a studio apartment-size space within a second-floor=
, three-bedroom apartment. Two windows that bring in massive light, two c=
losets that are almost unbelievably wide. There is a permanent air condit=
ioning sleeve set into the wall beneath one window for a very large air c=
onditioner, should you wish to find one - I did not. (You&#39;ll see I al=
so have a full-size keyboard, full-size couch and a full bed in there, an=
d there&#39;s extra space aplenty.) The room is on the opposite side of t=
he apartment from the other two, which means complete privacy. You&#39;ll=
 share a full bathroom, which is directly across the hall from your door.=


The Apartment: A true 3-bedroom with a common space as fantastically huge=
 as the bedroom you&#39;re currently daydreaming about. Modern radiator h=
eat controlled by a thermostat. Full-size eat-in open kitchen, brand new =
sectional sofa, and a huge, old-school TV with cable, wifi, and...have I =
mentioned all the space? Your roommates, friends of mine for quite some t=
ime, will both be women (Katy and Stephanie, both working in television p=
roduction, both very fun and chill), but neither male nor female is prefe=
rred (I&#39;m a guy). You will also have the pleasure of a lazy black cat=
 roommate named Morgan.=20

The Area: Off the Astoria Blvd. stop at Steinway street - 30 seconds away=
 from the M60 bus (which, if you catch it, will speed you right to the su=
bway in one stop), an 8-minute walk to the N/Q train. 20 minutes to La Gu=
ardia airport via the M60, and you&#39;re right at the Q101, which runs a=
ll the way through Astoria proper. The walk to 30th ave is ultra fast, an=
d Ditmars is even closer. And - AND! - best of all, the famous Bohemian B=
eer Hall and Garden is less than ten minutes from your new front door.

You: mid-to-late 20s to early 30s, pay all bills and rent in full and on =
time. Willing to watch American Horror story and Law &amp; Order reruns w=
ith roommates every now and then. If you&#39;re interested, please send m=
e a little about yourself so I can share with Katy and Stephanie. Faceboo=
k/Instagram/Twitter/LinkedIn, etc. would be super helpful too. Tinder pro=
files unnecessary.=20

To move in, security deposit ($933) and prorated December rent ($465). De=
cember utilities are on me. If you have other questions for me at all, pl=
ease let me know.

$1,250.00 Per Month, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 144 sq. ft., Lovely Brick Wi=
lliamsburg Apartment
Available: Jan 01, 2015 through Apr 30, 2015

About this listing:
My place is a lovely 2 bedroom ,1 bathroom apartment in Brooklyn.  I am r=
enting out the second bedroom.  The rent includes utilities.

The space:=20
I have a great 2 bedroom apartment in the popular Williamsburg neighborho=
od. The apartment is on the third floor of a 3 unit brick building very c=
ommon and historic in Brooklyn. I am the top unit , I can see tree tops o=
ut of all the windows. The entire apartment is hardwood floors with lots =
of natural light and and an overall great place to spend time. The floor =
plan is very open. The kitchen, eating nook, and living room are one conn=
ected space, and the 2 bedrooms are on opposite ends of the apartment, wh=
ich offers nice privacy for roommates. The bedroom faces a park in the ba=
ck and is cozy with a large window with trees filtering a lot of the ligh=
t. This bedroom could come with a full size bed if you would like, but it=
 easy to remove if you want a blank slate. The room faces opposite of the=
 street so it feels nice and tucked away. It is fully equipped with WiFi.=
 I have one full bathroom, with a tub and a shower, clean and white! All =
the things you might need in a full kitchen right next to a great little =
eating nook. The living room is equipped with a daybed with two large win=
dows. This room is very comfortable and easy to relax in. There is a shel=
f but no closet in the bedroom, but the closet in the living room is enti=
rely yours.

about me:=20
I am a 36 year old female restaurant manager. I work a lot of hours mostl=
y at night. I am very tidy but love to relax at home, and am frequently o=
ut and about. I am not a late crazy partier, but I will have a friend or =
two over for dinner and drinks on occasion. I would love someone I could =
talk to and even occasionally share a drink, but is independent and into =
their own things.  I frequently am home in the morning, but do not get ho=
me from work until midnightish.  Over all I am down to earth, easy going,=
 try to be funny...and enjoy others.  Mostly I am reading at home or maki=
ng a snack.

location:=20
I love being in Williamsburg close to such lively and interesting shops a=
nd restaurants on Bedford, Wythe, Berry and Havermeyer streets. From here=
 great coffee shops, restaurants,and boutiques, are steps away. Despite t=
he close proximity to all of these things, my street is just quiet enough=
 for a reprieve if you need a little oasis away from the action,. It is o=
n the south side (S. 4th in between Berry and Bedford) of Williamsburg bu=
t north of Broadway. It is just a mere 8 minute walk to the &quot;L&quot;=
 and&quot;JMZ&quot; trains, both only one stop away from Manhattan. My la=
ndlord lives in the building for a very convivial and safe feel.

Hello, I am currently living in a spacious 2 bedroom railroad apartment i=
n Bed-Stuy. My roommate is moving out at the end of the year and I would =
like to have someone move in for few months till my girlfriend comes back=
 from Europe.
This is a fully furnished railroad apartment on the top floor only 3 bloc=
ks away from the J train (Halsey station) and a couple more to the C trai=
n (Ralph). Laundry mat is 1 block down, 2 supermarkets 2 blocks down, bun=
ch of restaurants, 24/7 Ride Aid, and bodegas in every corner. Also they =
are opening a French coffee shop just few steps away from our door!

Now about the apartment! You can have the room that is currently the livi=
ng room which means more privacy too! The apartment is in great shape and=
 has two entrance doors, 3 rooms, a Huge kitchen, plenty of closet space =
and very nice bathroom overall it is a very spacious and clean apartment!=
 The sofa bed is queen sized and price includes everything (Wi-Fi, gas, h=
eat and electricity). Place is always warm in the winter.
Now few things about me and what I am looking for. I am an artist, I work=
 and I am in an out all the time. The one extra room we have I use for dr=
awing. I am looking for somebody preferably a guy that works, is an artis=
t (but not necessarily), is clean and like things be in order (I may cons=
ider couples too). My party days are way over so I am expecting someone i=
n a similar page or one who takes the party elsewhere if you know what I =
mean. In general the time I am home I either spend it in peace by either =
drawing, chilling or cooking.
You can stay for 3-4 months or for less but the ideal roommate should sta=
y for the whole period.

1st month + security deposit + proof of employment is a must!

Friendly to behaved pets! ;)
Looking forward to your emails

$1,695.00 Per Month, Soho, New York, Room to rent in beautiful apartment =
(....with its own roof deck!)
Available: Dec 01, 2014 through Aug 31, 2015

Hi! My name is Kristi Kelly. I&#39;m an NYU grad currently working in tec=
h in SoHo. I&#39;m looking for a super chill roommate for the second bedr=
oom in a great apartment.

My favorite things are music and science. I studied psych and neuroscienc=
e in school.

About my living habits... I&#39;m super friendly and get along with every=
one. My one serious pet peeve is that I don&#39;t like to share my stuff-=
-food, clothes, etc. Blame growing up in a big-ish Irish family! Honestly=
, besides that it&#39;s all good. I expect a roommate to respect this, as=
 I will definitely be respectful of them.

I mostly keep to myself and am super busy with work, but I like to go out=
 occasionally and have a lot of friends in the area. I am also very kind =
and helpful when it is needed. I&#39;m proud to be supportive of my frien=
ds and the people close to me--which would obviously include a roommate!

Guys or girls welcome. Social butterflies or kind-hearted hermits, yes. P=
lease no crazy party animals. Also smoke free, drug free! Alcohol doesn&#=
39;t count, unless you plan to brew moonshine. In which case the question=

There are two other roommates, late 20&#39;s males, both professionals wh=

I am definitely looking for a respectful mature person to take the room.
This room would best suit someone who is busy, and prefers a spacious cle=

Available: Jan 01, 2015 through Feb 28, 2015

We are two roommates seeking a third to move into our lovely apartment fo=

The room is $1000/month (including all utilities and internet) and is unf=
urnished. (May be the possibility of buying some of the furniture, tbd.) =
The room is small, but fits a full-sized bed and has a closet (with extra=
 storage space above it) and a nice, big window facing away from the stre=
et and lots of sunlight. The apartment has beautiful, blue 13-foot ceilin=
gs, and an incredibly well-outfitted kitchen. There are hardwood floors t=
hroughout and exposed brick walls.

When were not crazy busy, we like to hang out, cook dinner, and chip away=
 at our Netflix queue. There&#39;s laundry nearby, a grocery store a bloc=
k away, a 24-hour Rite-Aid across the street and it wouldn&#39;t take you=
 more than 10 minutes to walk to Prospect Park. We&#39;re one block away =
from the F/G/R stops at 4th Avenue/9th Street.

Proof that you can handle paying rent required + security deposit. Lookin=
g for someone available January 1. No couples or pets. Two-month commitme=
nt preferred.=20

$1,600.00 Per Month, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 1 Private BR Sublet Availabl=
e in a 2 BR Spacious New Apt in the Heart of Williamsburg, same block as =
Bedford L train
Available: Jan 18, 2015 through Mar 22, 2015

This is for one private room of a 2 BR, 1 bath, spacious, and new apartme=
nt located in the heart of the vibrant artistic community of Williamsburg=
, Brooklyn. We&#39;re located on the same block as the Bedford L stop so =
it&#39;s extremely convenient for getting around -- you can get to Union =
Square in 5 minutes and we&#39;re only 1 stop away from Manhattan. I&#39;=
ll be in South America and Antarctica for 2 months from January 18 - Marc=
h 22, so those are the dates that the room is available. I&#39;m asking f=
or $3,200 for the duration of 1/18 - 3/22, which comes out to $1,600 a mo=
nth for 2 months. You would be potentially sharing the apartment with ano=
ther guest. I&#39;m also asking for a security deposit of $800.

The room contains a double bed. The place is bright and clean and in a gr=
eat area -- close enough to Bedford, Metropolitan, or Grand to enjoy all =
of the amazing bars, cafes, and restaurants, but just a touch off of the =
main drag to provide a semblance of peace. Also, if you like movies and/o=
r independent cinema, there are some great movie theaters within walking =
distance of our apartment. We are also 5 blocks from the waterfront, wher=
e you can experience some of the best views of the Manhattan skyline and =
also the Brooklyn Flea market and Smorgasburg food festival on the weeken=
ds.

Fresh linens and towels are provided, there is high speed internet and ca=
ble, central AC. Free coffee and tea are available upon request. In addit=
ion, I would be more than happy to provide information about the area or =
Manhattan or help out in whatever way we can.

There&#39;s ample desk and table space in case you want to hook up a lapt=
op and work for a while. Last but not least, our apartment building has a=
 rooftop!

If you need any recommendations, you can ask me and I&#39;ll do my best t=
o help you enjoy the city!

$1,000.00 Per Month, ridgewood/bushwick, new york, 2 Rooms in Very Large =
Renovated Industrial Space in Ridgewood/Bushwick
Available: Dec 01, 2014 through Apr 30, 2015

We lease a very large space that used to be a factory (living/dining room=
 are 55x26x11) and have 2 rooms available December 1st and January 1st (o=
r possibly sooner): 10x9x11 lofted room with big window and bed included =
if needed (Dec,) and a 12x11x11 lofted room with 2 very large windows (Ja=
n.) The whole house gets tons of sunlight with 4 windows and a skylight i=
n the common areas as well.  We are in Ridgewood just across the border f=
rom Bushwick.

The 10x9x11 room is avail Dec 1st for 3 months.

The 12x11x11 room is avail Jan 1st for 4 months.

Ideally, we&#39;re looking for someone who can appreciate the massive spa=
ce and put it to use. It&#39;s an event space, so you could have an art o=
pening, teach a class, have a performance art type show, movie screening,=
 photography/film shoot, etc. We are currently under construction downsta=
irs building a recording studio.

The space is large and gets dirty quickly.  You need to be pro-active abo=
ut cleaning so that we can all enjoy the space that we share.  If we all =
do a little bit more than we think is expected well all be happy.

One thing to note: The massive space does not get especially warm in the =
harsh winter months. We have only 2 radiators in the communal area which =
does not retain heat very well at all. Expect to wear layers and sweaters=
. The bedrooms each have a radiator and we&#39;ll provide a supplemental =
electric heater if needed.

About us:

Roommates #1 &amp; #2 (couple) live downstairs and are constructing the s=
tudio. We both work in film (in the field mixing and booming, in the stud=
io post-production) and we play in our duo band (whatpreytell.bandcamp.co=
m) We&#39;re young at 26 &amp; 29, ambitious, drink sometimes, smoke some=
times, and like to throw a show out of the event space in the winter time=
. We practice about twice to 5 times a month and only during the day time=
 hours so it doesn&#39;t disturb anyone&#39;s slumber. We are fun, easy-g=
oing and very busy!

Roommate #3 is a sound guy. He works a lot, but you&#39;ll see him in the=
 afternoons. He&#39;s a cheeky sort of chap, a little older (something li=
ke 35) but young at heart. Very very fun to be around when he&#39;s had a=
 few. Loves to play chess. A good guy.

Roommates #4 &amp; #5 are a friendly couple. She&#39;s a bartender/waitre=
ss who likes to hoola hoop and he manages the seafood station at whole fo=
ods. I don&#39;t see them but once a week on average and usually late at =
night after they get off work.

Roommate #6 works a lot but is very knowledgeable in technology and compu=
ters. He&#39;s also a dj by night. Fun great awesome guy.

Roommate#7 works 2 jobs and goes to school so we hardly ever see her.  Sh=
e goes to school for fashion.

We all love to play vinyls. Sometimes we put a movie on the projector at =
night. We all do our part to keep the communal spaces neat and clean. Bug=
s and rodents are a non-issue. We have 1.5 bathrooms. We smoke our cigs o=
utside. The vibe here is free &amp; chill, and we hope to maintain that. =
 It isn&#39;t a party house by any stretch- it is a home, but we have our=
 friends over sometimes and it can get a little loud.  We all try our bes=
t to be respectful and communicative about our needs.  All I really mean =
is, if the record is playing too loudly or voices are up, just say so!  W=
e appreciate communication.=20

No furry pets- allergies!

We&#39;re a 3 block walk from the L train stop Dekalb stop-- Post office,=
 shops, supermarket, dollar stores, beer distributors, &amp; laundromats =
are all within short walking distance! The M train is a short 9 blocks aw=
ay as well as the B38 bus around the corner takes you to downtown Brookly=
n in 20 mins!  If you have a bicycle, we have plenty of space for you to =
park it inside.

First month, last month rent, and deposit are required to move in. That&#=
39;s $3,000.  A great deal for someone who has an appreciation and use fo=
r so much communal event space.  Again, the rooms can be furnished with b=
eds as well as shelving and anything else you might need.  Just ask!  The=
 rent does not include utilities, which runs about $70-$90 per person.

Please make your subject line &quot;[Your name] in Space!.&quot;

$2,690.00 Per Month, East Harlem, New York, Unique East Harlem 2 BR/1.5BA=
 Duplex (convertible to 3 BR) (with private patio, roof deck)
Available: Dec 01, 2014

Rent: $2690/month. No fee.=20

Bedrooms: 2 (convertible to 3)

Bathrooms: 1.5

Location: 164 East 112th Street (btw. 3rd &amp; Lexington). The apartment=
 is on the ground floor, in the back -- makes for a very easy move in.=20=


Commuting: It&#39;s 2 blocks from the 6 train 110th street stop -- very c=
onvenient to get out and get on the subway in the morning. We are also a =
few avenues over from the 2/3 110th street stop (about a 10 minute walk).=


Why it&#39;s great:=20
On the main level: both bedrooms, the kitchen and dining area, a closet f=
or coats, and the main bathroom (which has a lovely stand-up glass-enclos=
ed shower). Off one bedroom is a private patio area which is really lovel=
y. Both bedrooms have big spacious closets and easily fit a queen bed (or=
 larger).

There&#39;s also a huge lower level that can be converted to a 3rd bedroo=
m OR used as a living room, guest room, rec room, office, etc. -- and als=
o has a decent-sized half-bathroom.

From that level there&#39;s access to the basement of the building with e=
asy bike storage, laundry room, trash &amp; recycling, as well as additio=
nal storage for the unit.

The apt also has central a/c and heating and brand new appliances (includ=
ing a dishwasher), access to a gym in the building next door, and a very =
big rooftop decked out with nice furniture.

We are breaking our lease because one of us had to move out of New York u=
nexpectedly, but we really wish we could have stayed -- it is a fabulous =
place and we can&#39;t say enough nice things about it, the building, or =
the landlord.=20

This place is ideal for a family or for roommates. For the amount of spac=
e you get, this is a real bargain. I am not a broker. I am one of the cur=
rent tenants but I am not currently living there (I have moved into anoth=
er apartment). As I mentioned in the posting, one of our roommates unexpe=
ctedly had to move out of NYC and my other roommate and I could not affor=
d to stay in the apartment, so we are breaking the lease.=20

As we are breaking our lease, we need someone in right away, so if you ar=
e interested don&#39;t hesitate -- get in touch right away!

 Production Designer for film. Though I have been working with a broker, =
he is a friend, and if the apartment were taken by someone from the listi=
ngs project, there would be no fees paid. I would probably show the space=
. From the tenant, it would be good to show proof of employment, to show =
that they could cover the rent, and some rental history, or possibly a gu=
arentor could provide help if it was unavailable.

Available: Jan 01, 2015 through Jul 31, 2015

I&#39;m looking for someone to take over my lease of a lovely East Villag=
e studio with a balcony starting January 1st. Lease ends July 31st with t=
he option to renew as long as youre in good standing.=20
Conveniently located on 11th St near 1st Ave, a 10 minute walk from Union=
 Square and a 7 minute walk to the Astor 6. There&#39;s a great little co=
ffee shop right downstairs and I love to get pastries at Veniero&#39;s, o=
nly two doors down.
This walk-up has a balcony with a beautiful sky view.=20
Updated bath and kitchen, with a dishwasher. Pets are allowed and guarant=
ors are accepted. You would completely take over my lease through the man=
agement company. I will be happy to help you with the easy process.=20

ine and the tenant before me). I&#39;ve spoken to the management company,=
 and they allow lease assignments. I will pay a lease termination fee and=

). The new lessee will pay no broker fee (I&#39;m renting the apartment, =
I&#39;m not a broker). The next tenant will have to submit a normal appli=
cation to Westminster (which I believe costs $100, maybe less, but no mor=
e). The application includes a copy of a photo ID, two last bank statemen=
ts, most recent tax returns, and last two pay stubs (the &quot;normal stu=
ff&quot; for a renter&#39;s application). There is a refundable deposit i=
f someone would like to have a dog here, but a cat requires no deposit. I=
 will be showing the apartment myself. I will coordinate with anyone inte=
rested to find a time that works for both of our schedules.=20

$2,950.00 Per Month, Bushwick (Bed/Stuy, Wburg Border), Brooklyn, Gorgeou=
s, Enormous, Two and a 1/2 bedroom townhouse with garden
Available: Feb 01, 2015 through May 01, 2016

We are subletting our beautiful two-story, apartment (that feels more lik=
e a house) for at least a year beginning February 1st. It is insanely spa=
cious for New York, and also very sunny, quiet and convenient to the city=
.=20

It was built in 1899 and we have the parlor floor and upstairs, which fea=
tures several small skylights. It has a huge beautiful kitchen with good =
appliances (gas stove, dishwasher, microwave) that overlooks the wonderfu=
l backyard which we share with our downstairs neighbors. The kitchen and =
living room are wonderful for entertaining  very open, high ceilings and =
lots of natural light.=20

It has two real bedrooms and one bath, and a small third room that we use=
 as our baby&#39;s room.  There are floor to ceiling built in bookshelves=
 everywhere and a great washer/dryer. It has been recently renovated with=
 taste, so although it has unbelievable old world charm, everything feels=
 clean and new.=20

This place is very special to us, (and really an amazing find in general)=
 so we very much want to find the right people. It is ideal for a couple,=
 a family with a child, or possibly for two people who are renting togeth=
er, but we&#39;re not looking for more than two adult roommates in the ap=
artment.=20

It is located at the nexus of Williamsburg/Bushwick/Bed Stuy. It is a fiv=
e minute walk from the JMZ Flushing stop which gets you to the Lower East=
 Side in 7 minutes, and the W4th St stop in ten. If you have a car the st=
reet parking is relatively easy.=20

Unfortunately, although we love them, we cannot have pets. It&#39;s fully=
 furnished with nice furniture, but can clear some of the decorative thin=
gs out, so that you can make it feel like your own.=20

We&#39;ll need a security deposit of one month&#39;s rent.  $2,950 a mont=
h, and that includes all utilities (except internet) which are a major ex=
pense in a house this size.We&#39;d love to answer your questions, and ha=
ve you come see the place, so please get in touch.

re already installed in the bedroom. Additionally, the entryway has been =
fitted with storage cabinets and shoe cubbies. Being at the rear of the b=
uilding, the apartment is unbelievably private and quiet and the kitchen =
window overlooks a secluded yard which gets lots of morning sun. =20

Heating and water are included; subletter will be expected to pay for oth=
er utilities
The apartment would be perfect for a couple or someone living on their ow=
n. I don&#39;t have photos as of now. We recently moved and am still movi=
ng some boxes out

Thank so much.

$630.00 Per Week, Crown Heights, Brooklyn, 650 sq. ft., Gorgeous brownsto=
ne live/work space
Available: Dec 15, 2014 through Feb 01, 2015

This gorgeous 19th century brownstone parlor floor apartment is a true
oasis in the heart New York City. It usually serves as live-work space
for myself, a dancer/bodywork &amp; yoga instructor, but is incredibly
versatile and can suit various creative and living needs.

Situated on a quiet, tree-lined block of brownstones on the edge of
Prospect Heights and historic Crown Heights, the apartment is
spacious, quiet and serene, and within short walking distance to all
the best that Brooklyn has to offer - the many excellent restaurants, caf=
es and bars
that line Franklin Avenue, the Brooklyn Museum and Botanic
Garden, scenic Prospect Park, the Central Library and Grand
Army Plaza.

Original details from the late 19th century grace the high ceilings
and antique closet doors, and natural light seeps in to every room
from the quiet courtyard that surrounds the apartment on all sides. There=
 is access to the huge backyard via a balcony off the bedroom in the back=
.

The apartment has three large rooms, each with
at least one window looking out on a quiet garden. The back room
serves as the bedroom, with a queen size memory foam bed and large
built in closet. It also features an 8&#39; long workbench, which, with
the abundant light from three windows and the Southern exposure of the
room, creates the perfect setting for drawing, drafting, crafting and
other creative projects.

The middle room features an antique cabinet grand piano, a dining area
and a king size sleeper couch. The entire apartment has excellent acousti=
cs
and has been enjoyed by many a musician.

Finally, the front room is an immaculate and inspiring 350 sq. ft.
open studio space, with newly refinished hardwood floors, vibrant
tapestries and cushions - it is the perfect setting to rest and
restore from busy days in the city, to rehearse and to invigorate your
meditation, yoga, or other wellness practice.

There is a full bathroom and a small kitchen with an electric stove
top, toaster oven, electric kettle and all the amenities
needed for simple cooking and elegant dining.=20

There&#39;s a high speed internet connection and wireless modem for your =
convenience.
Utilities and internet are included. A deposit and referrals will also be=
 required.

The price listed is a weekly rate and can be lower for longer stays (over=
 two weeks). There&#39;s also a possibility of extending the sublet perio=
d past 2/1/15 under certain circumstances.=20

Single and double occupancy is welcome, larger groups will be
considered on an individual basis and may incur an additional charge.
Pets and smoking are not allowed. An email with a little bit about
yourself and the purpose of your visit is appreciated and will assure
a prompt response.

r Doorman Bldg
Available: Dec 10, 2014 through Jan 31, 2015

Where better to spend the holidays than in the picturesque Riverside Hist=
orical District of the Upper West Side?=20

-- Monthly rent available. Price somewhat negotiable.=20
--The Space--

This apartment, in a luxury doorman building, situated between West End A=
ve and Riverside Dr., is a terrific place to snuggle up on chilly, winter=
 days. Every day, you&#39;ll be greeted by friendly staff and a gorgeous =
foyer-- and that&#39;s just the entrance.

--Who I Am--
-- a graduate student at Columbia, poet, aspiring polyglot, German and Ic=
elandic translator, fashion-saavy, previous Wall St. editor, planning to =
visit family during winter break.

If you are interested in renting the apartment, please contact me. We can=
 arrange a viewing-- in person, or via Skype/Face Time. More (daytime) ph=
otos available as well.

I would like to make arrangements to sublease the apartment asap, so that=
 I can have peace of mind knowing that my home is in the right hands. I a=
m willing to negotiate prices.=20

--Guest Access--
The apartment itself comes with perks, in addition to being lovely (see p=
ictures):

e.g.,
-- the heating and air conditioning are in a central unit;=20
-- the windows in the living room are around 60&quot; across, and equally=
 as tall, boasting a view of the city that is particularly lovely after t=
he sun goes down;=20
--Seasonal Affective Disorder light therapy floor lamp=20
-- the ceilings are high, giving the room an additional feeling of airine=
ss;=20
-- the high ceilings provide for ledges (on which you can store items or =
add nice room accents)=20
-- the building is very quiet and the tenants are pleasant=20
-- elevators (of course)=20
-- a roof/sun deck complete with grills, lounge chairs, and tables=20
-- close proximity to Broadway, Amsterdam, etc. and loads of restaurants =
and boutiques.... but not too close! The noise pollution from Broadway? N=
on-existent.=20
-- half a block from Riverside Park, and just a few blocks from the Grant=
 monument
-- 2.5 blocks from the nearest subway entrance=20
-- laundry, dollies, etc. in basement=20
-- garbage shoot/recycling area on each floor


--Interaction with Guests--
In terms of what I am offering:

-- the apartment is fully furnished;=20
-- I am an extremely tidy person and like to keep the place clean (regula=
rly deep cleaned by a cleaning service);=20
-- I will provide the linens (bedding, kitchen cloths), but request that =
you bring your own towels, if possible.=20
-- Use of any and all of my kitchen appliances (juicer, toaster, waffle i=
ron, coffee pot, food processor, rice cooker, utensils, etc.) and spices

-- Cool Stuff --
I grew up in the boonies and I swear I have never lived anywhere quieter =
than this street.=20

The jazz bar up the block, on Broadway, is open until 4 am, serving food =
and beverages, AND jazz. Live. For free. Every night.=20

The Earth Cafe is the newest addition to the neighborhood, alongside Fili=
cori. The former is French-style, the latter Italian-style. Should you be=
 in search of German-style, a quick 15-block walk north will take you the=
re. Also of note: Symphony Space  at 95th, Bar Thalia (more free jazz), C=
andle Cafe West (vegan!), art supply stores galore, a hotbed of street fe=
stival activity, 4 blocks from Central Park.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

 a nice dining table which pulls out to seat 6-8 people. The small bathro=
om with tub is located off the kitchen. The adjacent room has a closet an=

$900.00 Per Month, Greenpoint/Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Midwestern creative=

Available: Jan 01, 2015 through Jan 01, 2016

Thanks for looking! I&#39;m a creative professional in my 20s looking for=
 a long-term room to rent. I&#39;m very clean, respectful and keep to mys=
elf for the most part. Originally from Iowa, so I&#39;m incredibly polite=
 and can be social, however I never bring the party home but may have a f=
riend over once in a while. I also used to work as a chef for a French re=
staurant so I keep the kitchen impeccably clean.

I&#39;m also open to offering some of my skills in addition to rent which=
 might be an ideal situation for someone who needs help with computers, i=
Pads, iPhones, etc once in a while or someone looking to fix/renovate the=
ir place. I was my grandma&#39;s IT department when I was in Iowa, so I&#=
39;m familiar with explaining things in a way that makes sense. I&#39;m a=
lso handy in home renovations, fixing things, etc as I was raised by a ge=
neral contractor for buildings. Generally speaking I like to help others =
and I like to create with my hands.

I&#39;m looking for a mid-Januray move-in if possible, but can be a bit f=
lexible with date and rent amount. If this sounds like a good fit, please=
 send any photos my way of the place and let&#39;s start a conversation!

eby. I&#39;m seeking out a large studio or 1-bedroom, no more than $1600/=
month. Would be a total plus if laundry was onsite! Also would consider m=
oving into a share if it was the right fit. I&#39;m a 30-something freela=
nce artist and professor, clean, quiet, don&#39;t have a ton of furniture=
, am a non-smoker with no pets, great roommate of many over the years, an=
d stellar tenant. Open to a sublet or signing a new lease. I&#39;ll be tr=
aveling a lot in dec and jan, so ideally would love to find a place for J=
an 1 or 15 when I&#39;m back in the country, but am flexible. I hope I ca=
n connect with someone to rent a space off this list..it&#39;s such a gre=
at resource and community!!!

Thanks!
Mia

$1,800.00 Per Month, EV, LES, W. Village, Nolita, Soho, UWS, B'klyn Heigh=

derful care of your space!
Available: Dec 13, 2014

Seeking a studio, one bedroom or an apartment share beginning as soon as =
possible and lasting for at least six months (potentially longer if all w=
orks out.)  I am a female marketing and product development professional =
who is very neat, clean, kind, and considerate. I consider my home my oas=
is so generally meet friends out rather than entertaining at home. I enjo=
y painting, reading, traveling, long meandering walks through the city, l=
ive music, and good food and wine.

I&#39;d consider a furnished or unfurnished space but would prefer to at =
least bring my bedroom furniture if at all possible (but this is not a de=
al breaker.)

I am a non-smoker and would like to live in a smoke-free environment. Als=
o, I am allergic to cats.

Thanks for reading, and I look forward to speaking to you and seeing your=
 place.
