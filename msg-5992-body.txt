Hello, List!
Here are the listings as of Feb 26, 2014.


Listings Project Story of the Week:
The inquiries for my share came in fast and furious and there were tons of them. Of the first two people that contacted me, they both seemed perfect and I have met with one of them already and he definitely wants to move in and I am meeting with a second person on Friday when I get back from upstate. Between those two, I am sure the room will be rented but if for some reason they both cancel out, there were several other really interesting people, people I would love to become friends with. Using this list was so easy and rewarding and took all the stress out of looking for a new roommate. So thanks! You guys are doing a great thing! Byron


Best,
Stephanie

$470.00 Per Month, Bed-Stuy / South Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 230+ sq. ft., Share in a huge, beautiful studio with jeweller / illustrator - flexible amount of space available
Available: Mar 10, 2014

Hello!
I'm moving into a 700sq ft studio, and I'm looking to find two people to share it with. I'm going to be taking a third of it, so there's about 460 sq ft left over - for the prices in this ad I've broken that cleanly in half, but if you wanted to divide it differently, it's flexible.

The 700sq ft space is one-third of a way larger studio. Walls have been built dividing the large space, and it's only semi private. The other two studios are occupied by amazing people, so the lack of privacy shouldn't be a problem - they are a woodworker and a painter /...

Hello! 

I am looking for someone to split my room with. This situation would be ideal for someone who is looking to save money and isn't home often, but needs a clean, drama -free place to crash. I work, go to school, and have a studio all in the city, so I'm rarely home.

It's only a 10 minute walk to Prospect Park! Franklin Avenue is nearby, which has a ton of new coffee shops...

uary 26, 2014.</p><div><b>Listings Project Story of the Week:</b><br>The in=
quiries for my share came in fast and furious and there were tons of them. =
Of the first two people that contacted me, they both seemed perfect and I h=
ave met with one of them already and he definitely wants to move in and I a=
m meeting with a second person on Friday when I get back from upstate. Betw=
een those two, I am sure the room will be rented but if for some reason the=
y both cancel out, there were several other really interesting people, peop=
le I would love to become friends with. Using this list was so easy and rew=
arding and took all the stress out of looking for a new roommate. So thanks=
! You guys are doing a great thing! -Byron</p></div><p><b>Post a listing, s=
