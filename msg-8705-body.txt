$650.00 Per Month, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 450 sq. ft., $650/month 1-2 sp=
ots available - Photo Studio w/ shared desk area
Available: Dec 15, 2014

Looking for 1 ($1100) or possibly 2 ($650 ea) photographers to share 2 co=
nnected spaces in the heart of Williamsburg (near grand and union). Each =
space is roughly 225sf. 24 hour access, excellent heat, ground floor, wif=
i &amp; utilities included.

The first space is a dedicated photo studio. I just took this space over,=
 painted and set it up. Perfect for full length portraits, fashion, still=
 life, tests, etc. It&#39;s clean, simple and nice. 3 roll seamless syste=
m, c-stands, rolling boom, etc. I also have 6 monolights with light modif=
iers you&#39;re welcome to use. We&#39;d work out a suitable shooting sch=
edule

The second space is used as desk/work and storage space. In the picture i=
t&#39;s set up for 2 people but we can arrange accordingly. There&#39;s n=
ot a ton of space for excess storage but we can accommodate some gear, pr=
inters, etc. I have a new Epson 3880 and an Epson R1900 which we can work=
 something out with if you like or BYOPrinter. Space also has a Keurig co=
ffee machine, small fridge, microwave, laser printer, tables, desk chair,=
 and mounting finishing area.=20

Obviously, the space is geared towards photographers but will consider ot=
her artists (video editing, designer, etc. But no toxic materials or musi=
cians). First months rent and 1 month deposit.

There are other 5 other artist spaces and a gallery in front which all wo=
rk very well together. Everyone is quiet, respectful, and motivated. Good=
 manners all around. The front gallery has a monthly curated show and I&#=
39;m considering curating shows in the photostudio about 3-4 times a year=
 in conjunction with the front gallery openings. The neighborhood has goo=
d restaurants and all that good stuff.

We have semi-private space in our beautiful Brooklyn studio, which we cal=

lding slop sink in the building).=20

$600.00 Per Month, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, 200 sq. ft., Charming office/stu=
dio available in prime Greenpoint  (includes utilities)
Available: Jan 01, 2015

A semi-private space is available for sublease in my studio beginning Jan=
uary 1st, approximately 200 square feet for $600, utilities included (hea=
t &amp; electricity). The ceilings are 11 feet high, so it feels larger. =
The entire 600 sq foot studio is shared with two other people - my space =
is in the back and completely private with a door, while your space is in=
 the middle, divided from the other studio with a partial wall, which goe=
s all the way up to the ceiling. There are no windows, but abundant wall =
space and a small storage loft. Perfect for a painter.

The charming space has one exposed brick wall, and original details of wo=
od ceiling, beams and floor. It feels very comfortable and homey in there=
, great place to work. The photos feature my previous studiomates&#39; st=
uff, but it&#39;s best to take a look at it in person and see how you wou=
ld set it up yourself.

There is a freight elevator, mailbox, slop sink, clean bathrooms, and 24-=
hour access to building. Many artists and creative professionals in the b=
uilding.

Amazing, prime location, just 2 blocks from the G at Greenpoint Ave and w=
alking distance to tons of great bars, shops, and restaurants.

I prefer someone with a quiet practice - no woodworking (occasional is ok=
), loud machines, or toxic materials. It&#39;s also preferable if you wor=
k mostly nights and weekends since I work mostly weekdays, but not a requ=
isite. Also, I&#39;m only renting to an individual to keep the # of peopl=
e in the space to a minimum, no duos or groups. I require first month&#39=
;s rent plus 2 months security deposit. The lease is for one year, but if=
 you need to leave before then, you can give me 45 days notice.=20

$500.00 Per Month, Bushwick, Brooklyn, 1500 sq. ft., Sun-filled, high-cei=
ling shared work space 2 blocks from Morgan L
Available: Jan 15, 2014

We&#39;re looking for a warm, respectful artist to join this great open s=
tudio share. It is currently filled with videographers, a photographer, a=
nd an illustrator.  We&#39;re all friends, and we&#39;d like to keep the =
atmosphere very generous and open. We regularly share equipment, and help=
 out with each other&#39;s projects.

The artist-run studio is located in a three-unit building in Bushwick, ju=
st a couple blocks from the Morgan L stop. It&#39;s about 15 minutes to U=
nion Square.

The 1500 square-foot interior and 14-9 foot sloping ceilings, 24-hour acc=
ess and skylight, allows for an airy, easily sharable space. There are ha=
rdwood floors and lots of sunlight.=20

A section of the space, around 400 square ft, is open and available for p=
hoto and video shoots as well as other projects at any time. There is a 9=
-foot seamless mounted support that can be shared for green screen and ma=
ny colored backgrounds.

Each artist has space for a couple desks, shelves, and there is storage a=
vailable. The space is undivided to keep it open and flexible.=20

The current spot open has a view of downtown Manhattan (see the image of =
the desk).

There are many coffee shops and bars within a couple blocks, a 24-hour de=
li is three blocks away (a new 24-hour diner is opening across the street=
), as well as Roberta&#39;s Pizza, Momo Sushi, El Fogon, and so on.

Rent is $500 per month plus utilities, which can range from $20-40 usuall=
y. I wish it wasn&#39;t this expensive, but that&#39;s how the prices are=
 now.

A couch, refrigerator, slop sink, wifi, in-studio bathroom, sky light, ro=
of access, and track lighting make this a great place to work.

Come see it in the evening or on a weekend. The spot is open 1/15/15 or p=
ossibly earlier.=20

It looks a lot larger in person!

$500.00 Per Month, Tribeca, Manhattan, 120 sq. ft., Bright &amp; Airy Sha=
red Studio Sublet
Available: Jan 01, 2015 through Apr 15, 2015

I will be traveling for several months and am subletting my space in a la=
rge, open art studio.  The studio is shared by 5 artists, each with our o=
wn individual workspaces.  The space is incredibly bright, with tons of w=
indows, a community conference table, and a slop sink and bathroom in the=
 studio.  My studio-mates all work in the studio on different schedules, =
so there are rarely more than one or two other people there at the same t=
ime.  They are quiet and respectful and like to keep the space reasonably=
 tidy, as they sometimes have visitors, curators, etc. coming through.  T=
he studio is on the 3rd floor of a walkup building, which is well-maintai=
ned and generally clean.

Please note - I will be storing materials and supplies in the studio, so =
there is only a small amount of storage space for someone subletting.=20

I will be showing the space beginning Monday, December 22.  If you are in=
terested, please let me know the dates you are looking for and a little a=
bout the type of work you will be doing in the studio.  Thanks!

$850.00 Per Month, Clinton Hill/Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, NY, art-minded ladies=
 seeking roommate asap in renovated 4bd/2bath apartment with great light =
and dishwasher!
Available: Dec 16, 2014 through May 31, 2015

We recently moved into a newly renovated apartment and are looking for an=
other roommate!

The apartment: There is an intercom system and a security punch-pad to ge=
t into the building. You can either take the stairs or take the elevator,=
 which opens up right into the apartment (ooh fancy!). There is a nice ne=
w kitchen with granite countertops, oven/stove, refrigerator, sink and di=
shwasher, microwave, toaster oven, juicer, coffee makers, and a breakfast=
 nook. The living room and kitchen area are right near each other, and si=
nce there&#39;s a large bay window it gets lots of light all day. There i=
s also roof access on the tenth floor with great views of the city.
There are two full bathrooms: one includes a standing shower and the othe=
r has a ceramic tub with a sunflower shower head, so at the end of the da=
y no one has to smell like kielbasa and hot trash, which we all know nyc =
does.

There is a laundromat across the street as well as a tasty ice cream plac=
e. There are multiple restaurants/cafes, grocery stores, liquor stores, p=
harmacies, and deli&#39;s nearby. There are two nice public parks within =
a ten minute walk. The closest train is the G at Bedford-Nostrand and the=
re are a bunch of bus lines that run around here also (B38, B54, B44, B52=
) only a few blocks away.

Rent is $850/mo plus utilities (gas/electric/wifi...around $50/month). Th=
e room is a 7ftx9ft, so a twin mattress would fit comfortably with a dres=
ser and chair (you could fit a queen size mattress too, for a more cozy f=
eeling), it has hardwood floors, and no windows. There is a large double =
doored 5.5ft x 2ft lit closet right across from the room for your use.=20=


The roommates: We are three ladies and art/design people in their early t=
wenties. We work, have internships, and like cheese. We like to keep an e=
asy-going household where funky music is played and soup is made and rela=
xation is valued after long days in the studio/job/class. Where the cacti=
 look nice and nobody has lice (seriously). Each of us are usually out an=
d about doing our own thing but enjoy hanging out together too or having =
friends over to make a meal. We are smoker friendly (however no cigarette=
s inside, spliffs welcome), lgbtq friendly, open to all genders, and inte=
rnational people are definitely welcome too. We&#39;re trying to rent the=
 room as soon as possible (especially before everyone heads away for the =
holidays) so we&#39;d love to set up a time to show the space and meet yo=
u this week if possible!

You must be: Clean, respectful, responsible, financially secure, and will=
ing to participate in weekly household cleaning.=20

(sorry photos are not great, please feel free to contact for more info/to=
 see the room)

$1,400.00 Per Month, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, 30 sq. ft., live and work in s=
pacious Greenpoint loft!
Available: Feb 01, 2015

Hello! A group of three roommates is seeking a 4th tenant for our 19th ce=
ntury factory loft , in Greenpoint: 1600 sq feet, 20 ft, pressed tin ceil=
ings, original brick, roof access with an amazing view of Manhattan.

The loft is located on Manhattan Avenue, by McCarren Park, above the famo=
us Peter Pan Donut and Bakery, a ten minute walk from the Bedford L stop,=
 just over Nassau G stop.

We need to fill a furnished 12 x 14 foot bedroom with a nice pretty windo=
w and lots of light. What makes the loft truly special, though, is the va=
st communal and work space available. Our new tenant is welcome to set up=
 a work/studio station in the lofta set designer and photographer/painter=
 currently have work stations set up; our third roommate, a writer/editor=
, doesn&#39;t need oneso you can consider this a live/work situation.

There is enough room to roller skate! There&#39;s also a nice, well equip=
ped kitchen, a living room/sitting area, a piano, and more than enough st=
orage space for everybody.=20

We are very close friends here, but on quite different schedules. We&#39;=
re not often all in the loft at the same time so it is essential, since s=
o much of our space is shared, that our new roommate be clean and respect=
ful.=20

We are looking for one roomie to move in February 1st!

This is a very creative space, perfect for hosting events--we occasionall=

ft out. However we act as your landlords, as well as the loft designers a=
nd caretakers who personally take care of everything. If you have a compl=
aint, we&#39;re on it. If you want custom shelving or a room loft (for a =
bed/storage), we can build it for you at a reasonable rate.

 if you&#39;d like to come by for a viewing next week, or possibly this w=
eekend.=20

loset, 2 windows in Bed-Stuy 2 bd apartment
Available: Dec 23, 2014 through Dec 23, 2015

Hi!
I have a room available in my new 2 bd apartment in the eastern side of B=
ed Stuy.  It&#39;s about 130 sq ft, with a 2 by 4 ft closet and 2 big win=
dows.  The apartment has exposed brick and dark hardwood floors throughou=
t, and central heat and A/C.  It&#39;s on a very quiet block of mostly fa=
mily homes, about a 4 minute walk from the Ralph C train. =20

The building has a washer and dryer in the basement, and room for safe bi=
ke parking.  There room is semi-terraced and is easily accessible.  There=
 are grocery stores, a 24 hour Rite Aid, a nice fruit and vegetable marke=
t, and other stores nearby.  There are some nice cafes and restaurants in=
 the area too.

I have a big sheepdog on weekends named Ralphie, and a cat named Shorty (=
see pix).  Ralphie is very loving and playful.  I hope anyone who is inte=
rested will love my pets!  I work regular daytime hours, and keep a fairl=
y quiet house, but I like some music and some hanging out too.  I have a =
simple but very functional kitchen setup.

The room is $950 / month, plus utilities and deposit.  It&#39;s available=
 now, for short or long term,, but I prefer someone who would like to sta=
y a while.  Write me for any more details- thanks!

$650.00 Per Month, Prospect Lefferts Gardens, Brooklyn, Huge room for ren=
t in great location
Available: Jan 03, 2015

Our roommate is moving out and we need to fill our huge third room by Jan=
uary 15th, or earlier if necessary. We&#39;re two 20-somethings (and a fr=
iendly cat) living basically right across the street from the Prospect Pa=
rk Q/B/S stop. Down the block from Prospect Park. Cute coffee shop across=
 the street, and also another one around the corner. New organic grocery =
store across the street as well. Also bars, restaurants, and laundry all =
very close.=20

The room is huge, but it is a converted living room, so it doesn&#39;t ha=
ve a door as you can see in the pics. But we&#39;re ok with you putting u=
p some kind of door/divider (an accordion type door, maybe?). The guy bef=
ore had a sheet up and that seemed to work fine. Also there&#39;s a futon=
 in there that you can use if you need it. Rent is $650 plus utilities, w=
hich usually run around $40-50 per month. We will also need a 1-month sec=
urity deposit.

Again, room needs to be filled January 15 or sooner, so send us some info=
 about yourself and we can work out a time for you to stop by. Thanks!=20=

V)
You would be on the lease, which goes until August 31 2015. The lease off=

$2,300 - total to move in
$50ish/month - utilities

I have a great room opening up January 1st in a big 5 bed 3 bath apartmen=

The apartment also has a dishwasher, laundry access from our apartment (n=
o going outside in the freezing cold), a private backyard and a nifty bar=

 and it goes to other comment here.

Available: Dec 22, 2014 through Apr 30, 2015

In general:

om in a lovely 2 bedroom Crown Heights apartment. Move in immediately -- =
yours until May 1st, 2015. Unfurnished.

The bedroom measures 11.5&#39; x 13&#39;; golden parquet floors with char=
ming baseboards and molding around the windows. Moderate sized closet, wi=
th hallway closet available for coats and any other items. Features two l=
arge windows with the fire escape attached in front of one -- which I had=
 used to hold a little herb garden and a few flowers. The apartment is on=
 the 3rd floor of a well kept, pre-war building.

Kitchen is narrow yet functional and pretty standard as far as New York a=
partments go. Living room is large and cozy with the same interior moldin=
g details and parquet flooring mentioned above. You would be sharing the =
space with one roommate, Luis, who would be happy to meet any interested =
parties as well. Luis is in his late twenties, rather quiet and quite bus=

with.

. Loads of restaurants, bars, and a yoga collective just up the road at E=
astern Parkway. Cheap laundry mat and bodega is across the street.=20

I&#39;m looking to rent out one furnished bedroom in a lovely two bedroom=
 apartment (rail road style, with a walk around for my room.) in north Wi=
lliamsburg. One bathroom, a big fine kitchen, and a sitting room.

floor we have a skylight in the bathroom and a pretty view out the back o=

 really spectacular, off the Bedford L, and about two blocks from the sub=

t!

You would be sharing the space with me; a twenty something girl working f=
ull time for a contemporary art fair (most every day, 10-7), so the apart=
ment will be fairly quiet. But I&#39;m very easy going and friendly when =
I am around ! If this interests any of you, let me know; shoot me an emai=
l with a little background information, and we can proceed from there. Lo=
oking forward to hearing from you!

$650.00 Per Month, williamsburg, brooklyn, 400-650 sq. ft., apt share, gr=
eat location, not so private, short term, or part time!
Available: Jan 07, 2015 through Feb 05, 2015

Hi, I am looking for someone (1 person only) who needs a place to stay ba=
sically for the month of Jan (about Jan 7 - Feb - ish.), or if you are lo=
oking for a part time crash pad -  It could possibly be extended for the =
right situation at the right time. The apt is a large, (entire - 650 sq f=
t, living area - 400) well located, 1 bedroom, a block from the Williamsb=
urg waterfront (of which I won&#39;t mention ALL the amenities, alas, cho=
ck full of; fun, food, drink, craft, markets, water, people, transport, e=
tc.) My husband will be staying there through Jan as well, so it is a sha=
re. The living room is set up like a studio apt. There may be some wiggle=
 room on who stays where. Hence the price is set affordably for someone t=
o be ok with not so much privacy. You should be a clean, respectful, rela=
xed person who has things to do with them self. You are preferably male. =
This situation is not ok for overnight guests or a couple. I guess it is =
like a longer couch surf, in a pretty nice apt with an equally nice murph=
y bed, ample space and baby steps on the Williamsburg waterfront, so who =
needs to be home anyhow! Well to get warm! It is warm, comfy and brightly=
 decorated. Let me know your situation and if we can make it work.=20

I&#39;ll be traveling to Australia for 2 months with a chance I may exten=
d to three. The room/studio is available on the 10th of Jan. This space i=

rtist or a designer working from home or someone who just wants a lot of =
space to play. It is fully furnished, inducing a comfortable queen size b=

 home, it will feel like one within itself. I have my studio and living q=
uarters in the basement with enough natural light to wake you in the morn=
ing. You will also have access to a large and private backyard from the b=
asement.=20

You will be living with two creative, busy and friendly folks, one female=
 and the other male and both in their mid thirties. They will not ask you=
 for much, but they will ask that you share their standard on an open, fr=
iendly and respectful home. They are queer friendly, sex positive individ=
ual so you can come as you are. We like to keep the home tidy and drama f=
ree. The home is also fully furnished, with an awesome record collection =
and projector.=20

We also have two friendly indoor cats, who will want some of your attenti=
on and most likely want to sleep with you. Without saying, a cat friendly=
 person is a must!=20

Bushwich is a diverse and fun neighborhood. You&#39;ll be in walking dist=
ance from the L, M and J, along with great restaurants, bars and gallerie=
s.=20

If you are interested, I&#39;d be happy to answer further questions or to=
 meet in person. Couples are welcome for an extra $100 per month to cover=
 utilities.=20

$1400/monthly is inclusive of all utilities.

$1,600.00 Per Month, Prospect Heights/Clinton Hill border, Brooklyn, Cozy=
, quiet, sunny bedroom and office/studio!
Available: Jan 01, 2015

1.5 bedrooms available in a 2.5 bedroom apartment. Great location on the =
border between Clinton Hill and Prospect Heights, right by the C train at=
 Clinton-Washington, and only a 10 minute walk to Atlantic Center with al=
l the trains. Also great location for bikers, and there is bike storage i=
n the building.

This is ideal for somebody who needs an office or studio. The apartment i=
s currently unfurnished but will be fully furnished by move-in time. If y=
ou would like to bring any of your own furniture that&#39;s cool too. You=
 will have the two rooms at the back of the apartment (in the photos, the=
 one with mauve colored walls and the one with red walls), overlooking th=
e garden (we don&#39;t have access to the garden, but it&#39;s a nice vie=
w!). The rooms are extremely quiet and peaceful and cozy.=20

Also, bonus: this unit has a washing machine!! It&#39;s a combo washer/dr=
yer in one, which means that it&#39;s not the best dryer, so most stuff w=
ould have to be hung dry anyway. But there are also several laundromats w=
ithin walking distance if you really need a strong dryer.=20

You will be sharing the apartment with a 30yo theatre artist and educator=
. I work in Dumbo most days of the week, but work from home Wednesday mor=
nings and occasionally have Fridays off. I enjoy biking and adventuring a=
round the city, cooking and baking, hosting potlucks and dinner parties, =
crafting, playing cards, spending time outdoors, etc. I&#39;d love to liv=
e with someone who I can vibe with, someone who lives life fully and is i=
nterested in connecting and community!

If you are interested, please email me with the following information:
1. Full name
2. Contact info
3. How long you&#39;re interested in staying
4. Tell me something about yourself that would give me a good sense of wh=
o you are - what makes you tick, why you&#39;re interested in this apartm=
ent, how you&#39;re interested in being in the space.=20
5. Tell me a few times you might be available to meet up and see the plac=
e.

$2,690.00 Per Month, East Harlem, New York, Unique East Harlem 2 BR/1.5BA=
 Duplex (convertible to 3 BR) (with private patio, roof deck)
Available: Jan 01, 2015

Rent: $2690/month. No fee.=20
Bedrooms: 2 (convertible to 3)
Bathrooms: 1.5
Available: Jan. 1 or sooner -- for 8 months (the rest of our lease) or fo=
r longer

Location: 164 East 112th Street (btw. 3rd &amp; Lexington). The apartment=
 is on the ground floor, in the back -- makes for a very easy move in.=20=


Commuting: It&#39;s 2 blocks from the 6 train 110th street stop -- very c=
onvenient to get out and get on the subway in the morning. We are also a =
few avenues over from the 2/3 110th street stop (about a 10 minute walk).=


Why it&#39;s great:=20
On the main level: both bedrooms, the kitchen and dining area, a closet f=
or coats, and the main bathroom (which has a lovely stand-up glass-enclos=
ed shower). Off one bedroom is a private patio area which is really lovel=
y. Both bedrooms have big spacious closets and easily fit a queen bed (or=
 larger).

There&#39;s also a huge lower level that can be converted to a 3rd bedroo=
m OR used as a living room, guest room, rec room, office, etc. -- and als=
o has a decent-sized half-bathroom.

From that level there&#39;s access to the basement of the building with e=
asy bike storage, laundry room, trash &amp; recycling, as well as additio=
nal storage for the unit.

The apt also has central a/c and heating and brand new appliances (includ=
ing a dishwasher), access to a gym in the building next door, and a very =
big rooftop decked out with nice furniture.

We are breaking our lease because one of us had to move out of New York u=
nexpectedly, but we really wish we could have stayed -- it is a fabulous =
place and we can&#39;t say enough nice things about it, the building, or =
the landlord.=20

This place is ideal for a family or for roommates. For the amount of spac=
e you get, this is a real bargain. I am not a broker. I am one of the cur=
rent tenants but I am not currently living there (I have moved into anoth=
er apartment). Again, one of our roommates unexpectedly had to move out o=
f NYC and my other roommate and I could not afford to stay in the apartme=
nt, so we are breaking the lease. The landlord is happy to have you sign =
a lease for as few as 8 months (the remainder of our lease) or longer (i.=
e., a year or more).

ark Zoo and Brooklyn Botanic Garden are a five minute walk. Prospect Park=
 station B/Q/S trains are two minutes away. There are bountiful new coffe=
e shops, restaurants, bars, and shopping within five minutes from the apa=
rtment and Park Slope / Prospect Heights / Crown Heights are one stop awa=
y. My wife and I are the owners and we have just vacated the space to mov=
e to Florida; the space is available indefinitely. The odds of us re-occu=
pying the apartment are very low and we will likely hold on to it as a pe=
rsonal investment. We are not brokers; this is our only rental property. =
As for showing, unless its done today, the super in the building will sho=
w the apartment; great guy! The idea tenant will pull their own credit sc=
ore(s), and verify income to show that the rent is 30% or less of their m=
onthly post tax income. Credit score should be great, but we&#39;ll deal =
with every situation on a case by case basis. Identification will be requ=
ired as well. There are no additional fees, except that the tenant will b=
e responsible for paying the electricity and stove/oven gas bills. Heat a=
nd hot water is included. Laundry in the building also costs $2 to wash a=
nd $1.75 to dry. I think that covers everything. We&#39;re just decent pe=
ople looking for good tenants who will take care of our place and pay the=
ir rent on time.

$2,300.00 Per Month, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, Large Greenpoint sublet with y=
ard, flexible dates.
Available: Jan 25, 2015 through Aug 20, 2015




Large Greenpoint sublet with yard, flexible dates.
Second floor of a three-family near McGorlick Park.
For one or two responsible people.

Begin date: any time between January 25, 2015 and February 15.
End date: any time between July 15 and August 25.

It&#39;s a spacious floor-through, not a &quot;true&quot; two bedroom. Tw=
o separate entrances, six windows, four large rooms, one smaller room, in=
ternet, and a shared backyard. You are welcome to garden in the backyard =
along with third-floor neighbor. I&#39;m the owner and this is my own apa=
rtment, fully furnished, with linen, kitchen stuff, etc. The apartment ha=
sn&#39;t been renovated since 1987, but it&#39;s held up well.  However, =
the house is old, cranky, but charming. I was away for twenty years, retu=
rned two years ago.

Rent is $2300/month. First, last, and security with signing of lease.

The neighborhood is sweet, quiet, and very safe. There&#39;s a laundromat=
 on the corner and many coffee shops, restaurants, and mom &amp; pop groc=
ers nearby. You can walk to Williamsburg in 15 minutes, join the exciteme=
nt, and return to tranquility. The Nassau Ave. G-subway stop is .6 miles =
away and the Graham Ave. L stop is .9 mile&#39;s away. The B48 bus stops =
at my corner and takes you straight to the Lorimer L-train. A taxi to or =
from Penn Station is about $22 + tip, less if you&#39;re going downtown. =
But for local travel, biking is best.

I will probably not respond to every inquiry. I apologize in advance for =
this.

Thanks=20

This was my parents&#39; house for about 50 years. For the past 5 years m=

k out a reverse mortgage to pay for my mother&#39;s care, and now trying =
to sell it for the amount of the reverse mortgage, hoping the mortgage co=
mpany will accept the deed to the house in lieu of foreclosure. This is a=

ial butterfly living 1 1/2 hrs away in the Catskill Mts near Woodstock. I=
&#39;d imagine a potential buyer would speed up the process of our relinq=
uishing the house, which has a nice layout, &amp; lots of character.

Park Slope, Brooklyn, 550 sq. ft., Park Slope brownstone 1-bed avail for =
swap (LA only) or rent
Available: Feb 01, 2015 through Mar 09, 2015

I&#39;m a freelance design journalist with a spacious one-bedroom apartme=
nt in a Park Slope, Brooklyn, brownstone, right by the Atlantic Terminal =
station (every major express train -- one stop to Manhattan). I&#39;m int=
erested in spending about a month in LA, most likely from around February=
 7 to March 7 (flexible). Central/East LA preferred -- Silver Lake, Echo =
Park, Hollywood, Downtown, etc. Or, if you don&#39;t live in LA and want =
to rent my place for a month, that would also be an option!=20

The apartment is up one flight of stairs, is nicely decorated, has a flat=
screen TV and wi-fi, has a fully stocked kitchen, and a bathtub. It also =
gets tons of light!

kitchen with granite countertops, oven/stove, refrigerator, sink and dish=

tchen area are right near each other, and since there&#39;s a large bay w=
indow it gets lots of light all day. There is also roof access on the ten=
th floor with great views of the city. <br>
There are two full bathrooms: one includes a standing shower and the othe=
r has a ceramic tub with a sunflower shower head, so at the end of the da=
y no one has to smell like kielbasa and hot trash, which we all know nyc =
does.</p><p>There is a laundromat across the street as well as a tasty ic=
e cream place. There are multiple restaurants/cafes, grocery stores, liqu=
or stores, pharmacies, and deli&#39;s nearby. There are two nice public p=
arks within a ten minute walk. The closest train is the G at Bedford-Nost=
rand and there are a bunch of bus lines that run around here also (B38, B=
54, B44, B52) only a few blocks away.</p><p>Rent is $850/mo plus utilitie=
s (gas/electric/wifi...around $50/month). The room is a 7ftx9ft, so a twi=
n mattress would fit comfortably with a dresser and chair (you could fit =
a queen size mattress too, for a more cozy feeling), it has hardwood floo=
rs, and no windows.=20
There is a large double doored 5.5ft x 2ft lit closet right across from t=

</p><p>The roommates: We are three ladies and art/design people in their =
early twenties. We work, have internships, and like cheese. We like to ke=
ep an easy-going household where funky music is played and soup is made a=
nd relaxation is valued after long days in the studio/job/class. Where th=
e cacti look nice and nobody has lice (seriously). Each of us are usually=
 out and about doing our own thing but enjoy hanging out together too or =
having friends over to make a meal. We are smoker friendly (however no ci=
garettes inside, spliffs welcome), lgbtq friendly, open to all genders, a=
nd international people are definitely welcome too. We&#39;re trying to r=

movie theaters, the park, etc. The apartment is only 2 blocks from the Sm=

small dresser and clothing rack included in the room for no additional ch=
arge. The bed is also available if needed, price negotiable. <br>
The second room is smaller (6 1/2x12), with one window and an AC unit and=
 makes a great study room/studio. My boyfriend and I have used it as such=
 over the last year. It is $650 per month. We are hoping to either have a=
 second person take this room, or have one person take both rooms for $14=

I have a room available in my new 2 bd apartment in the eastern side of B=
ed Stuy. It&#39;s about 130 sq ft, with a 2 by 4 ft closet and 2 big wind=

 and central heat and A/C. It&#39;s on a very quiet block of mostly famil=
y homes, about a 4 minute walk from the Ralph C train.=20
</p><p>The building has a washer and dryer in the basement, and room for =
safe bike parking. There room is semi-terraced and is easily accessible. =
There are grocery stores, a 24 hour Rite Aid, a nice fruit and vegetable =
market, and other stores nearby. There are some nice cafes and restaurant=
s in the area too.</p><p>I have a big sheepdog on weekends named Ralphie,=
 and a cat named Shorty (see pix). Ralphie is very loving and playful. I =
hope anyone who is interested will love my pets! I work regular daytime h=
ours, and keep a fairly quiet house, but I like some music and some hangi=
ng out too. I have a simple but very functional kitchen setup.</p><p>The =
room is $950 / month, plus utilities and deposit. It&#39;s available now,=
 for short or long term,, but I prefer someone who would like to stay a w=
hile. Write me for any more details- thanks!...=20

/p><p>Hello, <br>
 I am currently living in a spacious 2 bedroom railroad apartment in Bed-=
Stuy. I will have one room available from January 1st until the 16th wher=
e my girlfriend comes back from Europe. The room will also be available a=
gain on April. <br>
This is a fully furnished railroad apartment on the top floor. Only 3 blo=
cks away from the J train (Halsey station) and a couple more to the C tra=
in (Ralph). Laundry mat is 1 block down, 2 supermarkets 2 blocks down, bu=
nch of restaurants, 24/7 Ride Aid, bodegas in every corner and post offic=
es are just few of the neighborhoods stores. <br>
Now about the apartment! You can have the room that is currently the livi=
ng room which means more privacy too! The apartment is in great shape and=
 has two entrance doors, 3 rooms, a Huge kitchen, plenty of closet space =
and very nice bathroom overall it is a very spacious and clean apartment!=
 The sofa bed is queen sized and price includes everything (Wi-Fi, gas, h=
eat and electricity). Place is always warm in the winter. <br>
Now few things about me and what I am looking for. I am an artist, who wo=
rks and is in an out all the time. The one extra room we have I use for d=
rawing. I am looking for somebody preferably a guy that works, is an arti=
st (but not necessarily), is clean and like things be in order (I may con=
sider couples too). My party days are way over so I am expecting someone =
in a similar page or one who takes the party elsewhere if you know what I=
 mean. In general the time I am home I either spend it in peace by either=
 drawing, chilling or cooking. <br>
the room will be available from Jan 1st - Jan 16th for $250 per week + a =
security deposit and from April 1st - September 30th for $875 a month + s=

basically for the month of Jan (about Jan 7 - Feb - ish.), or if you are =
looking for a part time crash pad - It could possibly be extended for the=
 right situation at the right time. The apt is a large, (entire - 650 sq =

burg waterfront (of which I won&#39;t mention ALL the amenities, alas, ch=
ock full of; fun, food,=20
drink, craft, markets, water, people, transport, etc.) My husband will be=
 staying there through Jan as well, so it is a share. The living room is =
set up like a studio apt. There may be some wiggle room on who stays wher=
e. Hence the price is set affordably for someone to be ok with not so muc=
h privacy. You should be a clean, respectful, relaxed person who has thin=
gs to do with them self. You are preferably male. This situation is not o=
k for overnight guests or a couple. I guess it is like a longer couch sur=
f, in a pretty nice apt with an equally nice murphy bed, ample space and =
baby steps on the Williamsburg waterfront, so who needs to be home anyhow=
! Well to get warm! It is warm, comfy and brightly decorated. Let me know=

. The apartment is on the ground floor, in the back -- makes for a very e=

treet stop -- very convenient to get out and get on the subway in the mor=
ning. We are also a few avenues over from the 2/3 110th street stop (abou=
t a 10 minute walk).</p><p>Why it&#39;s great: <br>
On the main level: both bedrooms, the kitchen and dining area, a closet f=
or coats, and the main bathroom (which has a lovely stand-up glass-enclos=
ed shower). Off one bedroom is a private patio area which is really lovel=
y. Both bedrooms have big spacious closets and easily fit a queen bed (or=
 larger).</p><p>There&#39;s also a huge lower level that can be converted=
 to a 3rd bedroom OR used as a living room, guest room, rec room, office,=
 etc. -- and also has a decent-sized half-bathroom.</p><p>From that level=
 there&#39;s access to the basement of the building with easy bike storag=
e, laundry room, trash &amp; recycling, as well as additional storage for=
 the unit.</p><p>The apt also has central a/c and heating and brand new a=
ppliances (including a dishwasher), access to a gym in the building next =
door, and a very big rooftop decked out with nice furniture.</p><p>We are=
 breaking our lease=20
because one of us had to move out of New York unexpectedly, but we really=
 wish we could have stayed -- it is a fabulous place and we can&#39;t say=
 enough nice things about it, the building, or the landlord. </p><p>This =
place is ideal for a family or for roommates. For the amount of space you=
 get, this is a real bargain. I am not a broker. I am one of the current =
tenants but I am not currently living there (I have moved into another ap=
artment). Again, one of our roommates unexpectedly had to move out of NYC=
 and my other roommate and I could not afford to stay in the apartment, s=
o we are breaking the lease. The landlord is happy to have you sign a lea=
se for as few as 8 months (the remainder of our lease) or longer (i.e., a=
 year or more)....=20

 will be required as well. There are no additional fees, except that the =
tenant will be responsible for paying the electricity and stove/oven gas =
bills. Heat and hot water is included. Laundry in the building also costs=
 $2 to wash and $1.75 to dry. I think that covers everything. We&#39;re j=
