Alarms & Controls' "Clovis Points" Now Available For Pre-order

Alarms & Controls' debut LP, Clovis Points, is out next week via =20
Dischord/Lovitt and is now available for pre-order. Those who order =20
Clovis Points on LP before the November 19th release date will receive =20=

a free copy of the band's 7" single, Reanimus Cataract b/w Kirtland's =20=

Warbler .

Pre-order Alarms & Controls' Clovis Points here

Alarms & Controls formed in Washington, D.C. during the fall of 2010. =20=

The band's roots go back further, though, to 2003, when guitarist =20
Chris Hamley (Circus Lupus, Antimony) and drummer Vin Novara (The =20
Crownhate Ruin, 1.6 Band) were performing in an ensemble accompanying =20=

Nitrate Hymnal, a post-rock opera created by writer/composer Bob =20
Massey. After the production closed, they decided to try writing some =20=

songs together, but the project dissolved after only a few practices. =20=

It wasn't until eight years later =97 when Hamley finally returned to =20=

Novara's house to retrieve his amplifier =97 that they decided to give =20=

it another go, eventually recruiting Michael Honch to play bass.

Clovis Points is the band's first full-length =97 11 songs recorded in =20=

2012 at the Magpie Cage in Baltimore with J. Robbins (Jawbox, Office =20
of Future Plans). Hamley and Novara have been active members of the =20
D.C. music community since the '90s and on Clovis Points, they make an =20=

effort to re-approach the sounds of that moment from a fresh =20
perspective. Where their previous bands were guided by a dark, =20
borderline industrial aesthetic, Alarms & Controls' music favors =20
organic and naturalistic imagery.

Following the recording sessions, Honch left the group to pursue a =20
graduate degree, handing bass duties over to Arthur Noll.
