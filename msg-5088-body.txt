Dear Alexander,
 
Welcome!  Thanks for opening your account on the ApplyWeb
system.  You'll find many helpful features as you complete
forms based on this system. This email refers to your new
username of 'dinsmorealex@gmail.com'.

If you should lose your password you can get a new password at:

   https://www.applyweb.com/public/lostpass.cgi?svag
 
Security
 
      All information you enter is entered securely under
      your private username and password (the one you
      just established).
 
      Also, all the data you enter is encrypted before it
      is transmitted over the web. Notice the closed lock
      (or unbroken key) at the lower left corner of your
      browser window. This icon confirms that the information
      you enter is encrypted before it is transmitted over
      the web.
 
Multi-session Form Completion
 
      Since ApplyWeb lets you save your data, you don't have
      to complete a form in one sitting or from the same
      computer.  You can start the form from this computer,
      work on the next section a week later from the library,
      counselor's office or elsewhere.

Secure Payments
 
      If an application you complete with this account has an 
      application fee, that application fee is paid on-line with
      a credit card or an electronic check. There is no charge 
      for creating your account, completing an application that
      does not have a fee associated with it, or working on a fee-
      based application prior to submitting it.

      Your credit card or check information is encrypted before
      it is transmitted over the web, and it is not stored
      anywhere on the ApplyWeb server.

We hope you enjoy your experience!
