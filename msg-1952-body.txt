Read Between the Lines

Curated by Micaela Giovannotti

Reception: Wednesday, September 26, from 6-8 pm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New works by Daniele Genadry, Shanti Grumbine, So Yoon Lym, Kymia Nawabi, Felix 
Plaza, Linda Plotkin, David Rios Ferreira, and Julian Wellisz

Lower East Side Printshop is pleased to present Read Between the Lines guest curated
by Micaela Giovanotti, an independent art curator and critic. The exhibition will
be on view at the Printshop from September 12 - November 4, 2012 with a reception
on Wednesday, September 26, from 6-8pm.

So often the massive amount of information received on a daily basis prevents us
 from dissecting and absorbing the more profound layers of meaning embedded within
images and text. Given that we are used to decoding language and icons, it is certainly
convenient and momentarily fulfilling to gather enough knowledge from that first
 encounter without moving any further.

The works in the group exhibition Read Between the Lines, all from artists currently
in residence at at the Printshop, encourage the audience to develop a longer and
 deeper relationship with the images on view.

Some of the works formally exploit the lines in printed media to concurrently disguise
and reveal, as in the prints of Shanti Grumbine, Julian Wellisz, and Daniele Genadry.
In David Rios Ferreira's and Linda Plotkin's oeuvre, the abstract graphic elements
instead look fragmented and are on a quest to be contextualized.

Felix Plaza's consumerist shopping bags are devoid of interior contents that need
to be provided, whereas So Yoon Lym's disconnected tattooed limbs present themselves
aggressively on an enigmatic, narrative triptych, and Kymia Nawabi's couple in Nook
(2012) cuddle, arms outstretched toward each other, in an attempt to embrace an 
evanescent bubble.

Exhibition on view September 12 through November 4, 2012

Hours: weekdays from 10 am - 6 pm, and weekends from 12 - 6 pm.
Free and open to the public.
