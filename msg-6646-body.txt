Dear Alex,

Tomorrow night, beginning between the hours of 8 PM - 4 AM MST, we will be performing a kernel update on your server.  We estimate the outage to be approximately 15-30 minutes.  During this time, your email, website and account will not be accessible.  This updated kernel brings further enhancements and fixes in all aspects of the kernel, the integral part of which the rest of the Operating System relies upon.

We apologize that we cannot give you an exact time-frame between these 8 hours as to when you will experience the downtime due to the number of additional servers we will be performing this update on as well.

Should you have any questions or concerns regarding this planned outage, please contact support.
