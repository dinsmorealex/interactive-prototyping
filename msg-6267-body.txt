Available: Apr 01, 2014

Hi. We have a room opening up in our live-work space. There is ample light, lots of shared space, and high ceilings with lofts that we have built. Though this is a live-in space, we focus on using it for working, and are looking for people who will be mindful of that. We are painters and musicians.  Two of us are students who spend a lot of time at home on class work.  We are a co-ed group in our early 30s, and we have a cat. The room is approximately 12x12 with windows overlooking the main floor.  The place is clean but not perfect, so you should be able to handle a little clutter, but also be responsible. It is a very comfortable place to work.

Please Read Carefully:
Please be aware that this is a live/work space and is used as such so (if interested) you should be open to occasional...

Hello!! I am looking for 1 or 2 roommates who are interested in looking for a live/work loft space in Bushwick with me. Ideally for me the place would function as a large shared studio with smaller lofted bed/bedroom areas for each of us. I work in fashion as a teacher at a regular part--time job and as freelance on the side and have a steady art practice of my own that is developing. I really need the space to let this keep developing and can't afford a separate room to rent and a studio space in this city on my own right now. I would like to share a space with other easy going/responsible/stable people so we can all have space to allow our work to develop and have the set up that we desire to do this.

We are a professional couple who has been living in the heart of Williamsburg for years and would like to find a large, charming, light-filled 2- or 3-bedroom apartment in a quieter, less &quot;buzzy&quot; neighborhood in Brooklyn or Queens. We come with excellent references, no pets and solid financials.

We're suckers for charming, peaceful, roomy, well cared-for spaces and are looking for something unfurnished for the long term. Please let us know if you have something you think we'd like. Our move-in date is flexible, but we'd prefer June 1 or thereabouts.

$1,560.00 Per Month, Any, Manhattan or Brooklyn, Two Females Seeking 2/bdrm Temporary Sublet
Available: May 01, 2014

Hi there, my name is Lysette, and my good friend/partner, Ashley, and I are looking for a 2-bedroom temporary sublet (up to 6 months), ideally starting May 1st (but could maybe negotiate for starting a couple weeks prior).  It could be 2 rooms in any size apartment, or a straight-up 2-bedroom.
A little about us: I'm a writer, freelance book art designer, and part-time nanny! I finished my MFA in Creative Writing at Brooklyn College last year.  Ashley is a yoga instructor and does real estate law.  We also both perform improv and write sketch comedy for the Upright Citizens Brigade theatre :) Neither of us smoke or drink, so you wouldn't have to worry about any party-type people living in your place! Of course whatever other people/roomies want to do is completely fine; we just don't do...

I'm a 26-year old photographer currently living in Seattle and have plans to move to NY for the months of April and May...possibly a little bit of June. A little more about myself...as I mentioned earlier I'm a photographer and I travel a ton! I work from home or in coffee shops but I'm pretty quiet and in the zone while I'm working in my room. I do love to explore and just be outside as much as I can :) I'm a pretty laid-back person. I really enjoy pretty much everything.

$2,500.00 Per Month, Brooklyn / Manhattan, Brooklyn / NYC, Small family looking for a 3 month fall sublet
Available: Sept 01, 2014 through Dec 21, 2014

We are a small Swedish family consisting of Ida and Kristoffer (29 yo) and Jane (8 months). We both work as freelance writers and have decided to spend the fall in our favorite city, rather then rainy Stockholm!
Dates: Something like september to december (we probably want to go home for Christmas), but we can be flexible on dates if we find the right place!

We are looking for a place in a friendly neighbourhood, close to coffee shops (were we can work), parks and fresh air. Ideal would be a Williamsburg-ish area.
Also, since Jane will be entering toddlerdom during the time of the stay, it is crucial that the flat is child-safe (no mold, no super hot heaters, no super expensive things that can be broken...). A properly equipped kitchen where we can cook would be nice. If you (like us)...

Hello
I'm currently looking for a space in which to build and shoot a set for a short student film. The film is a comedy about two people who accidentally rob a bank at the same time. Small Time Crooks meets Peep Show.

I'm looking for a Basement, Garage or Studio space, minimum of 20' x 20'. Ideally I'd be able to have access to the space for about a week, which would include building and set dressing and also a day's filming. It is a student film affiliated with a large University and so would be  comprehensively insured. Our budget is pretty meagre but I could offer in the region of $150-200. I'm happy to consider other offers if the space seems perfect. Alternatively, what we lack in budget we make up for in time and access to equipment. I'd be more than happy to make a short...
