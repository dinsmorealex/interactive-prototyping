Hello, List!
Here are the listings as of Oct 29, 2014.


Listings Project Story of the Week:

Stephanie, nice notes. I'll get into the dashboard and edit the posting a=
 bit per your suggestions. Your vetting has been great from where I sit, =
and has helped me find like minded and reliable tenants in the past. I ev=
en made a friends and may be working with someone despite the fact that h=
e didn't end up renting my place. Silver lining of sorts, to being away f=
rom home and the rest of the mishegas in my life. So again, thank you. -S=
haroz


Best,
Stephanie

$600.00 Per Month, East Williamsburg/Bushwick, Brooklyn, 200 sq. ft., 200=
 and 385 sq. ft artist work studios for rent in newly renovated artist ru=
n gallery/printshop
Available: Nov 01, 2014

Present Company (www.present-co.com) is an artist run gallery led by Chad=
 Stayrook, Jose Ruiz, and Brian Balderston. We recently signed a 5 year l=
ease on a new 4000 sq ft space at 254 Johnson Avenue and are renting out =
6 studios:

Five 200 sq ft. studios at $600
One 375 sq ft. studio at $950

Each private studio has it&#39;s own lockable entrance, 9ft ceilings, ded=
icated lighting, and 4-8 electrical outlets. There is heating and air con=
ditioning and two large ventilation fans. In the common areas there are 2=
 slop sinks, a bathroom, and small kitchenette (fridge, microwave, coffee=
 pot). There is a loading dock and direct access to the studio floor from=
 the street. Renters have 24 hour access and all utilities and wifi is in=
cluded in the rent. Additionally, renters get a 15% discount at the in-ho=
use inkjet printing company Furthermore (www.furthermorellc.com) for the =
duration of their lease.

The building is 1.5 blocks from the Montrose L stop and there are tons of=
 restaurants and bars near by. It&#39;s also walking distance to many bus=
hwick galleries including Signal which is 2 doors down. Present Company p=
resents 6 or so exhibitions a year along with many special events/screeni=
ngs/performances so there is always a lively atmosphere in the space.

Shares are fine. Longer leases (6 months to a year or longer) are preferr=
ed but we will consider short term. The space is currently under construc=
tion so I only have sketchup images and mid-work images. Studios should b=
e complete by the end of this week and ready to rent November 1st. 1st mo=
nth plus 1 month security deposit to move in. Send an email for more info=
rmation or to set up a site visit.

$1,400.00 Per Month, Clinton Hill/Navy Yard, Brooklyn, Plenty Of Spaces A=
vailable In Beautiful Newly Renovated Bldg! Huge Range Of Sizes/Prices Av=
ailable!
Available: Aug 01, 2014

To anyone looking for a great new studio space to work in, I have been as=
ked to refer you to a new art studio project. I&#39;ve had my studio in t=
he same building for many years now, and it truly is a wonderful place to=
 work!=20

Because it&#39;s a brand new build out, there are many different spaces a=
vailable. The prices begin at $1025-$1350 for the medium-large ones. All =
have massive windows, and and are perfect size for sharing.

And then there are the truly enormous spaces with FAR more space and even=
 more windows. These range anywhere from $1400 - $4000.=20

Each space will have plenty of light and ventilation, as well as a heat a=
nd AC unit in every space. The building also provides gorgeous rooftop vi=
ews, 24 hour access and security, and an enormous loading dock and freigh=
t elevator.=20

For those not familiar with the area, it&#39;s generally thought of as a =
safe, quiet Brooklyn neighborhood. The building is just a few blocks from=
 the G train, with plenty of food options and easy street parking.

I have had my own art studio in this building for almost 4 years, and the=
 management has asked me to help get interest in the new spaces as they a=
re expanding the number of studios in the building. I will be the one sho=
wing the spaces and there are absolutely NO fees involved.

If you&#39;re interested, please text Jordan. I look forward to hearing f=
rom you. Thanks!

$750.00 Per Month, Bushwick, Brooklyn, 400 sq. ft., Sunny Studio with Wal=

Available: Nov 03, 2014 through Jun 30, 2015

Studio Sublet info=20
Beautiful wall-of-windows studio with view and light
I will be using my studio very sparingly over the next 8 months or more a=
nd I am seeking someone who would like to share the space with me. There =
is also the possibility to stay on after 8 months, when I am back in ther=
e more regularly, if we both decide that would work. The timeframe of the=
 share has some flexibility as to when it begins and ends, so if you have=
 specific parameters, please let me know and I may be able to work with t=
hat. I am open to discussing the possibility of a month to month sublet a=
s well.=20
Most of my belongings will be stored behind a sliding wall, so they will =
be out of sight. I will retain one corner of the studio with a work table=
 and some power tools stored underneath it and may come in occasionally t=
o do some work, although it is unlikely.=20
Your portion would be 300sf of the 400:=20
80 sf will be my items in storage behind the wall, out of site.=20
300sf will be yours, which includes one full wall and one half wall.=20
Your portion of the rent is 750 plus a portion of the utilities. You will=
 have the place to yourself 99% of the time as I will be using it primari=
ly as a storage only.=20
If we decide to share the space after 8 months, it will be divided evenly=
 and your rent will go down to reflect that.=20
117 Grattan is a large studio building that has recently changed owners a=
nd there is the possibility that the rent could go up somewhat within the=
 next year. I am waiting for more information about this and I would disc=
uss this and give advance notice to the sublet/share and we would discuss=
 what the arrangement should be at that point.=20
I posted this listing three weeks ago and had some great responses which =
I was not able to follow up on due to work, which is why I am posting thi=
s again -so feel free to contact me again.
The building is all art studios and small business, but no band practice =
space inquiries please.

$250.00 Per Month, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, NY, 600 sq. ft., Co-Working Sp=
ace For Creatives, Your Own Desk/Work Area
Available: Nov 07, 2014

Hi, I&#39;m renting desk/work areas in a co-working space in Williamsburg=
. The desks are for writers, theatre makers, and other creatives who want=
 to have their own desk and locking desk storage within a space with a fi=
xed group of people (As opposed to a co-working space for a desk-share in=
 a space made for having more traffic.).

The room is in a building between the Graham L and the Grand L, about an =
8 minute walk from either. The building has I think nineteen other spaces=
 for mostly painters, sculptors, photographers, film folks, etc., and the=
re will also soon be a restaurant or cafe on the ground floor. There are =
shared restrooms in the hall.

The room has a high ceiling, exposed brick walls, hardwood floor, and lar=
ge windows which get a lot of light. I&#39;m putting in a couch/hang out =
space, plants, a coffee machine, a sink, mugs &amp; plates. I&#39;ll have=
 coffee and pastries each day for folks, and a refrigerator.

Everyone will have their own key to the room, a key to their locking stor=
age at their desk, and a key to the front entrance of the building.

There are three different sized areas:
There are desks facing windows for 250 a month, larger desks for 350 a mo=
nth, and larger, corner L-shaped spaces for 400 a month.

The landlord for the overall building is terrific. She&#39;s a young a te=
rrific painter who runs a couple of buildings in the area and I think has=
 helped make a sense of community building around there.

Let me know if you or anyone you&#39;d recommend might be interested and =
I can show the space sometime. I&#39;d love to get writers and creatives =
who are friendly and serious about their work. I don&#39;t have a specifi=
c sort of vision for the space right now past it just being a nice place =
to write and possibly mingle at times.

Best,
Loren

lable in Quiet Part of Lower East Side -- Laid back roommates
Available: Dec 01, 2014 through Nov 30, 2015

Large room available in spacious 3 bedroom apartment in Lower East Side M=
anhattan to be filled December 1.=20

Room includes spacious closet. It is messy in the photos but would be muc=
h cleaner when unfurnished. The apartment itself is fully renovated with =
all new appliances.

Rent is $1150/mo and utilities (gas/electric and wifi) run about $50. Fir=
st, last and security are required to move in. We are ideally looking for=
 someone for a long term sublet--a year is best. Room will be unfurnished=
 although the living room has a couch and bookshelf.

Roommates are a lovable, curious Cornish Rex cat named Frank and two twen=
ty-something girls looking for a friendly, mature, creative, responsible,=
 twenty-something, preferably female to share their home. We would prefer=
 if you like cats as Frank likes a lot of attention. We both work in crea=

omes--which I&#39;m sure a lot of people SAY, but we mean it. We keep it =
tidy, not perfect. We get it cleaned about once a month otherwise we do t=
he cleaning. We just like nice people, they can do whatever they please h=
ave over whoever they want. It is a cozy three bedroom and we all share a=
 bathroom. =20

Apartment is located on Ridge Street, a bit quieter than most streets on =

omats, bars, and restaurants, as well as a 6 minute walk to the F, J, M, =
Z.

Serious inquiries only please. Please respond with a bit about yourself a=

$900.00 Per Month, Ditmas Park (near Prospect Park), Brooklyn, 1080 sq. f=
t., Quiet Roommate Wanted for Huge Renovated Brooklyn Apartment
Available: Dec 01, 2014

I am looking for a female roommate with whom to share an enormous and bea=
utiful Pre-War apartment within walking distance of Prospect Park. This i=
s an ideal situation for a writer, academic, or other professional who sp=
ends most of their time at home working or relaxing quietly. With the rig=
ht person, it could be fun to have a library/coffee shop work vibe in nue=
stra casa.

About the space:
The available bedroom includes a full closet, high ceilings, 2 windows, a=
nd hardwood floors. The entire space was remodeled within the last 15 yea=
rs and is in excellent condition with a big living room *and* separate di=
ning room as well as a kitchen that could be adapted to suit someone with=
 some amount of culinary ambition.
So, the apartment is *huge*, and because there is so much room in the com=
mon area, a dedicated work space could be negotiated. Oh, and you would j=
ust share it with ONE person.

Me:
I ...=20
...am female artist/academic/writer in my mid thirties.
...am somewhat nerdy and into books, going to galleries, NPR, and the nei=
ghborhood farmers market.
...spend most of my time at home writing, grading, or reading, so the apa=
rtment needs to be quiet.=20
...am an introvert; home is my sanctuary, so I really need for it to be a=
 place to recoup my energy.=20

You:
are...
...female
...financially stable, (i.e. able to pay rent and bills on time).=20
...over 25.=20
...pet-free.
...responsible, honest, communicative, friendly, and somewhat easy going.=

...preferring to spend your time at home doing mostly quiet activities, b=
ut are ok with some background noise (the neighborhood is lively).
...fairly tidy and willing to help with keeping the place clean.
...ok with a shoe-free household.
...wanting to stay for at least 1 year.

Bonus if:
you...
...have furniture, or are at least excited about helping me decorate.=20
...prefer to use minimally scented or eco-friendly cleaning and body prod=
ucts (I have a perfume allergy).

To move in:=20
Rent x 3 =3D First month + security deposit + last months rent=20

Utilities:=20
Heat/water is included. We pay for electricity and water.

About the building and area:
The building is a community with kind and attentive landlords on a tree-l=
ined street with everything nearby. This includes multiple laundry and gr=
ocery options, pharmacies, several banks, delis, etc. If you like organic=
 food, the highlights are the Flatbush Food Co-op and the farmers market =
on Cortelyou. There are also plenty of excellent restaurants and bars.
One of the best parts is that the neighborhood is lovely with lots of tre=
es, gardens, and large Victorian homes and is only around a 25 minute tra=
in ride from lower Manhattan with your choice of two express trains.

**Note: I have redecorated a little since these pictures were taken. The =
apartment will be re-photographed this weekend. Since my roommate just le=
t me know that she plans to get a new place with her boyfriend, I wanted =
to post the ad as soon as possible.

$1,100.00 Per Month, Clinton Hill/Bed Stuy, Brooklyn, Light-filled rooms =
in beautifully renovated prewar building
Available: Nov 01, 2014

2 light-flooded rooms available in a three bedroom, one bath apartment. T=
he building has just been renovated beautifully, so some original details=
 still remain but everything is very clean and nicely designed. There are=
 only 4 units in the building and each unit has their own floor. This uni=
t is the parlor level so the ceilings are high and the windows are big.

Both bedrooms are available November 1. One is available for 1100/month a=
nd the other is available for 1050/month. First, last, and security depos=
it required for move-in. Central AC, video intercom, hardwood floors, bat=
htub, exposed brick. Pets are okay as long as they are approved first!

I am currently pursuing my masters in architecture at Pratt (which is jus=
t a few blocks away) and previously worked at a modern art museum in the =
city for over 7 years. I am 31, responsible and respectful, but also like=
 to have friends over for dinner once in awhile. I cook clean, healthy fo=
od, and maintain a pretty healthy lifestyle in general. I am very clean a=
nd have a fairly minimal aesthetic, but like my home to be filled with pl=
ants, flowers, textiles, and art. I want this to feel like a safe home, a=
nd also think it has great possibilities to be a very beautiful one as we=
ll.

If interested, please let me know a bit about yourself!

Available: Nov 15, 2014 through Aug 31, 2015

Hey all,

One room is opening up in my 4-bedroom apartment at Driggs Ave and Graham=
 Ave in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, starting November 15, and you totally wanna=
 live in it. Here are the vitals:

What I&#39;m looking for in a new roommate:

-One person only. No couples (or triads or any other groups, lol). No ful=
l time students.=20

-You must intend to stay through August 2015 (when the lease is up) if ev=
erything works out well and be willing to sign a roommate agreement that =
covers expectations and responsibilities for living here (all reasonable =
stuff).

-No pets. Animals are allowed in the building and I love them, but I don&=
#39;t want any living in the apartment.

-Have your shit together. If you&#39;re broke, unemployed, have too littl=
e or no income or want to ask for a payment plan for the rent, or to not =
be super responsible and normal and reliable in any way, don&#39;t email =
me.

-Be able to pay rent for Nov 15-30, December, and security ($425 plus $95=
0 plus $950 =3D $2325) up front in order to secure your place in the apar=
tment, and $950 rent plus about $60 for utilities (internet, gas and elec=
tric) each month on the 25th of the month going forward (because I collec=
t each roommate&#39;s rent and then pay the whole rent to the landlord my=
self on the 1st since I&#39;m the only one on the lease).

-Be willing to not smoke anything in the apartment and not use, keep, buy=
 or sell recreational drugs in the apartment.

n space furniture, please. We&#39;re covered.

Door: Uh, yeah, you&#39;re a human being. There&#39;s a real door.

Floor: beautiful hardwood. &#39;cause you&#39;ve got good taste, baby!

Ceiling: there&#39;s one of those, too!

Is it a bullshit loft space that you can&#39;t stand up straight in? No.

Is there a built in lofted bed so you can live like an 11 year old in a b=
unk? No.

What it can fit: full or queen bed (depending on how much floor space you=
 want), small desk, chair, small chest of drawers, whatever you want. It&=
#39;s big enough to fit your life into fo&#39; sho&#39; if you have a rea=
sonable amount of stuff.

Closet: 1

Apartment info:

-4 bedrooms, 4 roommates (once the current one moves out, you&#39;d be th=
e new 4th), no pets currently

-1 bathroom. People are out a lot and it&#39;s never an issue.

-Windows to the outside in every room including the common space and bath=
room

-new kitchen appliances, everything in great condition and working order,=
 great bathroom, no mold or vermin/pest issues

-2nd floor walk up

-6-unit, 3-story, well-managed building with very nice landlord and neigh=
bors

-I am the only person on the lease, which started on Sept 1 and goes unti=
l Aug 31 of 2015, and everyone else in the apartment sublets their room f=
rom me.

-I love bright colors, patterns and cute, original things in home decor, =
and I plan to decorate the common space in the aesthetic of &quot;Pee-Wee=
&#39;s Playhouse with taste and style.&quot; I don&#39;t know exactly how=
 that&#39;s going to pan out yet, but the pics of the bathroom in this po=
st should give you a sense of what I like. It&#39;s going to be tasteful =
and something we can all be proud of, but it&#39;s going to be bright and=
 silly and fun, so if you like beige, tastelessness and clutter, this is =
not the place for you. Another thing that will let you know how I plan to=
 decorate is that the tea kettle I got for the apartment looks like a car=
toon elephant, complete with little tusks and a trunk for a handle. It br=
ings us all joy every day.

Roommate info:

Current roommates are one 30 yr old woman working in the arts and two 26 =
year old men working in TV production and tech. Everyone is nice, easygoi=
ng, friendly, considerate, clean, neat, nonsmoking, responsible, reliable=
, and generally great. We get along well and want to keep a friendly and =
considerate vibe in the apartment. Parties, social time and bringing gues=
ts over are all totally fine as long as we&#39;re all in communication ab=
out it and it doesn&#39;t bother anyone. I don&#39;t like it when people =
say &quot;don&#39;t bring the party home.&quot; Parties are for wherever =
parties need to be, and homes should be happy, chill places.

Neighborhood info:

Greenpoint is awesome and everybody loves it. Read some blog posts about =
it if you don&#39;t already know, but basically it has great food, bars, =
shopping, services, social life, McCarren park is right near the apartmen=
t, and we&#39;re a very short walk from prime Williamsburg. The Bedford L=
 stop is a 12 minute walk, and the Nassau G is a 5 minute walk, and the G=
 has gotten way better in recent years.

Looking forward to hearing from you!
JC

bedroom in 2br for 3-mo sublet
Available: Dec 01, 2014 through Feb 28, 2015

About the apartment: The apartment is a true, non-railroad 2-bedroom on t=
he third floor of a walkup in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, east of McGuinness Bl=
vd. It&#39;s become my cozy little haven from the noise and urgency of th=
e city. The living space is small but the bedrooms are relatively big. Th=
ere&#39;s a galley-style kitchen with lots of storage but no dishwasher. =
The living room fits a couch and coffee table. The room I&#39;m looking t=
o fill is 13x10 with hard-wood floors, a closet, and a storage cubby. It =
has two big windows that face the street. It can be furnished if necessar=
y. Every room in the apartment has at least one window and every room exc=
ept the bathroom has a ceiling fan.=20

About the neighborhood: The Nassau G is the nearest stop. The apartment i=

tance of tons of cafes and coffees shops.=20

About me: I&#39;m a 28-year-old journalist who&#39;s lived in NYC for six=
 years. I work a 8-7ish schedule during the week and am in and out during=
 the weekends. I like to run, practice yoga, cook, and grab dinner and dr=
inks with friends.

About you: I&#39;m looking for a female roommate who&#39;s relatively cle=
an and needs a cheap, comfortable place to call home for a few months.=20=


Rent does not include internet and electricity, which typically run about=
 $50-65/month. One month&#39;s security deposit is required. Sorry, my bu=
ilding does not allow pets.

Please message me and tell me a little about yourself. Happy hunting!=20

day. It&#39;s a peaceful abode, up in the treetops well above the William=
sburg bustle. Yes, it&#39;s a 5th floor walk up, but depending on how you=
 see it, it&#39;s either a drawback or, well, an opportunity to save cash=
 and cancel that gym membership for a few weeks.=20

The apartment building&#39;s on one of the most luscious streets of Willi=
amsburg, lined with trees and surrounded by little bars, restaurants, caf=
es, a number of supermarkets, laundromats, a corner deli, even a cinema -=
 all just a few minutes away. If you&#39;re more of a home body, there&#3=
9;s also a fully-equipped kitchen for all of your food-making needs.=20

The apartment&#39;s just off the Williamsburg bridge for eager bikers (Ci=
tibike stand on our corner), or bike storage space in the building. Subwa=
y options are also the best in Williamsburg, pretty much half-way between=
 the Bedford L (first stop in Brooklyn from Manhattan) and Lorimer L, and=
 Metropolitan G for getting around Brooklyn. The JMZ are just a few minut=
es further, easy for getting to JFK or expressing into town.

I&#39;ll be showing the apartment this Saturday, Nov 1 in the afternoon -=
 you&#39;ll have a chance to meet the room and the roomie. If this all so=
unds like a happy fit, feel free to email me, tell me a bit about yoursel=
f and float any questions you might have.

Thanks, and good luck!

$2,800.00 Per Month, Red Hook, Brooklyn, 1200 sq. ft., Luminous Open Loft=
 Space in Historical Factory Building
Available: Jan 06, 2015 through Oct 03, 2015

Open, 1200 sq.ft. loft space with 14&#39; ceilings and constant beautiful=
 light from seven 8ft tall windows with views of both  Manhattan and down=
town Brooklyn skylines. The building is located right on Coffey Park in t=
he center of Red Hook, just a couple blocks from Van Brunt St. and all ou=
r great bars, shops, restaurants and bus lines. The G an F subway lines a=
re a 15 min. walk into Carroll Gardens, or a shorter but more harrowing w=
alk across Hamilton Ave. to Smith &amp; 9th. There is also the Ferry Serv=
ice to Wall St. with stops at both the Ikea &amp; Fairway docks. Street p=
arking is fairly easy around the building if you have a car. Bicycles may=
 be parked in the courtyard.
Laundries are located on each of the four floors, as are garbage and recy=
cling stations. The loft has a full bathroom with a claw foot tub. there =
is a fully equipped kitchen t one end of the space with a large round din=
ing table and long wooden prep table. There is a Bose CD/mp3 player amp a=
nd DVD player, WiFi and AC. Heating is independent with thermostat. There=
 is a 6 ft x 42&quot; drawing table and a 14&#39; x 11&#39; working wall =
for large drawings.
This loft is organized for one person,( although couples have been happy =
here ), as there is no divided space, no roommate arrangements will be co=
nsidered. But there is really nothing like one great big room all to your=
self.
Also, whereas this is the perfect place to draw or work on small models, =
I am sorry that I cannot allow painting or sculpting or power tools.

$1,600.00 Per Month, Tompkinsville, Staten island, NY, 900 sq. ft., Light=
-filled loft-apartment
Available: Nov 01, 2014

Third floor of 1910 brick townhouse, open floor plan, twelve large window=
s on three sides, high ceilings, hardwood floors, ceiling fans, 10 minute=
 walk to ferry, large back yard which includes lot next door, good for en=
tertaining, relaxing,  and gardening, heat and hot water included. Live i=
n serene borough and get away from crowds in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Good=
 for visual artist. Last month, first month, and deposit required. Two ye=
ar lease with option to renew.=20

Tompkinsville, on the north shore of Staten Island, is changing rapidly. =
 There is a microbrewery with outside seating across the street.  There i=
s a dedicated art community with a surprising number of jazz  musicians.

We are two artists, Ron and Miriam.   Ron&#39;s studio is on the first fl=
oor.

This loft has housed many illustrious artists over the years.  Douglas Ko=
lk and Gary Simmons were young artists here. Terry Fox, the great video a=
rtist,
lived here with his family during the time he lived in New York in the 80=
&#39;s before moving back to Europe.  Cynthia Pannucci, Director of Art a=
nd Science Collaborations, ran her non-profit from this loft.=20

Miriam and I are owners of the building and the landlords. We live and wo=
rk on the first floor. We, (Ron or Miriam) will be showing the loft-apart=
ment. Proof of income as well as references from earlier landlords or oth=
er sources would be needed. There is no fee at this time for the space.

FYI, we have owned the building since 1980. The woman on the second floor=
 has lived there for 17 years. She was a dancer and now works physically =
helping other people with movement challenges. Our last tenant moved out =
of the third floor because she could no longer manage the stairs.=20

We would prefer someone who loves living there and can enjoy all that it =
has to offer for a considerable number of years. We have most enjoyed ren=
ting to creative people who can appreciate the opportunity to work in a s=
pace where they can concentrate. This apartment has housed single artists=
, couples, and, at one time, a couple with one small child.

Last year a new roof was installed, the building brick was pointed, and ,=
 and the cornice was rebuild and painted. A man down the street does most=
 of the repairs in the apartment when necessary.The building front area i=
s surrounded on three sides with a low iron fence and the yard is surroun=
ded by a high wood fence to insure privacy.

l throughout my travels if the tenant has any questions. My super lives 5=
 minutes away and is very nice in case there is an immediate question).

I dont need any documentation as the timeline is quite tight (I only hear=
d of the assignment a couple of days ago). But I would like to know that =
the potential tenant has no pets and is a non-smoker. It would also be gr=
eat to know where the potential tenant is from, her/his occupation and wh=
at she/he will be doing in New York.

The fees are: $ 1500 for the rent including all expenses. So, wifi, gas &=
amp; electricity is included to make this easier. I would ask for a $300 =
security deposit.

Also:- Please note that there is no television and no land line in the ap=
artment. The wifi is pretty fast though.

I would like to have a tenant who would need the apartment for a longer s=
pan of time. As it is a very personal space, I would not want to rent it =
out for one week and then have different tenants throughout the timeframe=
. So, a longterm tenant (1, 2 or 3 months...which would be best obviously=
) would be great.

The house is in Hudson, NY, two hours from NYC by Amtrak. A full descript=

-https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/3893476. In a nutshell, it&#39;s a lovely 3=

rip, Warren Street, filled with cafes, restaurants, antique shops, etc.=20=


We&#39;re thinking that, during the winter, it would be good to have some=
one rent the place for a few months as opposed to doing Airbnb. It&#39;s =
a great spot for a writer or an artist looking to complete a project outs=
ide of distraction of city. Happy to answer any questions about the place=
 or the area--even in the winter, it&#39;s a fun place to be.=20

Hi I&#39;m Jon. =20

I have a small company under my name, Jon Wye. We make awesome leather go=
ods with things like zombies and robots on them.  Everything we do is han=

s at Union Square and Grand Central Terminal. It&#39;s a busy season and =
we&#39;re looking for good people to help us.

We are hiring for November 19th to December 24th. Strong preference to th=
ose who can work the entire run and those willing to work more outdoors (=
extra incentives for outdoor positions). It&#39;s a lot of work but the b=
ase pay is good and there is commission!

Aside from being an awesome friendly sales person you would be required t=
o size and assemble some of the items customers will purchase.  It&#39;s =
very easy and makes the customer feel awesome! Don&#39;t worry we&#39;ll =
train you.=20

If you are an outgoing person, reliable (on-time and won&#39;t bail), not=
 flaky, need full time work during the holidays and are good with your ha=
nds (crafty stuff) shoot us at email at jonwye@jonwye.com and tell us a l=
ittle about yourself. =20

Incentives for the job are tied to an ability to be on-time, reliable, fr=
iendly, accurate in job execution and conversational with customers.  We =
have a tremendous customer service reputation and we want to keep that go=
ing.

<span> Stephanie, nice notes. I'll get into the dashboard and edit the po=

I sit, and has helped me find like minded and reliable tenants in the pas=

 that he didn't end up renting my place. Silver lining of sorts, to being=
 away from home and the rest of the mishegas in my life. So again, thank =
