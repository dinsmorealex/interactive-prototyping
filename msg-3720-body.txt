hey man,

anytime. I was happy that I could rearrange my plans and go and see him. He
looked so frightened when i was there. That was probably one of the hardest
things i've done so far in my life. He's dad seems very hopeful when I
talked to him and had it more together than I did, so that gives me a lot
of optimism.

I am off on my travels and Ill be starting school in London in the fall. I
am planning to come back to the US though, probably in early/mid September,
to stop in DC to pick up winter/none backpacking clothes. A side trip to NY
would certainly be in the cards there too.

how are you doing dude? what are you up to these days? do you still have
that gig with the fashion designer? are you still living with tom and dash?
hope all is well and tell your parents i say hello. also send me your
address and i'll send you a postcard.

stay in touch man - miss seeing you everyday,
-r
