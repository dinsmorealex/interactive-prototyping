Hello, 

We have several studies taking place next week. All
studies will be held in Manhattan, paying $85 via check. We are looking
for females and males 18 - 30 who own an iOS device and/or an Android
device. There are several time slots available, select the one that
works best for you.

 If you are interested in applying:  

* Visit
http://nyfocusgroups.com/projects [1] 

* Click "apply" next to the
group you are interested in. 

The survey you will be filling out is
just an eligibility survey and you will not be compensated for filling
it out. 

FAQ

I've been applying for studies, but I haven't been
picked. Why? 

It could be a number of reasons. Perhaps the study is
already full or you didn't meet all of the criteria we were looking for.
Don't be discouraged! You won't be accepted for every focus group. Keep
trying and you should get an opportunity! 

It could also be that, the
number you provided in you profile isn't working, or you didn't provide
a number for us to reach you. Please take the time to update your
profile, to ensure that you have provided a current phone number.


Thank you for your time and if you have any questions please feel free
to contact me.

Sincerely,
Victoria
