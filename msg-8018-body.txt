AM Cassandre

[7]Roland Garros
Nicholas (1998)(CB0603)
$175     [8]Purchase

The popularity of posters as advertising afforded A. M. Cassandre
(1901-1968) an opportunity to work for a Parisian printing house. Inspired
by cubism as well as surrealism, he earned a reputation with works such as
B=C3=BBcheron, a poster created for a cabinetmaker that won first prize at =
the
1925 Exposition Internationale des Arts D=C3=A9coratifs et Industriels Mode=
rnes.
His creations for the Dubonnet wine company were among the first posters
designed in a manner that allowed them to be seen by occupants in moving
vehicles. His posters are memorable for their innovative graphic solutions
and their frequent denotations to such painters as Max Ernst and Pablo
Picasso. In addition, he taught graphic design at the =C3=89cole des Arts
D=C3=A9coratifs and then at the =C3=89cole d'Art Graphique.

Vespa

[9]Skid Row
Vespa (1955)(CB0477)
$35     [10]Purchase

The Vespa came out of post-WWII era Italy, as a means of both
re-invigorating the almost dead automobile economy and providing cheap,
efficient means of transportation for the Italian populous. Though the
artist is unknown for this piece, there is a clear sense of style and grasp
of contrast. This poster is very clearly different from the more
photorealistic styles of the 1950s. This poster, with its sleek lines and
sense of style, captures the elegance of the vehicle as well as the
sihlouetted woman standing before it. It's clear to the observer that the
Vespa is not only a chic mode of transportation, but anybody who is anybody
should own one.

Picasso vs. Duchamp

[11]Recent Stillife
Picasso vs. Duchamp (CB0493)
$75 [12]Purchase

In one corner we have the Cubist Creator all the way from Spain, give it up
for Picasso! And in the other corner, A Daring Dadaist flying from France
to America, let's hear it for Duchamp! They are often regarded as the two
most influential artists of the 20th century; Picasso, who personified the
modernist painter, and Duchamp, the indifferent ironist and chess genius,
who challenged painting and transformed art into a maze of intellectual
amusements. Though Picasso spent much of that era bemoaning the rise of new
art gods, his special resentment for Duchamp was drawn on philosophical
lines. Ever the stylist, Picasso loved the visual arts so much he famously
wished for an existence sans brains, powered by "only our eyes." On the
other end was the cerebral Duchamp, whose unabashed factory line philosophy
for art-making, and preference for riddles, attacked the very foundation of
the field. Duchamp tellingly left the art world to devote his life to
chess. This poster comes from an exhibition from the Modern Museet, pitting
the two artists head to head posthumously.

Magritte

[13]Skid Row
L'Heureux Donateur (1966)(CB0501)
$30     [14]Purchase

Magritte's style of surrealism is more representational than the
"automatic" style of artists such as Joan Mir=C3=B3. Magritte's use of ordi=
nary
objects in unfamiliar spaces is joined to his desire to create poetic
imagery. He described the act of painting as the art of putting colors side
by side in such a way that their real aspect is effaced, so that familiar
objects; the sky, people, trees, mountains, furniture, the stars, solid
structures, graffiti, become united in a single poetically disciplined
image. The poetry of this image dispenses with any symbolic significance,
old or new.

Ren=C3=A9 Magritte described his paintings as "visible images which conceal
nothing; they evoke mystery and, indeed, when one sees one of my pictures,
one asks oneself this simple question, 'What does that mean?'. It does not
mean anything, because mystery means nothing either, it is unknowable."

              In one corner we have the Cubist Creator all the way from Spa=
in, give it up for <b>Picasso</b>! And in the other corner, A Daring Dadais=
t flying from France to America, let's hear it for <b>Duchamp</b>! They are=
 often regarded as the two most influential artists of the 20th century; Pi=
casso, who personified the modernist painter, and Duchamp, the indifferent =
ironist and chess genius, who challenged painting and transformed art into =
a maze of intellectual amusements. Though Picasso spent much of that era be=
moaning the rise of new art gods, his special resentment for Duchamp was dr=
awn on philosophical lines. Ever the stylist, Picasso loved the visual arts=
 so much he famously wished for an existence sans brains, powered by "only =
our eyes." On the other end was the cerebral Duchamp, whose unabashed facto=
ry line philosophy for art-making, and preference for riddles, attacked the=
 very foundation of the field. Duchamp tellingly left the art world to devo=
te his life to chess. This poster comes from an exhibition from the Modern =
Museet, pitting the two artists head to head posthumously.</p>

              <b>Magritte's</b> style of surrealism is more representationa=
l than the "automatic" style of artists such as Joan Mir=C3=B3. Magritte's =
use of ordinary objects in unfamiliar spaces is joined to his desire to cre=
ate poetic imagery. He described the act of painting as the art of putting =
colors side by side in such a way that their real aspect is effaced, so tha=
t familiar objects; the sky, people, trees, mountains, furniture, the stars=
, solid structures, graffiti, become united in a single poetically discipli=
ned image. The poetry of this image dispenses with any symbolic significanc=
e, old or new.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              Ren=C3=A9 Magritte described his paintings as "visible images=
 which conceal nothing; they evoke mystery and, indeed, when one sees one o=
f my pictures, one asks oneself this simple question, 'What does that mean?=
'. It does not mean anything, because mystery means nothing either, it is u=
nknowable." <span style=3D"text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>=
