Hello, List!

Listings Project Story of the Week:

I love Listings Project. It's how I found my studio in the first place. A=
nd I'm 99% sure that the people I deal with are for the most part going t=
o be decent and community minded. It's really made finding accommodation =
and studio space in NYC a lot more pleasant! All the best, Ben


Best,
Stephanie
