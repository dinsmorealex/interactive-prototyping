$525.00 Per Month, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, 200 sq. ft., Charming office/stu=
dio available in prime Greenpoint  (includes utilities)
Available: Apr 01, 2015 through Apr 01, 2016

A semi-private space is available April 1st (or sooner, currently vacant)=
 for sublease in my studio, approximately 200 square feet for $525, utili=
ties included (heat &amp; electricity). The ceilings are 11 feet high, so=
 it feels larger. The entire 600 sq foot studio is shared with two other =
people - my space is in the back and completely private with a door, whil=
e your space is in the middle, divided from the other studio with a parti=
al wall, which goes all the way up to the ceiling. There are no windows, =
but abundant wall space and a small storage loft. Perfect for a painter. =
=20

The charming space has one exposed brick wall, and original details of wo=
od ceiling, beams and floor. It feels very comfortable and homey in there=
, great place to work. The photos feature my previous studiomates&#39; st=
uff, but it&#39;s best to take a look at it in person and see how you wou=
ld set it up yourself.

There is a freight elevator, mailbox, slop sink, clean bathrooms, and 24-=
hour access to building. Many artists and creative professionals in the b=
uilding.

Amazing, prime location, just 2 blocks from the G at Greenpoint Ave and w=
alking distance to tons of great bars, shops, and restaurants.

I prefer someone with a quiet practice - no woodworking (occasional is ok=
), loud machines, or toxic materials. I require first month&#39;s rent pl=
us 2 months security deposit. The lease is for one year, but if you need =
to leave before then, you can give me 45 days notice.=20

$595.00 Per Month, Long Island City, Queens, New York City, 300 sq. ft., =
Bright, Shared but Private Artist Studio
Available: Mar 11, 2015

Your space is 10&#39;x30&#39; with a huge bank of windows on the second f=
loor with a view of trees out the windows. Rent includes everything (elec=
tricity, heat and garbage pick-up).  I use fans but have an AC if needed.=
 The ceiling is 13&#39; high, racks and storage are already built-out, we=
ll-heated, 24/7 access, freight elevator, parking space extra.  It&#39;s =
a professionally run, safe building of artist and small businesses.  The =
lease expires in September but I (we?) will probably renew the space beca=
use it&#39;s a good price for the neighborhood.  Old bodegas, new restaur=
ants and a grocery store are close by, it a mixed neighborhood and great =
the more you get to know it. I&#39;m a painter/muralist (oil and water ba=
sed paints), NPR is usually on but I&#39;m open to other ideas.  A gauzy =
curtain divides the space so it feel quite private, I don&#39;t work too =
late although many in the building do work evenings.  Easy going, shared =
frig, across the hall from sinks and bathrooms.  I ride my bike daily and=
 park inside the fenced parking lot.

	The studio is in the BFP building, which has a caf, bar, restaurant and =
event space right below the building.=20

1420 and your share will be apportioned based on the space you are taking=
. It is all at face value and I am not interested in profits.

hat case you will have the place to yourself 99% of the time, as I will b=
e using it primarily for storage only.=20

se. If you need to leave before then, please give me 30 days notice.

$1,350.00 Per Month, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, NY, Bodacious Pad at the Cent=

Available: Apr 01, 2015

Deets:
Rent- $1, 350
Security- $1, 350
Utilities- Approx $100 a month for internet, gas and electric
Move-in date- April 1st

I&#39;ve got this awesome apartment. Sure, it has it&#39;s quirks (welcom=
e to New York everybody!), but it is spacious with good storage and a gaz=
illion neighborhood amenities. Fort Greene and Prospect Parks, the Barcla=
ys Center, at least seven major thoroughfares within five blocks...
oh yeah, and a great room mate!

About me: I love civic duty, American football, paintings with boats in t=
hem, and unwinding at the end of the day either taking walks/runs, eating=
 tasty food in a restaurant or watching something on TV. In other words, =
my life is really really simple. No drama, good sense of humor, and not m=
elodramatic or passive aggressive.

About you: Do your thing, so long as you don&#39;t bring your thing home =
in a way that is seedy or ostentatious. I keep the place tidy, so be tidy=
, but you don&#39;t have to be OCD. Be able to commit to a year at least.=
 No boyfriends or girlfriends kinda sorta living with you. No pets. We do=
n&#39;t need to be best buds, just live together in harmony and not leave=
 sticky notes for each other on the bathroom mirror.

All of the common spaces are fully furnished, and your bedroom (picture w=
ith the stripey wall) comes with the yellow dresser and a floor lamp.

Interested? Curious? Easily amused? Email me!

**Every now and again, my friend&#39;s dog Jesse spends the weekend. She =
is a total sweetheart, but if you have an allergy, just thought you shoul=
d know.

Hey there!  We have a huge, beautiful room on the second floor of a 4-sto=
ry brownstone in South Park Slope.  The room is about 450 sq. ft, 16 ft. =
ceilings, original hardwood floors and moldings, large windows, tons of l=
ight.  The first floor is common space, including the shared kitchen and =
bathroom, projector and impressive VHS collection.  Basement houses the w=
asher+dryer and also serves as a practice/performance space.  The backyar=
d is gorgeous, even covered in snow, with a grill, herb/veggie garden and=
 hammock! =20

To be clear, the room is private, but every other part of the house is sh=
ared.  There are 7 of us total.  We are looking to transition the house i=
nto more of an arts space, with regular events (live music, readings, scr=
eenings, etc.), as several of us already use it to rehearse and create.  =
It would be amazing to find a new housemate who is interested in contribu=
ting to the effort, whether with their own work or support and enthusiasm=
! =20

We are just a couple blocks away from the F, R and G trains at 4th ave/9t=
h st., 15 min. to Lower Manhattan.  Also a short walk to Prospect Park, t=
ons of awesome bars, restaurants, grocery stores, great pizza and 7-11, f=
or when you really need a slurpee.

Rent is $1250/month + $50 for utilities (gas/electric/wi-fi) and is avail=
able for move-in between March 15-April 1.  Would be looking to sign a le=
ase thru August 31st, with option to sign for another full year.  The lan=
dlords are great, and super supportive of the artistic endeavors of the h=
ouse.  It really is an awesome house filled with interesting, creative pe=
ople, so come check it out!

$1,200.00 Per Month, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Big bedroom available for re=
nt in a two-bedroom apartment with a roommate who travels frequently
Available: Mar 15, 2015

I&#39;m looking for a roommate to take the big, front, more private bedro=
om in my two-bedroom railroad apartment in Williamsburg. This room has a =
decent-size closet and its own entrance from the building hallway, which =
helps with privacy, and looks out on a quiet residential street. The kitc=
hen, at the other end of the apartment, is large and gets great southern =
life.=20
The apartment is three blocks from the subway and one block from a grocer=
y store and laundry. The neighborhood is full of cafes, restaurants and b=
ars.
I&#39;m a responsible, considerate, clean roommate. I support myself as a=
 freelance travel writer, which means I&#39;m often away and my roommate =
has the place to herself. Some days I work at home, but more often I spen=
d my days in New York outside the apartment.

$1,250.00 Per Month, Park Slope, Brooklyn, Stellar Park Slope Apartment (=
with cheffy roommate who will feed you)
Available: Mar 15, 2015

Do you dislike being within easy walking distance of restaurants, stores =
and trains? Do you hate peaceful tree-lined streets and being near large =
parks? If so, you should probably close this tab right now. If not, you s=
hould read on!

I&#39;m looking for a roommate starting April 1st or March 15th to share =
a 2-bedroom apartment in prime Park Slope (7th St, half a block from Pros=
pect Park). I&#39;ve been in this apartment for 1.5 years now, and love t=
he space and neighborhood. The two rooms are the same shape and NYC-sized=
 (about 10&#39;x15). However, the kitchen and living room are combined as=
 one big space, which gives us a lot of flexibility. For instance, I&#39;=
ve been using one of the walls as a projection screen for movie nights. T=
he kitchen has nice stainless steel appliances, plenty of cabinet space (=
you&#39;ll get half of the shelves), and a dishwasher.

There is laundry in the building&#39;s basement, and you can store a bike=
 downstairs. The apartment is on the 2nd floor, the 1st floor is occupied=
 by an elderly lady (who has never complained about noise), and the tenan=
ts on the 3rd/4th floors are young professionals and dog owners. The 7th =
Ave F/G stop is 2 blocks away, the commercial corridors of 7th Ave and 9t=
h St are nearby, and Brooklyn&#39;s greatest front lawn/running track/peo=
ple watching area/concert grounds aka Prospect Park is right down the str=
eet.

The monthly rent is $1250 per person plus utilities (about $50/month for =
internet, gas and electricity). One month rent and security deposit to mo=
ve in, no other fees. I have verified that the landlord is human, respond=
s quickly to texts and has a good sense of humor. You&#39;ll be on the le=
ase officially.

About me: I work full-time in seafood distribution in Brooklyn. Prior to =
this, I worked on an indie documentary about sustainable food. I&#39;ve b=
een in lots of shared housing situations before, including a year in Ital=
y with international roommates. I cook frequently, make excellent pizza, =
bike year-round and take a proactive, DIY approach to life.

Thanks for reading, I hope to get in touch with you soon!=20

$900.00 Per Month, Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, Great 1 BR Available in 3 BR/2Bath=
 Apt in Bed-Stuy near G train!
Available: Mar 21, 2015

Two super cool girls looking for a third female roommate (preferably with=
 no pets) in Brooklyn to move in on March 21st (or April 1st) and stay fo=
r a minimum of 1 year or more.=20

Greetings and salutations!

Our roommate is moving out and we&#39;re looking for someone to move into=
 the third bedroom in our apartment in Brooklyn. Move in date would be Ma=
rch 21st so we&#39;re looking for someone who could move in pretty quickl=
y. If you need to move before the 21st, that could also be arranged (coul=
d even be as early as the 16th). The rent is $900 a month, plus utilities=
 and internet. Upon move in, there is a $900 security deposit and the lea=
se would be for a minimum of 1 year. If moving in April 1st, it will be p=
rorated to $450 + 900 deposit for move in.

Our rent is due on the 15th of each month.

Here are the details:

The place: The apartment is newly renovated and really wonderful (we&#39;=
ve been here for about 2 years and we love it) with a lot of natural ligh=
t, exposed brick, central air, and shiny brand new appliances (including =
a dishwasher!). It&#39;s located right near the corner of Lafayette and B=
edford on the third floor of a 3 floor building. Everyone who lives here =
is nice and the building is very quiet, which is great to come home to af=
ter a long day at work.

The room itself is a decent size (can fit a full sized bed and a dresser)=
, has a really large closet, access to the fire escape, and lots of stora=
ge space. Exposed brick on half of the walls and gets lots of light.=20
=20
There&#39;s a lot of cool restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and eateries w=
ithin walking distance. A grocery store and a laundromat are also only a =
few blocks away. The Bedford Nostrand G stop is right outside, along with=
 the B38 bus, and the A/C train is just a short trek away.

Us: We&#39;re two girls in our twenties who love Twin Peaks (Cooooop), Bi=
ll Murray, and Bruce Campbell. We&#39;re fairly quiet, easy going, and ke=
ep to ourselves -- although we also enjoy hanging out in the living room =
together as well. One of us works with books in publishing and spends her=
 spare time kicking ass and taking names playing roller derby. The other =
works in music licensing, is getting her graduate degree at the new schoo=
l, is a big fan of Prince, and has to watch &#39;boogie nights&#39; at le=
ast once a week (at least).

You: We&#39;re looking for a girl mid to late 20&#39;s (sorry fellas) who=
&#39;s laid back, with her own schedule, a steady income, good credit, an=
d who doesn&#39;t mind sharing a bathroom with one of us. Preferably some=
one who doesn&#39;t smoke or do drugs or party too hard. Of course you&#3=
9;d be able to have people over and we&#39;re all for small gatherings bu=
t like we said earlier, it&#39;s a quiet building so nothing too rowdy, p=
lease. The living room and kitchen are shared spaces so we try our best t=
o keep it clean and tidy-- it would be cool if you could do the same too!=

=20
If you&#39;re interested or you have any questions, shoot us an email wit=
h &quot;Howdy Friends!&quot; in the subject line so we know you read thro=
ugh. We can set up a time for you to come meet us and see the room/apartm=
ent. =20

$1,650.00 Per Month, Crown Heights, Brooklyn, 347 sq. ft., Master Bedroom=
 In Gorgeous and Homey Three-Story Brownstone
Available: Mar 01, 2015 through Oct 01, 2015

Hi,=20

It is with real regret that I must let go of this room and greater home. =
Words and pictures truly do not do this unique space justice; it is witho=
ut a doubt the highest quality living experience I&#39;ve had in the City=
. I can&#39;t count the number a times I&#39;ve been asked, &quot;You act=
ually live here?&quot;=20

I&#39;ll begin with the room. It&#39;s enormous, measuring at 19ft x 17ft=
. There is also a closet area that is 8ft x 3ft, bringing the total to 34=
7sqft. It feels like a studio apartment and easily holds a bed, a desk (I=
 work from home), and a couch / living room area, with plenty of empty sp=
ace left over. There are three large windows that let in tons of sunlight=
 throughout the day and three closets. One wall is completely lined with =
shelves for an extraordinary amount of storage and decorating space. Addi=
tionally, I will be looking to sell my bed and all of my furniture if you=
 would like the room furnished at a discount. =20

Now for the house. It&#39;s a gorgeous brownstone with parquet hardwood f=
loors, intricate molding, a decorative fireplace and tons of additional t=
ouches that give it indescribable character. Architecturally, they don&#3=
9;t make many apartments like this in NYC anymore. There are three storie=
s connected by a beautiful spiraling wooden staircase. A huge plus is tha=
t all of the common areas are located on the first floor so noise is neve=
r an issue. These include a sunroom / parlor, a sizable living room / mov=
ie room, a gigantic dining room (with an indoor bike rack) and a kitchen.=
 But my favorite part is the backyard. During the warmer months, nothing =
beats gardening in our three raised vegetable beds, grilling &amp; eating=
 on the outside table, and playing cornhole on our homemade set. Oh and t=
here&#39;s also a laundry room with a washer and dryer, too!

There are a total of five bedrooms rooms (including the master) and one g=
uest room; two on the second story and three on the third story. The mast=
er bedroom is on the second story. Each story has a bathroom (two total),=
 so you will be sharing a bathroom with just one other person. Her name i=
s Ope and she&#39;s really great. Very chill with an infectious laugh. I&=
#39;m the only one who&#39;s home on a regular basis due to my work and m=
ost of the time the house is empty. Even on weeknights and weekends, ther=
e&#39;s rarely ever more than two roommates at a time in common areas. Ev=
eryone is a mid-to-late 20-something working professional (elementary tea=
cher, clothing designer, comedy writer, &amp; landscaper) who tends to be=
 out and about. When home, everyone is extremely respectful of everyone e=
lse&#39;s space and time. It usually stays pretty low-key though dinners =
are hosted, movies are watched and fun is had.

The building supervisor is also really great. He makes our life a lot eas=
ier. Anytime an issue arises, he&#39;s on it within 24 hours. He lives do=
wnstairs but we never see him unless we call.=20

The apartment is located in Crown Heights, about a block and a half from =
Franklin (at St. Marks Ave and Rogers). We are close to grocery stores, r=
estaurants, bars, coffee shops, bike shops, yoga gyms and tons of other r=
esources. Brooklyn Public Library, Grand Army Plaza Farmer&#39;s Market, =
and Prospect Park are a pleasant 1.2 mile walk from the house. There&#39;=
s also quick access to the following trains: A, C, 2, 3, 4, 5, Shuttle, a=
nd lirr.=20

Our lease began on October 1st of last year. You will replace my girlfrie=
nd and I on it. Everyone in the house will sign a new contract expiring o=
n October 1st of this year. You will then have the option of renewing the=
 lease for a full year. You get to avoid the painful broker&#39;s fee, bu=
t will be expected to provide last month&#39;s rent and a security deposi=
t.=20

Who you are: an individual or couple preferably in your 20s or early 30s.=
 Everyone in the house is respectful, kind, and no-drama. We&#39;re looki=
ng for someone with a similar demeanor. Though not everyone knew each oth=
er before living together, everyone gets along. It&#39;s not unusual to j=
oin in on another roommate&#39;s BBQ, board game or watching NBA. It&#39;=
s a very warm and comfortable home and that&#39;s highly valued by everyo=
ne. So the right fit will not only be financially credible (you will be a=
sked to submit the typical documentation proving your credibility) but al=
so have generally good vibes.=20

The room is available March 1st though I can be flexible with your move-i=
n date. I will only respond to serious inquiries. No pets unfortunately. =
If you have any questions at all, please feel free to reach out. Thanks a=
 ton and I look forward to meeting you!=20

Best,
Nick

 Large, Private Bedrooms Available in Huge, New Loft-Share, Creative &amp=
; Fun Vibe!

We have 4 unfurnished bedrooms available in a large loft-share made up of=
 multiple bedrooms. 2 bedrooms are available for Mar 1st move-in or mid-m=
onth (dates flexible). There are also 2 rooms for Apr 1st move-in availab=
le. Each room is $950-1075, about 140-160sf.=20

Each room is single occupancy, no sharing. The rooms feature baseboard he=
at, hardwood floors, high ceilings, and beautiful, outside windows. One o=
f the rooms had a large upper loft area added that can fit a bed or more,=
 creating 2 levels.=20

We are the loft designers and managers with a long-term lease on the floo=
r, who sublet individual spaces. If there is a maintenance issue, we&#39;=
re on it. If you want custom shelving or a custom room loft (for a bed/st=
orage), we can build it for you at a reasonable rate. Or feel free to DiY=
.=20

The loft is the whole first floor of a converted warehouse, and is a new,=
 high-quality buildout with 11 1/2 ft. ceilings throughout; a double kitc=
hen with new appliances (2 stoves/ovens, 2 fridges/freezers, 2 sinks), di=
shwasher, aluminum counters; 2 large, full bathrooms with Roman tile and =
glass showers, plus a 1/2 bathroom with laundry room. There is also a lar=
ge common area with tables and couches, plus rooftop access, and free WiF=
i.=20

Fellow loft-mates are responsible and creative professionals and students=
, mostly people in their 20s, though some are older. We accept people of =
all types and ages, though pets are somewhat discouraged (case by case ba=
sis). We are looking for an eager and compatible roommate for those alrea=
dy living in the loft. The other 3 floors of the building are made up of =
similar lofts with many artists and musicians, some who&#39;ve been livin=
g in the building for a while. This is a chill living space not a party s=
pot.

The loft is located in heart of NYC&#39;s most exciting neighborhood: Bus=
hwick. The coolest community and best neighborhood for everything! Shops =
at the Loom, coffee shops, yoga, hip restaurants, bars, music, galleries,=
 DIY spaces... Quick L train ride to Manhattan and an ideal location in B=
rooklyn.=20

We are asking for a minimum 6 month commitment with first, last and depos=
it upfront, up to 1-yr lease. Utilities and the weekly cleaning service a=
re extra, but are equally shared and reasonably priced (about $50/month o=
n average). Email or text if you&#39;d like more info or want to schedule=
 a viewing.

t in Great Pre-War Apartment Seconds from Prospect Park
Available: Apr 01, 2015 through Aug 31, 2016

I am looking for a friendly, responsible, and cleanly flatmate to rent a =
lovely room in my spacious 2-bedroom apartment in Windsor Terrace, Brookl=
yn. The apartment is in a very well maintained pre-war building just a fe=
w steps from Prospect Park. Easy and safe subway and bus connections (1 b=

nt storage space. You are also welcome to keep coats in the front hall cl=

The remainder of the apartment is fully furnished.=20

I&#39;d like to find a flatmate who is thoughtful, easy-going, and a good=
 communicator. You should also be steadily employed and preferably work a=
way from home by and large. I have lived here for 9.5 years and I am pret=
ty settled in, but I&#39;m happy to share my home. I&#39;d like a roommat=

gether and helping with periodic cleaning of common spaces. I will ask yo=

About Me:

I&#39;m 35 yrs old (female) and I work as Director of community organizin=
g and social justice programs for a non-profit in Manhattan. I am social =
and thoughtful. I am a bit artistic though I tend to lean towards &quot;f=
unctional&quot; art and crafts, carpentry, etc. I like to go hiking and a=
lso enjoy cooking but tend to forage in the fridge when it is just me com=
ing home late from work which happens often. On a typical weeknight, if I=
 am getting home anytime after 8pm, I tend to crash on the couch with a g=
ood book or watch TV, if I haven&#39;t made plans to hang out with friend=
s. On a particularly energetic day, I might wake up and go for a walk/run=
 in the park before work and on others I hit the snooze on my alarm clock=
 several times before I can drag myself to a shower. Aside from an occasi=
onal back log of laundry in my own room, and once in a while a couple of =
rinsed dishes in the sink, I like to keep the apartment very clean and or=
derly for a bit of calm. I expect my flatmate to contribute to maintainin=
g this peaceful and airy vibe.

My Home&#39;s Features:

Well maintained pre-war elevator apartment building with great charm. Red=
 brick building, terrazzo floors in halls and lobby.
Well equipped eat-in-kitchen, with plenty of cabinet space, though best s=
uited for a tall person, which I am not...
Large living room with ample seating and space to relax after a long day.=
=20
Original hardwood floors throughout and many windows.
Clean space and clutter free.
Pay per load washers/dryers available in basement.
Sorry, no pets allowed.
No cigarette smokers.
Please do not email me if you are a couple seeking housing together... I =
am looking for one roommate only.

I had posted in February but my roommate ended up staying an extra month.=
 So, I am searching for someone for April 1 at this time.

If you are interested please send me a note with information about yourse=
lf like I have included here. (This is essential!) Please allow me a day =
or so to respond.=20

A bit about me.  I&#39;m a 24 year old recent Brooklyn transplant.  I wor=
k weekdays pretty much 830-6 for a beverage startup here in Brooklyn as w=
ell.  I like to cook, and generally just lay low at home during the week.=
  Go out on the weekends a bit and am not opposed to having a few people =
over now and again as long as it&#39;s low key.  Really just want to find=
 someone who will treat the place with respect and understands how to sha=
re a living space.

The space is empty in the photos because I just moved in.

$975.00 Per Month, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Bedroom available in 2 bdroom =
apt in Williamsburg Bk. Overlooking Devoe Street!
Available: Apr 01, 2015 through Apr 01, 2016

Bedroom available in a two bedroom apartment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn st=
eps from the Lorimer (L)/Metropolitan (G) stop beginning April 1st for $9=
75/month. It&#39;s literally a few steps from the 24 hour Bagelsmith.

I&#39;m a middle school teacher with crazy work hours (6am-630pm) so you =
would have quiet mornings. I am a female in my early 30&#39;s and would p=
refer a young professional with similar work hours. There is a beautiful =
communal living room with access to a 42&#39; flat screen with most any s=
treaming device imaginable. The kitchen is spacious and there are great w=
indows that cross from the living room to the kitchen and provides amazin=
g cross breeze and light! I&#39;m addicted to carbonated water and cookin=
g so there are great kitchen amenities. Desired roommate must not have a =
pet because I already have an amazingly friendly cat!

The apartment is on the third floor of the building overlooking Devoe Str=
eet. The bedroom has a window also overlooking Devoe Street and a double =
rowed deep closet. There are two bathroom cabinets, so you would have you=
r own bathroom space. Roommate must pass a credit &amp; background check =
and be willing to sign a year lease. Utilities are not included.=20

I&#39;ll be hosting an open house this Wednesday, March 11th, from 715-81=
5P. Email for additional information. Hope to see you there!

$1,720.00 Per Month, East Village/Alphabet City, NYC, 190 sq. ft., Large,=
 sunny room in East Village townhouse
Available: Apr 01, 2015 through Sept 01, 2015

Roomy bedroom available in two-story townhouse with own entrance - condo =
has three bedrooms and two full baths. The available room is on the secon=
d floor of the apartment (third floor of building), with two windows and =
a built-in closet. It shares the floor with the other bedroom, laundry ro=
om and bath (with full tub).

The room is 11.9 by 16 (almost 200 square feet!), faces 11th street and g=
ets sun throughout the day and, due to position on the 3rd floor, street =
noise is minimized. As well as the five-foot wide closet with shelving wi=
thin the room, there is additional storage available in a closet on the f=
loor.

The end date is flexible.

The room is partially furnished but can be empty if desired. The room is =
for a single person, and not a couple, please.

The apartment has washer/dryer and dishwasher with hardwood floors throug=
hout and individually-controlled heat and A/C. Second floor of apartment =
has a great skylight. The first floor is fully furnished. Kitchen is well=
 equipped, with a central island and open floor plan to the living room, =
as well as to the occupied bedroom and second bath.

The two current housemates are busy, out a lot and quiet when at home. Oc=
casional hangouts in the kitchen are friendly and social, but usually whe=
n home, folks are working/hanging out in their rooms, so the atmosphere i=
s calm.

The neighborhood is terrific. Five minutes one direction takes you to the=
 bucolic East River walk and every other direction takes you to cafes, re=
staurants, shops and bars or Tompkins Square Park. Easy walk to 1st Ave L=
, a few minutes more to Union Square (passing Traders Joe&#39;s on the wa=
y), and busses on the avenues (express bus at 1st Ave.)

The house is clean, well maintained and breezy, and feels like a home. Th=
ere is a quiet, shy cat who lives in the apartment and we are not looking=
 for more pets.

Thanks and good luck.

$825.00 Per Month, Bed Stuy, Brooklyn, Room available in Sunny Two-Bedroo=
m Apt
Available: Apr 01, 2015

My roommate is moving in with her BFF, and so I am looking for a new pers=
on to share my two-bedroom apartment.

The available room is 10x10 with a closet and a large window facing the b=
ackyards of the block. It has original parquet floors and a ceiling fan, =
which is great for keeping the space cool even when summer rolls around.

The apartment is cozy and pretty fully stocked. The living room has a gre=
at couch for curling up and reading a book. There is a bluetooth enabled =
stereo system with a nice set of speakers. It also has a wall of bookshel=
ves, so feel free to add your books to the library!

The kitchen is large with new appliances and plenty of storage space. I h=
ave a full set of cookware, dishes, utensils, and glasses.=20

There is roof access and the landlord is great. The apartment is located =
on the second floor of a small two story building. There is laundry a sho=
rt walk from the apartment and a cute local/organic grocer 2 blocks away.=
 A bar and cafe recently opened down the street, so there are places to h=
ang out if you don&#39;t feel like leaving the neighborhood. There is als=
o a bodega at the end of the block for beer and other necessities.

The apartment is a five minute walk from the Utica A/C express stop. You =
can also hop on the B46 to head up to Williamsburg or walk over to the Ga=
tes J (12 min walk) to get to the Lower East Side.

I am 28 years old and work in cultural affairs and philanthropy. I am loo=
king for someone else who has a full time job or does most of their work =
away from the apartment. I often work long hours and tend to socialize aw=
ay from the apartment. I am looking for someone else who is quiet and nic=
e so that our home can be a relaxing environment.

To move in, you&#39;ll need first month&#39;s rent and a one-month securi=
ty deposit. Utilities tend to run about $50-60 a month per person. Lgbtq =
friendly. Veg preferred, but it doesn&#39;t really matter. No pets. If yo=
u&#39;re interested, please get in touch.

$900.00 Per Month, East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Furnished, cute and cozy =
bedroom in 2BR apartment
Available: Apr 01, 2015

Im looking for a roommate (preferably female) to live in 1 furnished bedr=
oom in a 2 bedroom/1 bathroom apartment. Rent per month is $825 plus util=
ities $75 (internet, gas, electricity). The apartment is 1/2 a block from=
 the Montrose stop on the L. There&#39;s a 24 hour grocery store one bloc=
k away. Laundry is also one block away (and they do drop-off service). Th=
ere are several great bars, restaurants, and shops in the area.

The room is already furnished with a twin size futon bed and a couple of =
other shelving/drawer pieces. The room is long and narrow (it&#39;s about=
 15&#39; x 5&#39;) but it is quite cozy and thankfully there are very hig=
h ceilings. There is a big closet in the bedroom and there is a window th=
at opens to the inside of the apartment towards the kitchen. The AC is in=
 the kitchen, so that does well to cool the bedroom. There is a tiny livi=
ng room between the two bedrooms with a sleeper sofa and a large flat scr=
een tv.

A little bit about me: I am 29 yr old female that manages an art gallery =
during the day and paints weeknights/weekends at my art studio. If I am n=
ot at work or in my studio, then I am out at art openings, with friends, =
etc. so I am not home that much. On occasion, I like having a couple of f=
riends over, and I would be happy for you to have you friends over, too! =
When I am home, I&#39;m pretty quiet because I am usually home to just sl=
eep these days, and I really like to keep things neat and clean. I don&#3=
9;t have any pets, and I don&#39;t smoke so I prefer to keep it that way =
inside the apartment.

Please say a bit about yourself and how long you would plan on staying. O=
ne months rent plus one months security required to stay.

$1,250.00 Per Month, Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, 150 sq. ft., Lovely, lig=
ht-filled, charming rm in great nabe--F only
Available: Apr 01, 2015

Hi there! My current roommate is leaving to be closer to Columbia, so I h=
ave a wonderful bedroom available in my 2br in Prospect Heights for a mat=
ure, clean, easygoing female who works full time outside the apartment. T=
he apartment is on the 2nd floor of a 3 story row house. Bedroom is gorge=
ous and large (about 12 x 14), with 2 windows overlooking back gardens. Y=
ou can easily fit a double/queen bed, desk/worktable, dresser, nightstand=
, bookshelves, etc. Decent-sized closet! It&#39;s north facing so stays q=
uite cool in the summer. (When it was my room I had an A/C window unit bu=
t really, a large fan is sufficient.)

The rest of the apartment consists of living room full of vintage Danish/=
mid-century furniture, cute bathroom with tub/shower, and separate eat-in=
 kitchen with plenty of counter space and cabinets. Great if you love to =
cook!=20

About me: I teach  part-time at Pratt and work as a copy editor for sever=
al well-known book publishers. My schedule tends to change, and I do spen=
d a considerable amount of time working from home. So (as mentioned earli=
er) I strongly prefer that you have a regular, full-time day job. I am in=
 my 40s, clean, sane, responsible, outgoing, friendly, and funny...but en=
joy my space and quiet time and will respect your need for the same. Plea=
se note: I strongly prefer to live with someone over 30. (No offense if y=
ou&#39;re in your 20s...I have tons of younger friends, just don&#39;t wa=
nt to live with any of them.) :)

I have a fat, sweet, adorable cat named Cecil, but he needs to be an only=
 cat, so ideally you like cats but don&#39;t have one yourself. I&#39;m n=
ot really a neat freak, but do keep the place clean, especially the kitch=
en and bathroom. If you are looking for a comfy, cozy, warm and pleasant =
home, this is your place.=20

The room is unfurnished, so you will have to provide your own. Heat is in=
cluded. Remaining bills (including wi-fi) generally total around $100-120=
 per month each. What else? This is a fantastic neighborhood -- the best =
part of P-Heights. Tree-lined, pretty, safe, and convenient to everything=
. 5 minute walk to 2/3 at Bergen or Q/B at 7th ave. Tons of great shops, =
cafes, bars. 10/15 minutes walk to Ft Greene, 10 minutes to Prospect Park=
, 5-10 minutes to Park Slope.=20

Please get in touch soon and tell me a bit about about yourself if intere=
sted. Thanks for reading and I look forward to meeting you! ~~Holly

$800.00 Per Month, Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, Sunny Room in Beautiful 3 bedroom =
apt
Available: Mar 15, 2015 through Dec 31, 2015

Hi everyone,

We&#39;re two women living in a beautiful three bedroom apartment in bed-=
stuy, close to the G and C trains, and the B43 and B52 buses. There are a=
 few coffee shops and restaurants on our street, and a few blocks away on=
 Bedford there are plenty of other offerings.

We&#39;re studious, vibrant, considerate, kind, tidy, and friendly, and a=
re searching for someone to join our family style home. We have a welcomi=
ng and open shared common area, a full kitchen and one and a half bathroo=
ms. We&#39;re looking for someone who can commit to the entirety of the r=
ental period (10 months).

We&#39;re renting the third bedroom, located in the front of the apartmen=
t, which has warm southern exposure and extra privacy. The room doesn&#39=
;t have a closet, but there is a clothing rack, and you&#39;re welcome to=
 add shelves or a wall unit. The room is 12&#39; long and 6&#39; wide. It=
 is a bit narrow, but long and spacious.

Currently, the room fits a full-sized bed, dresser, night table, and clot=
hing rack, but also has space for a small desk. There is extra storage in=
 the basement for any miscellaneous items or boxes that you&#39;d like to=
 store outside the room. (Good for books, suitcases, etc. Furniture is no=
t storable there because of mold). Also, there is free use of the washer =
and dryer unit in the basement.

The apartment is fully furnished, but the room is bare, so it is ideal fo=
r someone who has little to move. (We could however use some art for the =
living / dining area. Our current roommate is taking his with him.) Also,=
 we&#39;d like to replace the rug and paint the walls, so if you&#39;re u=
p for any of that, your input would be welcome.

This apartment is great for someone who enjoys roommate camaraderie; shar=
ing household responsibilities; is considerate of other people&#39;s time=
 and space; and is generally happy and easy to get along with.

Please email me (Joanna) with a little about yourself: job, schedule, and=
 if you feel up to it, hobbies and interests.

No pets, no couples.
Sorry :-(

(There is cat litter in the bathroom picture, but the roommate leaving is=
 taking his cat with him, so the apt. will be pet free.)

$800.00 Per Month, BedStuy, Brooklyn, Room in a community-minded apartmen=
t in a beautiful brownstone
Available: Mar 15, 2015

We have a room open in our community-oriented home in BedStuy, in an amaz=
ing top-floor 5-bedroom apartment, 3 blocks from the Nostrand A/C. We hav=
e a community built around cooking and laughing together, freely communic=
ating, supporting each other, and having fun. We are queer and queer-frie=
ndly, and we&#39;re looking for someone who brings energy and creativity =
to their living environment.

The room is open immediately, and we hope to arrange a move-in no later t=
han March 15. We are hoping you plan to stick around for a year. The rent=
 is $800 plus utilities, which usually run in the $50-60 range per person=
.

About the room and the apartment
The smallest and sunniest room (10&#39; x 7&#39;) in the apartment is ava=
ilable. Its south-facing window gives tons of light, and it opens onto a =
fire escape for quick access to roof sitting in the summer. The main comm=
on space has an open layout, and there are two full bathrooms. There is a=
lso a small guest room with a skylight that has a futon couch--great for =
friends to stay in when they are passing through town! We are also open t=
o making a medium-sized room available for $900, since one of us is open =
to switching to a smaller room.

About us
There are four roommates in the apartment, including a couple, all of who=
m are dedicated to shaping our ideal living environment--this means low d=
rama and shared commitment to making a home. Three of us cut our teeth in=
 the DC communal group house scene, creating a hub there for neighborhood=
 potlucks, gardening, music and poetry shares, and other good stuff.

M is 34 and works for a non-profit that supports social entrepreneurs. In=
 her daydreams (and sometimes in real life), she is a vigilante making th=
e streets safe for biking and for being a woman. She&#39;s at her best wh=
en feeling grateful and adventurous, which happens most when traveling th=
e world (Bangladesh, Burma, Central African Republic, Burning Man, etc.),=
 spending hours cooking with friends and talking about how to live a life=
 that matters, and exploring religion and spirituality.=20

C is a 30-year-old grad student studying philosophy and women&#39;s/gende=
r studies. He spends a lot of time reading and thinking about crazy quest=
ions about life and nature, but he counterbalances that with quality time=
 with friends, homebuilding, and exploring the city. He likes interacting=
 with people and builds his relationships around listening, laughing, and=
 playing games. He grew up in a small rural town outside of Northampton, =
MA (behind the tofu curtain, as they say), which is reflected in a love o=
f cooking with soy sauce and cider vinegar.

M, also 30, is a musician who loves technology and creating positive soci=
al impact in the world. At home, he likes to cook, pick up the mandolin, =
and laugh really hard. He&#39;s currently working freelance, but he&#39;s=
 looking to go to grad school.

P is 25 and currently spends most of her time working for a civic sector =
consulting firm, which helps non-profits and government agencies solve pr=
oblems/function better. Two of her craziest ideas to-date include pursuin=
g a Master of Divinity and hiking in the Himalayas for 30 days with two p=
airs of underwear. When at home, P enjoys cooking and eating bacon, as we=
ll as making meals with friends.

About you
Tell us who you are and what you are passionate about. What is your exper=
ience with communal/cooperative living? What are you looking for in a liv=
ing situation? Also, let us know what you do for work and how else you li=
ke to spend your time. Unfortunately, if a pet is a part of your life, it=
 won&#39;t be able to come live in the apartment. :(

Please reply with enough detail to give us a good sense of yourself. We l=
ook forward to hearing from you soon!

The neighborhood is surrounded by bucolic parks and daily strolls to the =
Cloisters are inevitable.

$1,410.00 Per Month, Alphabet City, New York, 80 sq. ft., 1 Bedroom Avail=
able in an Alphabet City 2 BR
Available: Apr 01, 2015 through Aug 31, 2015

1 bedroom opening up in a 2 bedroom apartment in Alphabet City on April 1=
st. Rent is $1410/month. Security deposit is also $1410. No broker fee. T=
he lease runs through August, as would the sublet. Love the place, but st=
ill up in the air about signing on after that. Utilities can vary dependi=
ng on the season, but we only pay internet and electric, which often come=
s out to about $100/month total.=20

About the room: Unfurnished. Roughly 8&#39; by 10&#39;. It&#39;s small, b=
ut fits a full sized bed, night stand, and chest of drawers. There is a c=
loset.=20

About the apartment: This is a pretty damn great space. It has an open ki=
tchen and living room area. I cook a lot (but not particularly well), so =
the kitchen is kept clean. The rest is as expected of a busy New York lif=
estyle. We stay on top of it, but I&#39;m totally understanding of when t=
he cleaning falls behind a little bit due to hectic schedules. Sometimes,=
 on hungover Saturdays, I will find some previously unknown mental streng=
th and clean like a madman. The bathroom is okay. Some of its parts are l=
ong in the tooth, but they get the job done. We do also have a rooftop, w=
hich is nice in the summers. There are some things going with my roommate=
, including the couch and dining room table. We&#39;ll probably want to r=
eplace those. That&#39;s what Ikea is for. Maybe we&#39;ll have a Red Hoo=
k roommate bonding trip that involves drinking, poor decisions, and furni=
ture shopping in no particular order.=20

About me: I&#39;m Ben. I&#39;m 28. I work in television production. My ho=
urs can sometimes be crazy, but for the most part I work from 9 to about =
7. I have a pretty busy life, but like to unwind at home on the weekdays.=
 I like going out and grabbing impromptu beers, trivia nights, rec sports=
 (I love soccer too much), escaping the city for hikes, yadda yadda yadda=
. I am a smart ass, constantly sarcastic, open minded, frequently guilty =
of mansplaining, and think I&#39;m smarter than I actually am with a few =
beers in me. I go to the local institution known as Parkside Lounge on a =
regular basis, where those qualities can all be on display, often at the =
same time.=20

About you: I&#39;d hope to find someone close to my age and station in li=
fe. As long as you are marginally clean, we won&#39;t have any problems t=
here. I tend to enjoy outgoing people, who are active, and work hard. But=
, that&#39;s not to say that I can&#39;t be a lazy bones. I most certainl=
y am that too, and pizza and movie nights are frequent in the apartment. =
If you are the type to go off into your room every night when you get hom=
e, or disappear for days on end, then this probably won&#39;t work well. =
My friends and I are all really inclusive, and our apartment is great for=
 hanging out.=20

The Big Finale: I loved my previous roommate, but she gets to go off and =
do awesome things in Paris. I&#39;d really like to find someone who share=
s some similar interests, so we can actually have some fun. If you are co=
ming to take a look at the apartment, be prepared to share a beer afterwa=
rd. Also, if you&#39;re responding to this posting, share a little bit ab=
out yourself. I will probably disregard any brief messages.

ly also female and also in her mid to late twenties. We both work in fash=
ion and enjoy having a quiet safe space to come home to. We enjoy cooking=
 and keeping our living space clean and we hope to find a roommate who is=
 looking for the same kind of living environment.

We share the apartment with a very special senior english bulldog, who sp=
ends most of his time in his mom&#39;s room sleeping. Because we already =
house one dog, we are not looking to house any more pets.

The room available has a sizable closet and one large window facing the c=
ourtyard. (not a street side room) I&#39;m not sure the square footage, b=
ut it fits a queen size bed, a few dressers and a night stand or two.

The apt has a huge living room with two windows, a full separate kitchen =
with a window and a small bathroom. (if interested i will send pix over o=
f the rest of the apt)

We are off the 9ave D train stop--so we are about 15 minutes to both lowe=
r manhattan and atlantic terminal.

The new roommate must be lgbtq friendly.

Please Email to get in touch!

Thanks,
Anna &amp; Anh

$625.00, Bushwick, Brooklyn, 200 sq. ft., Sunny, Cozy and Private 2-week =
Sublet
Available: Mar 19, 2015 through Apr 02, 2015

We have a two-week sublet available in Bushwick. The room is available fr=
om 3/19-4/2. It&#39;s a lofted bedroom in a two-bedroom apartment. Can be=
 flexible on shorter dates, but not longer because we&#39;ll be living he=
re up until the 19th and will continue to live here when we come back. Th=
e rent for the two weeks is $625 and due up front. The room is furnished =
and you have to smoke outside the building. There are already two cats he=
re, so no pets please. Couples are OK. =20

The bedroom portion of the room (mattress and sitting area) is upstairs a=
nd there are two desks and a small couch downstairs. You&#39;ll be sharin=
g the apartment with my friendly roommate and his two friendly cats. Both=
 bedrooms are at opposite sides of the apartment and have French doors th=
at open into a central kitchen area. The kitchen is quite big (eat-in), h=
as all the requisite modern appliances and the ceilings are about 14 feet=
 tall, so overall it feels big.=20

The bedroom portion of our room has low ceilings, meaning you can&#39;t s=
tand up in the room (the ceilings are probably around 4 ft. tall). That b=
eing said, who really stands up in bed? I&#39;m a 6-foot tall man and I g=
et around just fine. See the pictures, or better yet, come by and see it =
for yourself. It&#39;s quite cozy. There are some wonderful, floor-level =
cushions that my girlfriend made from memory foam and upholstered herself=
. The downstairs couch also folds out, so you could sleep there as well.=20=


Our first priority is to find someone trustworthy and responsible. We&#39=
;d like to meet any potential subleasers before they move in, if possible=
. Please tell us about yourself, why you need a short-term place and why =
we should trust you in our home. Thanks and feel free to ask any question=
s.

$60.00 Per Day, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, Two private room sublets in beauti=
ful Fort Green brownstone
Available: Mar 22, 2015 through May 22, 2015

Hi there,

There are 2 different rooms available for potential sublet in our beautif=
ul Fort Green brownstone.

Our home is on a lovely tree lined street half a block from restaurants, =
bars and the Brooklyn Flea. There is easy access via a variety of subways=
 to Manhattan. We are also just a few blocks from Fort Greene Park and th=
e weekly farmers market. The neighborhood also has a great variety of res=
taurants and bars, as well as local gyms and yoga studios.

The house itself is 3 floors. The house is an historic Brooklyn turn of t=
he century brownstone. The first floor is the kitchen and living space wi=
th access to our back deck and yard. The great advantage to this floor is=
 that it has no bedrooms, so you can come and go with whatever schedule y=
ou need and not bother anyone sleeping.=20
We have a large living room with couches and tv. The kitchen has an 8 sea=
ter table to entertain at and a fully stocked kitchen for the avid cook! =
This floor also has a washer and dryer.

Upstairs 1 floor is the bathroom and 2 bedrooms. The top floor has 2 bedr=
ooms, where both of the potential sublets are.

Room 1 - $60 / night, available from March 26th. Maximum stay a week (giv=
e or take - let us know what you&#39;re after). This bedroom is compact a=
nd cozy with a full size bed and a great view of the leafy green yard. Th=
e room itself is quite small but perfect for a short term visit. This is =
a wonderful place to say but not suited to someone with a lot of luggage,=
 since the floor space in the room is limited and no closets are availabl=
e.

Room 2 - $1500 for a month, from March 22nd at the earliest (again give o=
r take, just let us know). This is a really peaceful large sized double r=
oom, with a Queen-sized bed (with memory-foam mattress!), walk in wardrob=
e, a couch, small desk and plenty of storage. Again, this room is super q=
uiet, with lots of natural light a view of the yard and trees.

Living in the house normally are a creative bunch of 3 guys, 1 girl and 2=
 kitties. This is a relaxed and easygoing household that can be a great b=
ase for a fun trip to NYC, whatever your reasons.

We all enjoy having people to stay with us, and love being able to provid=
e a short term option for creative people in need who are passing through=
 NYC, or in between homes. Please get in touch for information.

Thanks!

res, bodegas, dollar stores, laundromats, and, of course, restaurants and=
 bars. Oh, and did I forget to mention you&#39;d be a short walk from The=
 Cloisters?!

I am a dramaturg and writer in my mid-20&#39;s who works at a publishing =
company. I&#39;m a chill and easygoing person; the one thing I ask is tha=
t you help keep the apartment clean. If you&#39;re interested tell me a l=
ittle bit about yourself, your ideal move in date, and how long you wish =

ny, Furnished Room 2 blocks from Q/B &amp; Prospect Park
Available: Mar 15, 2015 through May 31, 2015

 I have a big, beautiful, sunny 2nd-floor apartment in a row house in Pro=
spect Lefferts Garden. (Last year, our block was named the Greenest Block=
 in Brooklyn! http://www.bbg.org/greenbridge/greenest_block_2013)

I&#39;m looking for a subletter for the next three months, but the exact =
length of the let is negotiable. Available March 1. I&#39;m just looking =
for an individual; no couples.

The apartment is large. A big living room/kitchen, a den, two bedrooms, a=
 study, and a good-sized bathroom.

The available bedroom is furnished (bed, dresser, shelves, rug, lamps, ar=
m chair) and weighs in at 150 square feet, plus a decent closet.

Rent is $1200 a month, which includes utilities (heat, elec, wifi).

I&#39;m a writer and a teacher, which means I am around a lot, but in a q=
uiet way. I keep the place pretty clean, not a lot of clutter, empty sink=
 at night. I don&#39;t smoke. I&#39;m looking for someone civil and frien=
dly who has a job and a community and needs a warm, comfortable home for =
a few months.

Apartment is on Sterling Street (not Sterling Place) b/w Bedford and Wash=
ington, very close to Prospect Park and the Botanic Garden. A five-minute=
 walk from the Prospect Park stop of the B/Q train. City-wise, we&#39;re =
about a 20-minute ride to Union Square.

If you&#39;re interested, get in touch and we can set up a time to look a=
t the place,
Judson

$1,200.00 Per Month, Bushwick, Brooklyn, Spacious sunlit bedroom + Separa=
te Office available!
Available: Mar 15, 2015

Hello! I am taking some time away from the city and am looking for someon=
e to fill my beloved bedroom long-term, beginning March 15th (March 20th =
move-in OK too). You&#39;ll be living with my best friend. Our apartment =
is the top of a house on a cute tree-lined street in Bushwick, surrounded=
 by a great community of neighbors we have grown to love over the many ye=
ars we have lived here. We are looking for someone who will respect the s=
pace as well as the families around our home.

My bedroom has 3 large windows and gets plenty of sunlight. The room real=
ly is huge, look at all the stuff I can keep in it!  A gorgeous, massive =
 mirror with original molding is in the center, adding character to the r=
oom that you wont find in new construction.  The pictured armoire can be =
moved around to fit your style, and you still can fit a queen size bed, a=
nother dresser, and/or a little seating area for reading or a yoga mat.=20=

=20
Bedroom:=20
	Size:  17.5ft X 11.5ft=20
	Separate Entrance=20
	Lots of light with tall windows facing street
	Huge Decorative Mirror
	Standing armoire for hanging clothes and plenty of closets throughout ap=
artment to share
	Unfurnished (Im selling a full size bed and/or bedframe if you need one)=

	Folding doors open the room to the dining room, but other bedroom is on =
opposite side of the apt so privacy/noise has never been an issue.

The bedroom also connects to a separate shared Office/Studio Space (10ft =
X 7.5ft) w/ additional separate entrance from hallway. My current roommat=
e tends to work in other areas of the apartment, so shes willing to give =
up the window and help organize to fit your needs.=20

	Rent: $1200 + Split Utilities (electric, internet, gas); Heat &amp; Hot =
Water Included
	1st months (pro-rated) + month security  to move in
	No Pets/ No Party Parties (Landlords Rules  she lives on premises) but g=
uests are welcome for things like dinner parties or movie nights
	No Couples/ No Bevers of Broad City Situations
	Charming entrance with skylight and exposed brick
	1 Bathroom to share w/ my very clean roomie
	Kitchen, living, and dining room fully furnished=20

Like I said, you&#39;ll be living with my best friend. Very chill. Freela=
ncer and production whiz sometimes working from home sometimes long hours=
 outside of the house.  Late 20s, very creative and social individual but=
 also enjoys peace and quiet / privacy. Seriously, the best roommate ever=
. Just meet her and you&#39;ll see, weve successfully lived together for =
over 5 years.

First month&#39;s rent and security deposit due up front. The rent is due=
 at the beginning of every month - since this is a mid-month move-in, the=
 first month will be pro-rated accordingly.

This apartment has been our home for a very long time. Well be doing some=
 deep cleaning and paint touchups prior to move in date, but my roommate =
will also want to work with you to make sure the vibe and dcor of the apa=
rtment make you feel just as at home as we have over the years.

Thanks!

$2,100.00 Per Month, Downtown, Brooklyn, 430 sq. ft., Quaint 1-bedroom fl=
oor-through
Available: Mar 15, 2015

Hi, I&#39;m a choreographer/movement trainer who lives in a 3-family buil=
ding of friendly artists. I&#39;m currently seeking to rent the 3rd floor=
 walk-up apartment in this quaint antique brick building. It&#39;s 3 conn=
ected rooms plus a small side room that could be an office or storage roo=
m. It has lovely original molding, hard wood floors, tin ceilings and 6 w=
indows. It&#39;s a good kitchen for real cooking with a granite counterto=
p, and there&#39;s a washer/dryer included in the apartment. Heat, water =
and hot water are included.
We are convenient to many trains; Manhattan is 1 or 2 stops, or a short b=
ike ride over the Manhattan bridge one block away.=20
I believe that because of its set-up, this apartment works best for a sin=
gle person, maybe a very close couple, but not 2 roommates. No smoking is=
 allowed in the building, and no dogs, sorry. We can accommodate move-in =
dates from March 15 to April 1. The initial lease is for one year, with t=
he option to renew after.

I am the owner of the building and I also live here. Since my tenants hav=
e not vacated the third floor yet, they have been generously showing the =
apartment for me at times that are convenient for them. I&#39;ll be showi=
ng it myself on Saturday.

$1,000.00 Per Week, Near Park Slope, Brooklyn, NY, Searching for sublet f=
or visiting grandma, May 20ish-June 10ish
Available: May 21, 2015 through Jun 07, 2015

My mom flies in from India on May 20 to see her new granddaughter (knock =
on wood), and I&#39;d love to find a two-week sublet for her to stay in. =
She keeps things extremely clean, and is quiet and private. It would be g=
reat if the place were an easy walk or at least a bus ride to where I liv=
e near 7th Ave. and Flatbush -- so, Prospect Heights and North/Central Sl=
ope would be ideal. But anywhere from South Slope to Clinton Hill would b=
e fine. Thank you!

$1,250.00 Per Month, anything proximal to downtown brklyn, brooklyn, awes=
ome new family seeking housing
Available: Mar 11, 2015

Hello open minded artistic types out there,

We are a warm mid 30&#39;s couple with a 9 month old girl, a middle aged =
terrier dog-ter named Jetfire Birdie and an old man guinea pig, Mr. Piggi=
e Patches. We need a place to live. Looking for a share (or private) situ=
ation with sunlight and space. With you if you are warm too. Sublet or le=
ase fine. Furnished or not, ok.

Who We Are:
We are A: singer, voice teacher, puppeteer, actor, arts foundation admini=
strator, sometimes director, kidsitter
N: 9 month old gal. Curious, fierce, patient, mellow
P: maker, metal fabricator, mechanic, kind hearted person
JFB: middle aged pooch- about 20 lbs, very pretty, has a soulful voice
MPP: geriatric - guinea pig

Our Lifestyle:
We are chill for the most part. We walk the dog a few times a day, work p=
art time jobs trading off on childcare responsibilities, A and N go to be=
d early, P is a night owl.
We enjoy sharing food, whether that means we share everything or just a r=
andom meal, we can all decide.=20
We like plants, animals, friends.
We like making things. Singing. Also being quiet.=20
We like to have a warm welcoming home and also privacy.
We like a clean house but a lived in space.
We have everything we own in storage and plan to keep out possessions to =
a minimum for now (realizing, though, we have a child who also has stuff)=
.

What We Are Looking For:
Ideally we&#39;d live in a part of a house share in Sunset Park near the =
36th st stop and park, Kensington near the Church Ave F/G or in Ditmas ne=
ar Courtelyou or Newkirk or  Lefferts near the park, or Fort Greene (wher=
e we lived for 11 years), or Park Slope, Cobble Hill, Vinegar Hill or lot=
s of other places. Prefer to be on an Orange (F, B, D) or Yellow (R, N, Q=
) or train line since 3 of my jobs are.=20

We would be open to 1) subletting your furnished room or apartment, 2) re=
nting a large room (or small room with adjoining space for baby) in your =
house or apartment, 3) finding a larger house to fill with housemates=20

 Ideally housemates would like having a dog and a remarkably charming and=
 chill child around. We take her out A Lot. She joins me at work in the a=
fternoons, so it&#39;s not a situation where a baby is home all day. She =
loves live music, so if you play and instrument that&#39;s awesome.

Amenities like a washing machine (or hook ups to put in our own), a dishw=
asher, a parking spot, a yard, a porch are all desirable bonuses. If not =
a house or elevator building, we&#39;d love to live on a low level (i.e.-=
 not a  4 story walk up) since we have a baby and a dog.


Our Story:
 We lived in a great 2 story share with a revolving cast of creatives cha=
racters in Fort Greene for 11 years and had to move when our daughter was=
 2 weeks old due to the owners deciding to sell. We then lived in another=
 share for 7 month which we had to leave due to That apt also selling. No=
w we are guest room hopping and having a really fantastic time moving fro=
m area to area and seeing lots of friends, but we really need a room some=
where. We are without a home. We will entertain any short or long term op=
tions at the moment.

We have great references and can send you testimonials from past housemat=
es, or hosts.

Hello. I recently relocated to NYC and am looking a new place to live.=20=


I&#39;m a mid-30s professional guy - landscape architect, designer, and c=
reative artistic person all around. As a tenant, i can provide excellent =
references from previous landlords. I am also a homeowner so I respect an=
y dwelling like its my own. I live clean and minimal, and would love to f=
ind a cool old space that has been recently renovated with lots of natura=
l light. A tree-lined street in a cool walkable neighborhood, with trains=
 nearby, would be ideal.

I&#39;m not home much during the weekdays (work, gym, dinner, repeat). Lo=
ve to sleep in on the weekends and relax or spend time exploring NYC. I&#=
39;m looking for a nice studio space or a roomate that has a similar laid=
-back lifestyle.=20

4 pics below are my Miami condo. The rest are a good example of what I&#3=
9;m looking for in NYC. If you have something to offer along these lines =
- I&#39;d love to hear from you.

Thanks!

Call for entry or representation, $40.00 Fee, NY, New York, Baang + Burne=
 New Works Grant and Gallery Representation 2014-15
Available: Jan 01, 2015 through Mar 31, 2015

Dear Artists,
=20
Welcome to Baang + Burne 2014-15 Call to Entry / New Works Grant.
Entry Deadline: 3/31/15
=20
This is the third year Baang + Burne has hosted a Call for Entry / New Wo=
rks Grant. A spot on our gallery rosterrepresentation and/ or a $2,500 ca=
sh award that recognizes the strongest new works proposal in contemporary=
 art.
=20
I know some of you must be wondering what is this all about, how is it di=
fferent from all the other call for entries out there and what is in it f=
or you.
=20
Lets start with what is Baang + Burne.
=20
Baang + Burne is founded in 2010 by artist Kesha Bruce and myself. I came=
 from 15 years of advertising and a career as a documentarian; Kesha has =
a solid track record as a fine art artist with an MFA from Hunter College=
. We wanted to do something different. We are romantic and idealistic in =
our belief of what art could be, the kind of advocates artists should hav=
e (creative, passionate, out-of-the-box-thinkers) and the type of dealers=
 collectors should do business with (ethical and honest). The combination=
 is tall order. So we created it ourselves.
=20
Through 4 long years of exhibits, art fairs, auctions and collaborations,=
 Baang + Burne has evolved into what it is today  and it is still growing=
. We are somewhere between a traditional gallery and an artist collective=
. You are represented and spirit of collaboration is our core value. Art =
is a long game and we will only ever come out of this alive if we are in =
it together.
=20
Joshua King, Dominic Sansone, Richard Hart and Nathan Sharratt are four w=
onderful artists we connected with and currently represent during our pre=
vious call for entry. Cat del Bueno was our first new works grant recipie=
nt.
=20
Baang + Burne is growing and we are looking for you.
=20
Everyone has limited resources and time. Those are put under further rest=
raints when you are an artist. We get it. If the fee is not within your b=
udget, then please, do not submit. If being a part of Baang + Burne excit=
es you, then we would love to see what youve been up to. If youve got a p=
roject underway and some money would help it along, click submit and put =
your name in the hat. We want to help you make new art.
=20
We spent an enormous amount of time looking at what comes our way. Your s=
ubmissions are not taken lightly. This is a place of mutual respect. We r=
espect you for what you do and we ask you to extend us the same considera=
tion.
=20
Baang + Burne is growing. We are looking for you. Join us.
=20
Warmly,
=20
