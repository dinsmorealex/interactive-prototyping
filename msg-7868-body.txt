Label News

Hi everyone and welcome to the Sorry State Records update for
October!

In case you didn't get our mid-month update, we have two new releases
from Whatever Brains, who just put out their insanely great
SSR-63/SSR-64 double 12" EP, and No Love, who are coming at you with
Tape #2. The Brains record is limited to 300 and the No Love tape is
only 100, and both are well on their way to selling out, so I highly
suggest grabbing these soon if you want them. Also, if you want to see
them at your local record store tell them to get in touch with us soon
before they run out! Oh, and speaking of Whatever Brains we still have
all of their previous records on sale, so if you haven't picked those
up do it now!

In general webstore news, we just made it so that all domestic orders
(i.e. those shipping within the US) get free shipping as long as you
buy at least $60 worth of stuff. I may make this a permanent thing to
encourage larger orders... not sure at the moment, but I'll keep this
going for at least a week, so grab a big pile of cool stuff! You don't
have to do anything... the free shipping will be included
automatically at checkout.

It feels like I've been talking forever about the upcoming releases,
and since last month we've had some movement on some projects and no
movement on others. It's looking like the Louder LP will be the first
of the new batch of full-lengths to come out since that's the only one
we have completed artwork for. However, we already have the jackets
for the first volume of the North Carolina singles series, so as soon
as we have the vinyl for the Davidians single we'll put that up for
sale. In other singles series news, we're expecting test presses of
the No Love single (the second volume in the series) in the next
couple of days and I couldn't be more stoked. I realized the other day
that I haven't played on an actual piece of vinyl since the Logic
Problem LP 4 or 5 years ago.

Aside from that we just keep plugging along here in Raleigh. We've
been doing our best to keep the store stocked with sick used records
(sorry, though, I had to take that minty copy of Youth Brigade's
Possible EP home...) and the latest new jams.

Jeff's Update

What's Up Sorry Staters?

For distro stuff this month, even though September had a ton of new
releases come through the door, I'm gonna stick to the bare
essentials.  As far as hardcore is concerned, some absolute must-haves
are the new DiE - Vexed 7" and Koward - Desperate 7"  -- two bands in
punk that for my money are doing it the right way.  Also, for a
different pace, I have to say that I am really into the new Total
Control - Typical System LP.  Has the right blend post-punk, new wave,
and krautrock, but really just boils down to good songs.

In other news, it's good to see the new Sorry State releases slowly
but surely showing up on the store's doorstep.  The new Whatever
Brains is finally out, and I'm sure the other records SSR has had in
the works will be on close on the heels of that.

It's strange that I've been back from Skem=C3=A4ta tour for a while now
and we're still waiting on the official press of our LP.  From what I
understand, they should be here any time now.  We have a couple shows
coming up in early-to-mid November, and hopefully we'll have the LPs
by then.  One of those shows is with Forward and Long Knife, so that
should be killer!  Also, I'll take this time to say that I am beyond
excited to announce that Solar Funeral will also be releasing an EP
with 3 new Skem=C3=A4ta songs in early 2015!

I mentioned in a previous newsletter that two guys in Mercy Killings
had some pretty serious medical issues.  Both of those dudes are back
on their feet, so we'll probably be busy again pretty soon.  Beach
Impediment will be dropping our second 7" at any time now, so keep an
eye out!

That all from me for now I think. Thanks for reading!

Seth's Update

Get the new Whatever Brains 12=E2=80=9D! I=E2=80=99m sure Daniel has =
plenty to say
about it in his section and he=E2=80=99s better at describing things
anyways. Like every new WB record it expands on their last one, going
in a new direction but still keeping the essence of the Brains.

We got the Juanita Y Los Feos LP back in stock! I wanted to write
about this last month but by the time it came to the end of the month
we were sold out. I have been listening to this LP obsessively. Super
catchy vocals and melodies, synth but not going overboard with it, and
just an overall good flow with the whole LP. The overall album has a
dark atmosphere but with a pop attitude. You can go over to La Vida Es
Un Mus=E2=80=99 bandcamp and check it out (i suggest listening to =
Revolucion
Canibal).We also got the Primetime 7=E2=80=9D (also on La Vida Es Un Mus)
back in. Tied down is one of the best songs, very Delta 5 sounding. If
you like any of the stuff coming out of london right now then =
you=E2=80=99ll
be into this.

The new King Tuff album has been on a lot at the shop the past couple
days. Headbanger is definitely the hit for me. It=E2=80=99s one of those
songs that finishes and you want to just start over. If you were a fan
of his last album then you=E2=80=99ll definitely like this one.

TOTAL CONTROL! If you haven=E2=80=99t heard their new LP do yourself a =
favor
and just buy it. It=E2=80=99s an amazing record from beginning to end. It
still has a gloomy feel to it but with a clearer production. It
bounces around between genres while still just sounding like Total
Control. I=E2=80=99m pretty sure everyone at the store has been listening =
to
this record non-stop.

Other awesome new records: Ukiah Drag LP, Poison Girls - Hex, The
Wipers-Nome Noma 7=E2=80=9D, Die-Vexed 7=E2=80=9D, Gorilla - Mary Anne =
7=E2=80=9D,
Hurula LP, and of course TEENGENERATE! Oh yeah also maybe the new No
Love Tape if you=E2=80=99re into that.

-Seth

Daniel's Update

Seth did a pretty good job of covering the bases for the essential
releases of the month, but I'll say that September was one of the
strongest months for new releases all year... I'm sure you're bound to
see the DiE 7", the Glue 7", and the Total Control LP on a number of
year-end lists, and for good reason... they're all incredible records
that you pretty much need to own if you're the kind of person who
reads these updates.

I'll also agree with Seth that the restocks from La Vida Es Un Mus are
essential... I still haven't grown tired of the Juanita Y Los Feos LP
or the Prime Time 7".

One record that Seth didn't mention is the new Pusrad 12" on Dead
Beat. You may think that you have Pusrad pretty much figured out by
now, and it's not like they stopped writing short songs or anything,
but this new record really steps things up. It actually deserves a
Wire comparison not just because the songs are so short, but also
because they're really, really good and memorable. I don't think I
ever listen to the record fewer than 3 times in a row when I put it
on.

I feel like there are a lot fewer descriptions this month because I've
been so stretched for time, but that also means that only the best
releases have been graced with my wordsmithery, so I'll stop writing
here so you can check it out below!

Featured Distro Items

Pig DNA: Control You Fucker #3 7" (Night Rider)
After a couple of well-regarded demo tapes we finally get a slab of
vinyl from this noisy Bay Area hardcore band. This kind of
balls-to-wall, nearly-abstract noise punk doesn't really seem to be as
in vogue as it was a couple of years ago, and I'm not sure if that's
why Pig DNA sound so fresh or if it's just that they're really, really
good at it. The guitars are definitely informed by the Kyushu classics
(as well as newer stuff like Lebenden Toten) as this is a total noise
attack with a weird kind of drifting phase effect over all of the
guitars. I think what makes Pig DNA different, though, is that this
layer of noise gets put down on a foundation of well-written hardcore
songs. The vocalist actually reminds me a little of Jordan from Dark
Ages, and the rhythm section definitely has the same kind of snappy
hardcore attack, but then there are those total wall of noise
guitars... if all of the Confuse-worshipping "myspace crust" bands of
a few years ago didn't wear you out on this style of noisecore this is
one you'll want to check out as it's definitely a cut above.

No Love: Tape #2 cassette (Sorry State)
After an earlier self-released demo, Raleigh, North Carolina=E2=80=99s No
Love move to Sorry State proper for their second release. Dispensing
with some of the poppier tendencies of their demo, No Love play
fist-pumping melodic punk along the lines of the Buzzcocks, the
Avengers, and the Canadian Subhumans, occasionally augmented with the
sarcastic snap of bands like the Angry Samoans. Tape #2 contains four
new tracks recorded by Colin Swanson-White (Davidians), and the new
recording does a much better job of capturing the band=E2=80=99s dense
combination of melodic bass lines, dueling lead guitar and anthemic
vocals. Cassettes are professionally duplicated and come with a
digital download. Limited to 100 copies.

Whatever Brains: SSR-63/SSR-64 2x12" EP (Sorry State)
Whatever Brains have always been a band inclined toward the grand
statement, but their latest release reaches new levels of epic. Not a
conventional LP or a double LP, SSR-63/SSR-64 is actually two separate
EPs packaged as one. SSR-63 is a single 22-minute track spread across
both sides of a 45RPM 12". A series of linked compositions a la
Venom=E2=80=99s At War with Satan or the Subhumans=E2=80=99 From the =
Cradle to the
Grave, SSR-63=E2=80=99s lyrics chronicle the plight of a Russian family =
who
lived in complete isolation in remote Siberia for more than 40 years.
The music is similarly wide in scope, drifting organically from
maximalist punk to minimalist, country-tinged lament to pumping
electronica in an astoundingly natural fashion. As for the other
12=E2=80=9D, it=E2=80=99s a new 4-song EP called SSR-64, which continues =
to
develop the wide sonic palette that the best tracks on their previous
LP hinted at. SSR-64 also delivers =E2=80=9CUVOD,=E2=80=9D the closest =
thing to a
pop hit Whatever Brains have ever created. As ever, a good portion of
the people reading this will be confused and repulsed by the Whatever
Brains, while the remainder will insist vocally that this is one of
the most truly innovative and exciting records of 2014.

I should also mention the physical characteristics of this release,
because it=E2=80=99s one that you=E2=80=99re definitely going to want to =
own on
vinyl. First of all, we put a lot of effort (and money) into mastering
for this release, and the result is easily the best-sounding
(fidelity-wise, at least) record that Sorry State has ever produced.
Since we splurged on the sonics, we=E2=80=99ve done our best to keep the
price of this thing low with screen printed jackets made from recycled
materials. In a world of tossed-off, insta-file releases, holding
SSR-63/SSR-64 in your hands will make you realize why you still care
about vinyl.

DiE: Vexed 7" (Sonic Terror)
Second EP from the almighty DiE, to my mind the best hardcore band
going in the UK right now, though they definitely have some
competition from bands like the Flex, Perspex Flesh, Violent Reaction,
and Arms Race. Anyway, everyone flipped out over this band's first EP,
and with good reason... it's straight up one of the best hardcore
records in recent memory. Things have changed just a little bit for
the second EP... while there are some definite hardcore stompers here
(quite a few, in fact), it feels like the balance has tilted slightly
toward a more frantic, kind of unhinged sound. There's a lot more lead
guitar on this one, and the songs are generally shorter, faster, and
more to the point. The band's main selling point, though--those
insanely powerful vocals--are back in full force, and even the fastest
tracks have a singalong quality that very, very few bands can
successfully emulate. In other words, this is just similar enough that
everyone who loved their first EP that will love it, but just
different enough so that it doesn't feel like more of the same.
Utterly essential.

Gorilla: Mary Anne 7" (Three Dimensional)
Two-song 45 of full-on power pop worship from this Japanese band.
Everyone knows that the Japanese are the absolute best when it comes
to retro culture, and this single is as spot-on as you would expect.
If you dig the type of thing that Sing Sing generally reissues, or
just power-pop in the Big Star / Paul Collins / Nerves / Exploding
Hearts tradition this will be right up your alley... total
Rickenbacker rock.

Secta Suicida: S/T 7" (MMM)
Debut 7" from this killer new band out of Bogota, Colombia, released
on MMM, Josh from Ruleta Rusa's label. It's easy to see why this
caught Josh's ear, as it's almost strikingly similar in places... like
Ruleta Rusa (as well as the singer's old band, Peligro Social), Secta
Suicida perfectly combine the old melodic Spanish punk sound
exemplified by Eskorbuto with the energy of hardcore. Basically, if
you like Ruleta Rusa or Peligro Social you should get this, because
these four catchy hardcore punk songs are absolutely top-notch.

Hurula: S/T 12" (No Good)
While I really wish he would spend his time bugging Marcus to do more
Inst=C3=A4ngd releases, it's good to see that Robert from the Vicious /
Masshysteri is back at it. His new band Hurula pretty much picks up
where the last Masshysteri record left off, perhaps moving even more
in a pop direction. Honestly, I think this sound suits him a lot
better... I think Masshysteri's last record was their best one, and
it's good to hear him push the music further with more complex
instrumentation and arrangements rather than being tied down to having
to be "punk." Not that this isn't punk... it's still loud, but the pop
sensibility is at the forefront. At any rate, if you were a
Masshysteri fan you'll definitely want to pick this up. Note: this is
the European pressing on No Good Records.

Video: Cult of Video 7" (No Good)
Brand new single from this Texas band, released on German label and
likely kind of difficult to find in the US. These guys immediately
came out of the gate with an utterly distinctive sound that had the
energy of hardcore, the melody of the best garage/punk bands, and a
new wave/post-punk informed sense of dynamism. On their recent 7" on
Total Punk as well as this new single they evolve very slightly,
laying down a bit heavier on the psych-informed guitar freakout, but
basically if you dug the pumping, driving, and catchy punk that
appeared on their other releases this is no less essential. I still
think they kind of sound like the Adolescents and, still, no one
really agrees with me, but if you like catchy, energetic punk in that
style this is definitely a band you want to check out.

Genocide Pact: Desecration 7" (Bad Teeth)
Debut 7" from this Washington, DC death metal band featuring Connor
from Protester on drums. I'm often wary of hardcore kids playing
metal, but this is pretty legit death metal... you won't find any real
trace of hardcore influence, just straight up gnarly metal. The
production is clear, powerful, and heavy in line with the great
Florida bands of the late 80s and early 90s, and the songwriting and
riffing is top-notch as well. It's not as overtly catchy as, say,
Death's early stuff, but fans of Obituary and the like will dig this
hard... definitely one I'd recommend for you metalheads out there.

Wipers: Nome Noma 7" (Meanbean)
Not to be confused with the much more famous Portland band of the
same name, Meanbean Records' debut release is a reissue of the 1980
single by this obscure Toronto punk band. I hadn't heard of this
before the reissue, which is surprising because this is a top-notch
early punk record from a city with a well-known scene. Maybe it was
that this record was a bit behind the times... by 1980 the original
'77 punk scene that this single owes its clearest sonic debt to was
dying out and making way for hardcore, of which you'll find none here.
However, if your idea of punk is bands like Teenage Head, the Pointed
Sticks, Lost Kids, Buzzcocks, etc., these two tracks will hit your
sweet spot. Definitely recommended for all of you '77 punk / KBD heads
out there.

Nightfell: The Ever Living Mourn 12" (Southern Lord)
Debut LP from this new Portland project featuring Todd from Tragedy /
His Hero Is Gone and Tim from Aldebaran/Mournful Congregation. If I
had to choose one adjective to describe this record it would certainly
be BLEAK. While I'm sure Tragedy fans can get down with this... after
all, Todd's songwriting style is definitely apparent and there's
something of Tragedy's epic sweep in nearly every track here, but it's
sort of like they took away all of the catchier, more anthemic aspects
of Tragedy and left all of the bleak dirginess. It's definitely more
metal, leaning toward a kind of blackened doom sound, but there's a
lot of Hellhammer's primitive, almost punk take on metal as well.
Apparently this project came out of the members dealing with a bunch
of tragedy and loss, and that definitely comes across in the music...
it's the kind of record you listen to alone, in the dark, when you're
pondering how much life sucks.

Brotherhood: Till Death 12" (Southern Lord)
So this was a bit of a surprise... I know that Southern Lord has been
re-releasing a bunch of 80s hardcore over the past few years, but I
didn't expect them to start mining the well of late 80s straight edge
/ youth crew obscurities. However, Southern Lord owner / Sunn O)))
guitarist Greg Anderson was the guitarist in Brotherhood, so I guess
it makes sense (though he isn't even the most famous Brotherhood
alumnus... bassist Nate Mendel went on to play in Foo Fighters(!)).
Anyway, I remember owning the old Crucial Response version of this LP
back in the day and sold it in a purge of nearly all of my old youth
crew records, but revisiting this years down the line it's actually
way more ripping than I remember. It's definitely of its time and
isn't really breaking the mold in any way, but it's a concise,
well-recorded, and powerful document of the sound and style. At their
best Brotherhood could approach the stop/start intensity of Straight
Ahead (as they do on the classic first track, "The Deal"), and they
also have a bit common with the post-Youth of Today generation of NYHC
/ CBGB bands... bands like Breakdown, Outburst, Sick of It All, etc.
At its core, though, this is pure youth crew straight edge, clearly
inspired by Youth of Today, Side by Side, Wide Awake, etc., and it's
as strong a take on that sound as you're going to find. I should also
mention that the packaging on this is extensive and awesome. The
jacket is on a very heavy stock, it comes with an obi strip, and (most
importantly) a very thick, full-color, 7"-size booklet that not only
reproduces the layout of the band's lone 7" EP, but also adds dozens
of great photographs that look like they were ripped straight from the
pages of Schism or Hardware. I'm not sure that, at the end of the day,
this is great music or anything, but if like me you only need to own a
handful of youth crew records this should be a strong contender for
being one of them.

Various: Maggot Minded cassette (Maggot Mind)
New pressing (I assume?) of this 2008 compilation featuring a number
of bands from Olympia, Seattle, and surrounding areas, including HIV,
Loose Change, Horrible, White Boss, Funerot, Sisters, and Sex/Vid.
Like a good regional tape comp should be, everything is raw,
straightforward, and to the point. Some of these bands went on to
bigger things and some didn't (obviously Sex/Vid is the standout band
here and indeed their tracks are the strongest), but I would hardly
describe the quality is uneven, and everything kind of has that weird,
slightly artsy vibe that Washington (particularly Olympia) bands
always seem to have. Maybe a curiosity, but releases like this are
really what hardcore and punk are all about.

Pusrad: Errare Est Humanum 12" (Dead Beat)
2nd 12" from this great Swedish band. I know that a lot of people
don't like Pusrad, and I guess that's understandable because their
sound is a little goofy. If you haven't heard them, the "gimmick" (if
you could call it that) is that the songs are VERY short (averaging
about 20 seconds) and are built around all of these super tight little
changes and stops and starts. It isn't particularly heavy, though, and
even though it's very fast it doesn't really sound like hardcore. It's
really sort of like an updated version of early Wire if they only did
songs like "Field Day for the Sundays" and "Surgeon's Girl." On the
surface it sounds like an incredibly limiting framework, but every
time a new Pusrad record comes out it astounds me how much they can do
within it. Listening to this is kind of exhausting because it goes by
fast, but there are so many great hooks that you can't help but play
the record over and over... I'm on my fourth or fifth consecutive
listen as I type this. I feel like every new Pusrad record has been
better than the last, and this continues that trend. Recommended.

Total Control: Typical System 12" (Iron Lung)
Man, this was one follow-up I was really nervous about hearing. Even
though I'd heard their early singles, Total Control's first LP still
seemed to come totally out of nowhere... the whole post-punk revival
was just starting to get off the ground and it seemed instantly to
raise the bar several notches. But then the single on Sub Pop was
good, but not really explosive, and in my opinion the songs on the
split 12" with the Oh Sees didn't really stick out that much either.
However, it's clear now that Total Control were saving themselves for
this record, because it's really incredible. The environment in 2014
is very different... everyone and their brother seems to have a
post-punk band, yet Total Control still feel miles ahead. The intro
track is a total scorcher, a blistering blast of Depeche
Mode-influenced electro pop that I think is easily the best track
they've done (particularly in this style) since "Paranoid Video." Over
the course of the LP the band moves so fluidly between so many
styles... krautrock, new wave, garage-punk, and the big closer "Safety
Net," which could almost be like U2 or something with its big,
triumphant melody. I've probably listened to this 30+ times since it
came out, and I don't see it getting old any time soon. A serious
contender for best LP of 2014, and needless to say it gets our highest
possible recommendation.

Ty Segall: Manipulator 2x12" (Drag City)
Sorry State has been carrying Ty Segall's records since back when we
couldn't give them away, and like a lot of people I always liked him a
lot but thought he was capable of just a little bit more. Well,
Manipulator is that more... reading the press leading up to this album
Segall talked a lot about how he took his time with this one and it
really shows. He used to bury his melodies in so much fuzz that it
took a lot of effort on the listener's part to pick them out (not to
mention the lofty task of wading through his huge discography), but on
this record everything is right up front, waiting to be loved.
Admittedly it's not as furious as some of his other stuff, but this
sort of rootsy glam sound (I'd compare it to records like Bowie's The
Man Who Sold the World or Lou Reed's Transformer) is such a great
framework for Segall and every song is a legit hit. This is a big
record and will likely be all over NPR, Pitchfork, etc. in the months
to come (and on those respective publications' year-end best-of lists
too, I'm sure), but it's legit enough for those of us in the
underground as well. Until he makes a better record, but position is
that this is the Ty Segall you want in your collection.

General Speech Omnibus Vol 2 zine
Latest "omnibus issue" that collects the best content from this
long-running fanzine. The content is really top-notch... the bands and
labels interviewed and profiled (including DiE, Criaturas, Discrete
Records, Terveet K=C3=A4det, Fracaso, and a big feature on current Mexican
punk) are almost all really interesting, and the interview questions
and general level of thought is much higher than your typical punk
fanzine. If you're a zine-lover this is pretty much a must-read.

Aborticido: S/T 7" (General Speech)
5-song 7" from this raw hardcore band out of Mexico. Actually,
there's one song title in Japanese and one in English in addition to
two in Spanish (and one in apparent nonsense?), so as you might expect
these guys seem to have a good handle on the worldwide hardcore
scene... this isn't some backwoods grindcore band or anything.
Interestingly, Aborticido seem to be inspired primarily by 80s
Japanese punk... they remind me of the noisier, harsher bands on the
ADK label, and the singer's kind of whiny, high-pitched scream
actually sounds a LOT like the vocalist of Aburadako, whose flexi is
one of my favorite Japanese records. Some of this record is total
blur-core, but they rock things out on the last track, "Esta Culero,"
and it's really almost a dead ringer for the Aburadako flexi... if you
want a less obscure reference it also sounds a bit like the Stalin.
Any way you cut it, though, this is a cool little EP with some rad
artwork. Limited to 250 copies.

Koward: Desperate 7" (Side Two)
Brand new 7" from this Boston band, and it's a ripper. I guess the
sound they're going for is the kind of straightforward, barreling,
Doom-inspired kind of thing, and they definitely have that going on
(and in that respect they actually sound a bit like Sorry State faves
No Tomorrow), but I think it's the other aspects of their sound that
really elevate Koward. The vocals are very hardcore... it sounds more
like the type of singing on like a Boston Strangler record or
something, and I can't overstate how great it is to hear a
crusty-sounding record without boring vocals. They also have a couple
of little musical tricks up their sleeve... a blazing guitar solo
here, a "Protest & Survive"-esque palm-muted part there... it's
definitely enough variation to keep this 7" snapping along.

Low Threat Profile: Product #3 7" (Six Weeks)
Latest EP from this band composed of power violence legends.
Interestingly, there isn't as much of that whiplash-inducing power
violence sound on this as you might expect... yes, it's very tight,
but in general the intricacy of the changes is de-emphasized here in
favor of a much more powerful, straightforward hardcore sound. Aside
from the obvious power violence parts, this just sounds like angry old
dude hardcore like Inmates or Out Cold or something like that. Who
knows if anyone outside the PV scene will give this a listen, but it's
a bruiser.

The Ukiah Drag: In the Reaper's Quarters 12" (Wharf Cat)
I'm really surprised no enterprising British music journalist has
named this little emerging scene of American indie/punk bands that
seems to coalescing at the moment. While there isn't really a cohesive
sound, there does seem to be something rather coherent in the
aesthetic of bands like Merchandise, Destruction Unit, Milk Music, the
Men, and Ukiah Drag (which, I guess, would make the definitive
document of this scene the recent 3-way split LP on 540 Records). Even
if they sound quite different, these bands share similar stories, with
members coming up through the DIY hardcore scene and growing to make
music that's a little bit more ambitious and refined. I guess that you
might distill it down to kids discovering their dad's Neil Young
records (something that's been going on at least since Dinosaur Jr),
but still there seems to be something unique about these bands, and at
moments they can make it feel like a genuinely exciting scene is
happening. Well, with this debut LP Ukiah Drag seem determined to take
their place at this table, bringing a sound that's equal parts the
Neil Young-isms of the later Men stuff, Merchandise's druggy haze, and
Destruction Unit's psychedelic forward lurch. However, the Ukiah
Drag's signature move seems to be the Gun Club-esque punk/blues vamp,
something that takes up a big part of the a-side of this LP and
definitely serves as a sort of sonic trademark. However, by the end of
the record you don't know what you're listening to anymore as it
devolves into the ambient hum of "Night of Immaculacy." This is an
ambitious, captivating LP, and I'm sure it'll be too "mature" or artsy
for some, but if you dig the aforementioned bands this definitely fits
into your scene for a reason.

The Gotobeds: Poor People Are Revolting 12" (12XU)
Debut 12" from this Pittsburgh band featuring former members of Kim
Phuc. Kim Phuc was a big, noisy, and nasty band, but Gotobeds are
something completely different. I figure they must be named after the
drummer from Wire, and indeed Wire seems like an obvious influence
here. The music is upbeat, bouncy, melodic, and built around a guitar
sound that's muscular but at the same time razor-thin and biting.
Really, though, what the Gotobeds remind me of are Parquet Courts...
like that band this kind of sounds like Pavement, Neu!, and Wire all
thrown into a blender, sprinkled with a heavy dose of modern
indie/punk sarcasm (see "New York's Alright if You Like Sex & Phones")
and wrapped up in an aesthetic that almost blatantly bites the Fall
circa Hex Enduction Hour and Room to Live. It remains to be seen if
this has the staying power of Parquet Courts' Light Up Gold, but right
now I'm enjoying this upbeat, melodic indie rock.

Good Throb: Live in WFMU cassette (Muscle Horse)
Live-on-the-radio set from the almighty Good Throb! When I listen to
this tape I think pretty much the same thing I thought when I was
watching them play live earlier this year, i.e. "I really wish they
just played every single song they've ever written." Still, though,
this is a pretty solid set with early favorites like "Bag," a couple
of the best LP songs like "Double White Denim" and "Acid House," and a
cover of "Tube Disasters" by Flux of Pink Indians that they played
live at several dates. Not as essential as their vinyl, obviously, but
I can't get enough of this band and the set is well-recorded and
powerful.

In case you didn't get our mid-month update, we have two new releases from =
Whatever Brains, who just put out their insanely great =
<i>SSR-63/SSR-64</i> double 12" EP, and No Love, who are coming at you =
with <i>Tape #2</i>. The Brains record is limited to 300 and the No Love =
tape is only 100, and both are well on their way to selling out, so I =
highly suggest grabbing these soon if you want them. Also, if you want to =
see them at your local record store tell them to get in touch with us soon =
before they run out! Oh, and speaking of Whatever Brains we still have all =
of their previous records on sale, so if you haven't picked those up do it =
now!<br><br>
In general webstore news, we just made it so that all domestic orders =
(i.e. those shipping within the US) get free shipping as long as you buy =
at least $60 worth of stuff. I may make this a permanent thing to =
encourage larger orders... not sure at the moment, but I'll keep this =
going for at least a week, so grab a big pile of cool stuff! You don't =
have to do anything... the free shipping will be included automatically at =
checkout.<br><br>
It feels like I've been talking forever about the upcoming releases, and =
since last month we've had some movement on some projects and no movement =
on others. It's looking like the Louder LP will be the first of the new =
batch of full-lengths to come out since that's the only one we have =
completed artwork for. However, we already have the jackets for the first =
volume of the North Carolina singles series, so as soon as we have the =
vinyl for the Davidians single we'll put that up for sale. In other =
singles series news, we're expecting test presses of the No Love single =
(the second volume in the series) in the next couple of days and I =
couldn't be more stoked. I realized the other day that I haven't played on =
an actual piece of vinyl since the Logic Problem LP 4 or 5 years =
ago.<br><br>
Aside from that we just keep plugging along here in Raleigh. We've been =
doing our best to keep the store stocked with sick used records (sorry, =
though, I had to take that minty copy of Youth Brigade's <i>Possible</i> =
EP home...) and the latest new jams.<br><br>

What's Up Sorry Staters?<br><br>
For distro stuff this month, even though September had a ton of new =
releases come through the door, I'm gonna stick to the bare essentials.
As far as hardcore is concerned, some absolute must-haves are the new DiE =
- Vexed 7" and Koward - Desperate 7"
-- two bands in punk that for my money are doing it the right way.
Also, for a different pace, I have to say that I am really into the new =
Total Control - Typical System LP.
Has the right blend post-punk, new wave, and krautrock, but really just =
boils down to good songs.<br><br>
In other news, it's good to see the new Sorry State releases slowly but =
surely showing up on the store's doorstep.
The new Whatever Brains is finally out, and I'm sure the other records SSR =
has had in the works will be on close on the heels of that.<br><br>
It's strange that I've been back from Skem&auml;ta tour for a while now =
and we're still waiting on the official press of our LP.
From what I understand, they should be here any time now.
We have a couple shows coming up in early-to-mid November, and hopefully =
we'll have the LPs by then.
One of those shows is with Forward and Long Knife, so that should be =
killer!
Also, I'll take this time to say that I am beyond excited to announce that =
Solar Funeral will also be releasing an EP with 3 new Skem&auml;ta songs =
in early 2015!<br><br>
I mentioned in a previous newsletter that two guys in Mercy Killings had =
some pretty serious medical issues.
Both of those dudes are back on their feet, so we'll probably be busy =
again pretty soon.
Beach Impediment will be dropping our second 7" at any time now, so keep =
an eye out!<br><br>
That all from me for now I think. Thanks for reading!<br><br>
-Jeff

Get the new Whatever Brains 12&rdquo;! I&rsquo;m sure Daniel has plenty to =
say about it in his section and he&rsquo;s better at describing things =
anyways. Like every new WB record it expands on their last one, going in a =
new direction but still keeping the essence of the Brains.<br><br>
We got the Juanita Y Los Feos LP back in stock! I wanted to write about =
this last month but by the time it came to the end of the month we were =
sold out. I have been listening to this LP obsessively. Super catchy =
vocals and melodies, synth but not going overboard with it, and just an =
overall good flow with the whole LP. The overall album has a dark =
atmosphere but with a pop attitude. You can go over to La Vida Es Un =
Mus&rsquo; bandcamp and check it out (i suggest listening to Revolucion =
Canibal).
We also got the Primetime 7&rdquo; (also on La Vida Es Un Mus) back in. =
Tied down is one of the best songs, very Delta 5 sounding. If you like any =
of the stuff coming out of london right now then you&rsquo;ll be into =
this.<br><br>
The new King Tuff album has been on a lot at the shop the past couple =
days. Headbanger is definitely the hit for me. It&rsquo;s one of those =
songs that finishes and you want to just start over. If you were a fan of =
his last album then you&rsquo;ll definitely like this one.<br><br>
TOTAL CONTROL! If you haven&rsquo;t heard their new LP do yourself a favor =
and just buy it. It&rsquo;s an amazing record from beginning to end. It =
still has a gloomy feel to it but with a clearer production. It bounces =
around between genres while still just sounding like Total Control. =
I&rsquo;m pretty sure everyone at the store has been listening to this =
record non-stop.<br><br>
Other awesome new records: Ukiah Drag LP, Poison Girls - Hex, The =
Wipers-Nome Noma 7&rdquo;, Die-Vexed 7&rdquo;, Gorilla - Mary Anne =
7&rdquo;, Hurula LP, and of course TEENGENERATE! Oh yeah also maybe the =
new No Love Tape if you&rsquo;re into that.
<br><br>

Seth did a pretty good job of covering the bases for the essential =
releases of the month, but I'll say that September was one of the =
strongest months for new releases all year... I'm sure you're bound to see =
the DiE 7", the Glue 7", and the Total Control LP on a number of year-end =
lists, and for good reason... they're all incredible records that you =
pretty much need to own if you're the kind of person who reads these =
updates.<br><br>
I'll also agree with Seth that the restocks from La Vida Es Un Mus are =
essential... I still haven't grown tired of the Juanita Y Los Feos LP or =
the Prime Time 7".<br><br>
One record that Seth didn't mention is the new Pusrad 12" on Dead Beat. =
You may think that you have Pusrad pretty much figured out by now, and =
it's not like they stopped writing short songs or anything, but this new =
record really steps things up. It actually deserves a Wire comparison not =
just because the songs are so short, but also because they're really, =
really good and memorable. I don't think I ever listen to the record fewer =
than 3 times in a row when I put it on.<br><br>
I feel like there are a lot fewer descriptions this month because I've =
been so stretched for time, but that also means that only the best =
releases have been graced with my wordsmithery, so I'll stop writing here =
so you can check it out below!<br><br>

Pig DNA: <i>Control You Fucker #3</i> 7" (Night Rider)<br>
After a couple of well-regarded demo tapes we finally get a slab of vinyl =
from this noisy Bay Area hardcore band. This kind of balls-to-wall, =
nearly-abstract noise punk doesn't really seem to be as in vogue as it was =
a couple of years ago, and I'm not sure if that's why Pig DNA sound so =
fresh or if it's just that they're really, really good at it. The guitars =
are definitely informed by the Kyushu classics (as well as newer stuff =
like Lebenden Toten) as this is a total noise attack with a weird kind of =
drifting phase effect over all of the guitars. I think what makes Pig DNA =
different, though, is that this layer of noise gets put down on a =
foundation of well-written hardcore songs. The vocalist actually reminds =
me a little of Jordan from Dark Ages, and the rhythm section definitely =
has the same kind of snappy hardcore attack, but then there are those =
total wall of noise guitars... if all of the Confuse-worshipping "myspace =
crust" bands of a few years ago didn't wear you out on this style of =
noisecore this is one you'll want to check out as it's definitely a cut =
above.<br><br>

No Love: <i>Tape #2</i> cassette (Sorry State)<br>
After an earlier self-released demo, Raleigh, North Carolina&rsquo;s No =
Love move to Sorry State proper for their second release. Dispensing with =
some of the poppier tendencies of their demo, No Love play fist-pumping =
melodic punk along the lines of the Buzzcocks, the Avengers, and the =
Canadian Subhumans, occasionally augmented with the sarcastic snap of =
bands like the Angry Samoans. Tape #2 contains four new tracks recorded by =
Colin Swanson-White (Davidians), and the new recording does a much better =
job of capturing the band&rsquo;s dense combination of melodic bass lines, =
dueling lead guitar and anthemic vocals. Cassettes are professionally =
duplicated and come with a digital download. Limited to 100 =
copies.<br><br>

Whatever Brains: <i>SSR-63/SSR-64</i> 2x12" EP (Sorry State)<br>
Whatever Brains have always been a band inclined toward the grand =
statement, but their latest release reaches new levels of epic. Not a =
conventional LP or a double LP, SSR-63/SSR-64 is actually two separate EPs =
packaged as one. SSR-63 is a single 22-minute track spread across both =
sides of a 45RPM 12". A series of linked compositions a la Venom&rsquo;s =
<i>At War with Satan</i> or the Subhumans&rsquo; <i>From the Cradle to the =
Grave</i>, SSR-63&rsquo;s lyrics chronicle the plight of a Russian family =
who lived in complete isolation in remote Siberia for more than 40 years. =
The music is similarly wide in scope, drifting organically from maximalist =
punk to minimalist, country-tinged lament to pumping electronica in an =
astoundingly natural fashion. As for the other 12&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s a new =
4-song EP called SSR-64, which continues to develop the wide sonic palette =
that the best tracks on their previous LP hinted at. SSR-64 also delivers =
&ldquo;UVOD,&rdquo; the closest thing to a pop hit Whatever Brains have =
ever created. As ever, a good portion of the people reading this will be =
confused and repulsed by the Whatever Brains, while the remainder will =
insist vocally that this is one of the most truly innovative and exciting =
records of 2014.<br><br>
I should also mention the physical characteristics of this release, =
because it&rsquo;s one that you&rsquo;re definitely going to want to own =
on vinyl. First of all, we put a lot of effort (and money) into mastering =
for this release, and the result is easily the best-sounding =
(fidelity-wise, at least) record that Sorry State has ever produced. Since =
we splurged on the sonics, we&rsquo;ve done our best to keep the price of =
this thing low with screen printed jackets made from recycled materials. =
In a world of tossed-off, insta-file releases, holding SSR-63/SSR-64 in =
your hands will make you realize why you still care about vinyl.<br><br>

DiE: <i>Vexed</i> 7" (Sonic Terror)<br>
Second EP from the almighty DiE, to my mind the best hardcore band going =
in the UK right now, though they definitely have some competition from =
bands like the Flex, Perspex Flesh, Violent Reaction, and Arms Race. =
Anyway, everyone flipped out over this band's first EP, and with good =
reason... it's straight up one of the best hardcore records in recent =
memory. Things have changed just a little bit for the second EP... while =
there are some definite hardcore stompers here (quite a few, in fact), it =
feels like the balance has tilted slightly toward a more frantic, kind of =
unhinged sound. There's a lot more lead guitar on this one, and the songs =
are generally shorter, faster, and more to the point. The band's main =
selling point, though--those insanely powerful vocals--are back in full =
force, and even the fastest tracks have a singalong quality that very, =
very few bands can successfully emulate. In other words, this is just =
similar enough that everyone who loved their first EP that will love it, =
but just different enough so that it doesn't feel like more of the same. =
Utterly essential.<br><br>

Gorilla: <i>Mary Anne</i> 7" (Three Dimensional)<br>
Two-song 45 of full-on power pop worship from this Japanese band. Everyone =
knows that the Japanese are the absolute best when it comes to retro =
culture, and this single is as spot-on as you would expect. If you dig the =
type of thing that Sing Sing generally reissues, or just power-pop in the =
Big Star / Paul Collins / Nerves / Exploding Hearts tradition this will be =
right up your alley... total Rickenbacker rock.<br><br>

Secta Suicida: S/T 7" (MMM)<br>
Debut 7" from this killer new band out of Bogota, Colombia, released on =
MMM, Josh from Ruleta Rusa's label. It's easy to see why this caught =
Josh's ear, as it's almost strikingly similar in places... like Ruleta =
Rusa (as well as the singer's old band, Peligro Social), Secta Suicida =
perfectly combine the old melodic Spanish punk sound exemplified by =
Eskorbuto with the energy of hardcore. Basically, if you like Ruleta Rusa =
or Peligro Social you should get this, because these four catchy hardcore =
punk songs are absolutely top-notch.<br><br>

Hurula: S/T 12" (No Good)<br>
While I really wish he would spend his time bugging Marcus to do more =
Inst&auml;ngd releases, it's good to see that Robert from the Vicious / =
Masshysteri is back at it. His new band Hurula pretty much picks up where =
the last Masshysteri record left off, perhaps moving even more in a pop =
direction. Honestly, I think this sound suits him a lot better... I think =
Masshysteri's last record was their best one, and it's good to hear him =
push the music further with more complex instrumentation and arrangements =
rather than being tied down to having to be "punk." Not that this isn't =
punk... it's still loud, but the pop sensibility is at the forefront. At =
any rate, if you were a Masshysteri fan you'll definitely want to pick =
this up. Note: this is the European pressing on No Good Records.<br><br>

Video: <i>Cult of Video</i> 7" (No Good)<br>
Brand new single from this Texas band, released on German label and likely =
kind of difficult to find in the US. These guys immediately came out of =
the gate with an utterly distinctive sound that had the energy of =
hardcore, the melody of the best garage/punk bands, and a new =
wave/post-punk informed sense of dynamism. On their recent 7" on Total =
Punk as well as this new single they evolve very slightly, laying down a =
bit heavier on the psych-informed guitar freakout, but basically if you =
dug the pumping, driving, and catchy punk that appeared on their other =
releases this is no less essential. I still think they kind of sound like =
the Adolescents and, still, no one really agrees with me, but if you like =
catchy, energetic punk in that style this is definitely a band you want to =
check out.<br><br>

Genocide Pact: <i>Desecration</i> 7" (Bad Teeth)<br>
Debut 7" from this Washington, DC death metal band featuring Connor from =
Protester on drums. I'm often wary of hardcore kids playing metal, but =
this is pretty legit death metal... you won't find any real trace of =
hardcore influence, just straight up gnarly metal. The production is =
clear, powerful, and heavy in line with the great Florida bands of the =
late 80s and early 90s, and the songwriting and riffing is top-notch as =
well. It's not as overtly catchy as, say, Death's early stuff, but fans of =
Obituary and the like will dig this hard... definitely one I'd recommend =
for you metalheads out there.<br><br>

Wipers: <i>Nome Noma</i> 7" (Meanbean)<br>
Not to be confused with the much more famous Portland band of the same =
name, Meanbean Records' debut release is a reissue of the 1980 single by =
this obscure Toronto punk band. I hadn't heard of this before the reissue, =
which is surprising because this is a top-notch early punk record from a =
city with a well-known scene. Maybe it was that this record was a bit =
behind the times... by 1980 the original '77 punk scene that this single =
owes its clearest sonic debt to was dying out and making way for hardcore, =
of which you'll find none here. However, if your idea of punk is bands =
like Teenage Head, the Pointed Sticks, Lost Kids, Buzzcocks, etc., these =
two tracks will hit your sweet spot. Definitely recommended for all of you =
'77 punk / KBD heads out there.<br><br>

Nightfell: <i>The Ever Living Mourn</i> 12" (Southern Lord)<br>
Debut LP from this new Portland project featuring Todd from Tragedy / His =
Hero Is Gone and Tim from Aldebaran/Mournful Congregation. If I had to =
choose one adjective to describe this record it would certainly be BLEAK. =
While I'm sure Tragedy fans can get down with this... after all, Todd's =
songwriting style is definitely apparent and there's something of =
Tragedy's epic sweep in nearly every track here, but it's sort of like =
they took away all of the catchier, more anthemic aspects of Tragedy and =
left all of the bleak dirginess. It's definitely more metal, leaning =
toward a kind of blackened doom sound, but there's a lot of Hellhammer's =
primitive, almost punk take on metal as well. Apparently this project came =
out of the members dealing with a bunch of tragedy and loss, and that =
definitely comes across in the music... it's the kind of record you listen =
to alone, in the dark, when you're pondering how much life sucks.<br><br>

Brotherhood: <i>Till Death</i> 12" (Southern Lord)<br>
So this was a bit of a surprise... I know that Southern Lord has been =
re-releasing a bunch of 80s hardcore over the past few years, but I didn't =
expect them to start mining the well of late 80s straight edge / youth =
crew obscurities. However, Southern Lord owner / Sunn O))) guitarist Greg =
Anderson was the guitarist in Brotherhood, so I guess it makes sense =
(though he isn't even the most famous Brotherhood alumnus... bassist Nate =
Mendel went on to play in Foo Fighters(!)). Anyway, I remember owning the =
old Crucial Response version of this LP back in the day and sold it in a =
purge of nearly all of my old youth crew records, but revisiting this =
years down the line it's actually way more ripping than I remember. It's =
definitely of its time and isn't really breaking the mold in any way, but =
it's a concise, well-recorded, and powerful document of the sound and =
style. At their best Brotherhood could approach the stop/start intensity =
of Straight Ahead (as they do on the classic first track, "The Deal"), and =
they also have a bit common with the post-Youth of Today generation of =
NYHC / CBGB bands... bands like Breakdown, Outburst, Sick of It All, etc. =
At its core, though, this is pure youth crew straight edge, clearly =
inspired by Youth of Today, Side by Side, Wide Awake, etc., and it's as =
strong a take on that sound as you're going to find. I should also mention =
that the packaging on this is extensive and awesome. The jacket is on a =
very heavy stock, it comes with an obi strip, and (most importantly) a =
very thick, full-color, 7"-size booklet that not only reproduces the =
layout of the band's lone 7" EP, but also adds dozens of great photographs =
that look like they were ripped straight from the pages of <i>Schism</i> =
or <i>Hardware</i>. I'm not sure that, at the end of the day, this is =
great music or anything, but if like me you only need to own a handful of =
youth crew records this should be a strong contender for being one of =
them.<br><br>

Various: <i>Maggot Minded</i> cassette (Maggot Mind)<br>
New pressing (I assume?) of this 2008 compilation featuring a number of =
bands from Olympia, Seattle, and surrounding areas, including HIV, Loose =
Change, Horrible, White Boss, Funerot, Sisters, and Sex/Vid. Like a good =
regional tape comp should be, everything is raw, straightforward, and to =
the point. Some of these bands went on to bigger things and some didn't =
(obviously Sex/Vid is the standout band here and indeed their tracks are =
the strongest), but I would hardly describe the quality is uneven, and =
everything kind of has that weird, slightly artsy vibe that Washington =
(particularly Olympia) bands always seem to have. Maybe a curiosity, but =
releases like this are really what hardcore and punk are all =
about.<br><br>

Pusrad: <i>Errare Est Humanum</i> 12" (Dead Beat)<br>
2nd 12" from this great Swedish band. I know that a lot of people don't =
like Pusrad, and I guess that's understandable because their sound is a =
little goofy. If you haven't heard them, the "gimmick" (if you could call =
it that) is that the songs are VERY short (averaging about 20 seconds) and =
are built around all of these super tight little changes and stops and =
starts. It isn't particularly heavy, though, and even though it's very =
fast it doesn't really sound like hardcore. It's really sort of like an =
updated version of early Wire if they only did songs like "Field Day for =
the Sundays" and "Surgeon's Girl." On the surface it sounds like an =
incredibly limiting framework, but every time a new Pusrad record comes =
out it astounds me how much they can do within it. Listening to this is =
kind of exhausting because it goes by fast, but there are so many great =
hooks that you can't help but play the record over and over... I'm on my =
fourth or fifth consecutive listen as I type this. I feel like every new =
Pusrad record has been better than the last, and this continues that =
trend. Recommended.<br><br>

Total Control: <i>Typical System</i> 12" (Iron Lung)<br>
Man, this was one follow-up I was really nervous about hearing. Even =
though I'd heard their early singles, Total Control's first LP still =
seemed to come totally out of nowhere... the whole post-punk revival was =
just starting to get off the ground and it seemed instantly to raise the =
bar several notches. But then the single on Sub Pop was good, but not =
really explosive, and in my opinion the songs on the split 12" with the Oh =
Sees didn't really stick out that much either. However, it's clear now =
that Total Control were saving themselves for this record, because it's =
really incredible. The environment in 2014 is very different... everyone =
and their brother seems to have a post-punk band, yet Total Control still =
feel miles ahead. The intro track is a total scorcher, a blistering blast =
of Depeche Mode-influenced electro pop that I think is easily the best =
track they've done (particularly in this style) since "Paranoid Video." =
Over the course of the LP the band moves so fluidly between so many =
styles... krautrock, new wave, garage-punk, and the big closer "Safety =
Net," which could almost be like U2 or something with its big, triumphant =
melody. I've probably listened to this 30+ times since it came out, and I =
don't see it getting old any time soon. A serious contender for best LP of =
2014, and needless to say it gets our highest possible =
recommendation.<br><br>

Ty Segall: <i>Manipulator</i> 2x12" (Drag City)<br>
Sorry State has been carrying Ty Segall's records since back when we =
couldn't give them away, and like a lot of people I always liked him a lot =
but thought he was capable of just a little bit more. Well, =
<i>Manipulator</i> is that more... reading the press leading up to this =
album Segall talked a lot about how he took his time with this one and it =
really shows. He used to bury his melodies in so much fuzz that it took a =
lot of effort on the listener's part to pick them out (not to mention the =
lofty task of wading through his huge discography), but on this record =
everything is right up front, waiting to be loved. Admittedly it's not as =
furious as some of his other stuff, but this sort of rootsy glam sound =
(I'd compare it to records like Bowie's <i>The Man Who Sold the World</i> =
or Lou Reed's <i>Transformer</i>) is such a great framework for Segall and =
every song is a legit hit. This is a big record and will likely be all =
over NPR, Pitchfork, etc. in the months to come (and on those respective =
publications' year-end best-of lists too, I'm sure), but it's legit enough =
for those of us in the underground as well. Until he makes a better =
record, but position is that this is the Ty Segall you want in your =
collection.<br><br>

Aborticido: S/T 7" (General Speech)<br>
5-song 7" from this raw hardcore band out of Mexico. Actually, there's one =
song title in Japanese and one in English in addition to two in Spanish =
(and one in apparent nonsense?), so as you might expect these guys seem to =
have a good handle on the worldwide hardcore scene... this isn't some =
backwoods grindcore band or anything. Interestingly, Aborticido seem to be =
inspired primarily by 80s Japanese punk... they remind me of the noisier, =
harsher bands on the ADK label, and the singer's kind of whiny, =
high-pitched scream actually sounds a LOT like the vocalist of Aburadako, =
whose flexi is one of my favorite Japanese records. Some of this record is =
total blur-core, but they rock things out on the last track, "Esta =
Culero," and it's really almost a dead ringer for the Aburadako flexi... =
if you want a less obscure reference it also sounds a bit like the Stalin. =
Any way you cut it, though, this is a cool little EP with some rad =
artwork. Limited to 250 copies.<br><br>

Koward: <i>Desperate</i> 7" (Side Two)<br>
Brand new 7" from this Boston band, and it's a ripper. I guess the sound =
they're going for is the kind of straightforward, barreling, Doom-inspired =
kind of thing, and they definitely have that going on (and in that respect =
they actually sound a bit like Sorry State faves No Tomorrow), but I think =
it's the other aspects of their sound that really elevate Koward. The =
vocals are very hardcore... it sounds more like the type of singing on =
like a Boston Strangler record or something, and I can't overstate how =
great it is to hear a crusty-sounding record without boring vocals. They =
also have a couple of little musical tricks up their sleeve... a blazing =
guitar solo here, a "Protest & Survive"-esque palm-muted part there... =
it's definitely enough variation to keep this 7" snapping along.<br><br>

violence sound on this as you might expect... yes, it's very tight, but in =
general the intricacy of the changes is de-emphasized here in favor of a =
much more powerful, straightforward hardcore sound. Aside from the obvious =
power violence parts, this just sounds like angry old dude hardcore like =
Inmates or Out Cold or something like that. Who knows if anyone outside =
the PV scene will give this a listen, but it's a bruiser.<br><br>

The Ukiah Drag: <i>In the Reaper's Quarters</i> 12" (Wharf Cat)<br>
I'm really surprised no enterprising British music journalist has named =
this little emerging scene of American indie/punk bands that seems to =
coalescing at the moment. While there isn't really a cohesive sound, there =
does seem to be something rather coherent in the aesthetic of bands like =
Merchandise, Destruction Unit, Milk Music, the Men, and Ukiah Drag (which, =
I guess, would make the definitive document of this scene the recent 3-way =
split LP on 540 Records). Even if they sound quite different, these bands =
share similar stories, with members coming up through the DIY hardcore =
scene and growing to make music that's a little bit more ambitious and =
refined. I guess that you might distill it down to kids discovering their =
dad's Neil Young records (something that's been going on at least since =
Dinosaur Jr), but still there seems to be something unique about these =
bands, and at moments they can make it feel like a genuinely exciting =
scene is happening. Well, with this debut LP Ukiah Drag seem determined to =
take their place at this table, bringing a sound that's equal parts the =
Neil Young-isms of the later Men stuff, Merchandise's druggy haze, and =
Destruction Unit's psychedelic forward lurch. However, the Ukiah Drag's =
signature move seems to be the Gun Club-esque punk/blues vamp, something =
that takes up a big part of the a-side of this LP and definitely serves as =
a sort of sonic trademark. However, by the end of the record you don't =
know what you're listening to anymore as it devolves into the ambient hum =
of "Night of Immaculacy." This is an ambitious, captivating LP, and I'm =
sure it'll be too "mature" or artsy for some, but if you dig the =
aforementioned bands this definitely fits into your scene for a =
reason.<br><br>

The Gotobeds: <i>Poor People Are Revolting</i> 12" (12XU)<br>
Debut 12" from this Pittsburgh band featuring former members of Kim Phuc. =
Kim Phuc was a big, noisy, and nasty band, but Gotobeds are something =
completely different. I figure they must be named after the drummer from =
Wire, and indeed Wire seems like an obvious influence here. The music is =
upbeat, bouncy, melodic, and built around a guitar sound that's muscular =
but at the same time razor-thin and biting. Really, though, what the =
Gotobeds remind me of are Parquet Courts... like that band this kind of =
sounds like Pavement, Neu!, and Wire all thrown into a blender, sprinkled =
with a heavy dose of modern indie/punk sarcasm (see "New York's Alright if =
You Like Sex & Phones") and wrapped up in an aesthetic that almost =
blatantly bites the Fall circa <i>Hex Enduction Hour</i> and <i>Room to =
Live</i>. It remains to be seen if this has the staying power of Parquet =
Courts' <i>Light Up Gold</i>, but right now I'm enjoying this upbeat, =
melodic indie rock.<br><br>

Good Throb: <i>Live in WFMU</i> cassette (Muscle Horse)<br>
Live-on-the-radio set from the almighty Good Throb! When I listen to this =
tape I think pretty much the same thing I thought when I was watching them =
play live earlier this year, i.e. "I really wish they just played every =
single song they've ever written." Still, though, this is a pretty solid =
set with early favorites like "Bag," a couple of the best LP songs like =
"Double White Denim" and "Acid House," and a cover of "Tube Disasters" by =
Flux of Pink Indians that they played live at several dates. Not as =
essential as their vinyl, obviously, but I can't get enough of this band =
and the set is well-recorded and powerful.<br><br>
