$1250 per month, Red Hook, 1200 sf, creative & sunny artist loft
Available: June 15 through ?
1) THE PLACE
It's a 1200 sf loft on the top floor of an old factory building in  amazing=
 Red=20
Hook; 17' ceilings and a full height window wall with a view  of the harbor=
 and=20
Manhattan & Brooklyn skylines. Old refinished  wood floors, simple modern k=
itchen
and bathroom. There are two 160 sf  bedrooms tucked in the mezzanine floor =
overlooking
the main space -- I'm  in one, and the other is available beginning in mid-=
June.
 The loft is  something of a work in progress, improving bit by bit. It's a=
 pretty
 non-traditional setup -- there's an industrial ladder on wheels to  access=
 the=20
bedrooms, a hammock, hanging bicycles & a pretty massive  coffee table made=
 out=20
of a steel fire door, among other things. One wall  is for projecting films=
, and
 there's plenty of room for sprawling and  staring at the city. The buildin=
g's fantastic
as well - a big complex  full of artists and musicians and designers with a=
 courtyard
for  barbecues & gardening & drinking to boot. There's wireless  internet a=
nd a=20
laundry room on the floor. Red Hook is weird and  wonderful, still mostly o=
ff the
beaten track and all the better for it,  in my view the most interesting pi=
ece of
Brooklyn by far. Great bars,  great food, great creative energy -- everythi=
ng gets
made here, from  coffee to whiskey to furniture to flying bicycles. The bui=
lding's
on  Coffey Park, a block away from Van Brunt Street, the main thoroughfare =
 of Red
Hook, lined with bars, restaurants, galleries and artisan shops.  At its en=
d is=20
Fairway (giant grocery heaven), the piers (new york's only  frontal view of=
 the=20
statue of liberty), the NY Water Taxi (free weekend  boatrides to Manhattan=
) and
 Steve's Key Lime Pies (!). In the other  direction it's a 10 minute walk o=
ver the
newly opened pedestrian bridge  to the F / G subway at Carroll St, which is=
 10-15
minutes from downtown  Manhattan / LES and 15-20 minutes from Union Square =
/ Chelsea.
2) THE ROOM
The bedroom offered doesn't have a door or a lock - like my bedroom,  it's =
enclosed
by walls on three sides and has a thick sound-blanket on  the front overloo=
king=20
the main space. So while I'm a pretty respectful  dude, if you need total s=
ilence
and privacy the room might not be for  you -- if you're a loft-liver or lig=
ht-lover
it might be. The room's  clean and furnished with a single full size mattre=
ss, sheets,
thick  fluffy comforter thing, pillows and towels. There are lights and ple=
nty =20
of outlets in the room, and shelves and a clothesrack for storage.
3) THE PEOPLE
I'm an architect and builder; I work in Manhattan weekdays and at my  shop =
in Williamsburg
some portion of most weekends, though I mostly hang  out in Red Hook otherw=
ise.=20
Sometimes out late, sometimes not. I  generally have some projects going on=
 - I'm
always making stuff for the  loft, and I work on bikes on the side, so ther=
e's some
occasional  messiness, but I usually like to keep things organized if I'm n=
ot in
 the  midst of anything. I do believe I'm pretty easy to get along with, bu=
t  it
 is very much a shared space, so it's important I guess to feel it  out.
4) THE SITUATION
My current roommate's moving back to Berlin on June 13 or so, and I'm  aimi=
ng to
 rent the room on a part time basis. I haven't really decided  what I'm goi=
ng to
 do in the long term with the space, but I'd definitely  like to share it f=
or the
remainder of June and maybe July.  Unfortunately I've a lot of things up in=
 the=20
air, & can't commit to  more than a month right now -- but I reckon it migh=
t be=20
perfect for  someone who wants a bit of flexible time to look for a real le=
ase,=20
or  who's interested in checking out the neighborhood, or who just doesn't =
 have
 a set schedule yet. I'm more than open to renting weekly.
Rent's $1250/mo, or $350/wk, + 1/2 utilities pro-rated -- usually  internet=
 + elec
+ gas is around $120/mo, or $30/wk, divided between the  two of us.

$1300 per month, Harlem, 150 sqft, Modern Master Bedroom
Available: August 1 through TBD
Hi, I am a bit of a regular on Stephanie's list, and have always been  than=
kful=20
for the wonderful people her project has sent me to rent my  lovely furnish=
ed apartment.
For this time around I will be going away for 8 weeks to Boston for a  resi=
dency
 and am looking for a quiet, clean and respectful roommate for a  short ter=
m sublet
that has the potential to become a longer term  rental.
From June 11 - 29 I will be renting out my furnished bedroom at $65 a  day.=
 It is
the smaller bedroom of a real 800 sq ft two bedroom apartment  in a brand n=
ew elevator
building. The larger master bedroom is  currently being rented by a young a=
ctress
from Spain until June 29.  After she leaves the, the larger room will be av=
ailable
until July 3  after which the whole place will be full until August 1.
After August 1st I am looking for new roommates to rent both the smaller  r=
oom until
August 11 and the larger master bedroom for long term at  $1,300 a month.
Ok, so I know this sounds rather complicated, but if you are intrigued  let=
s start
a conversation to see what we can work out. You can read some  great review=
s of=20
my place through airbnb at  https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17716
The rent includes all utilities and internet, shared bathroom and a  fully =
stocked
kitchen (tend to try to keep it close to vegetarian with  just chicken or f=
ish.)
 Both rooms are furnished with a bed, chairs,  storage shelves, a closet, s=
heets,
towels and blankets. My smaller room  has a murphy bed that can be raised t=
o allow
space for working at a desk  or practicing yoga. The Master bedroom has a b=
ed that
can fold up into a  couch, a desk, a few smaller tables and a wonderful ant=
ique=20
dining  table for eating in.
While I am away the living room will be available to share with a dining  t=
able,
 desks and couch. When I return in August I use the living room  as my offi=
ce/studio
when I work at home.
I am on the second floor facing north on a quiet residential street with  t=
ree top
views, AC, WiFi, hard wood floors and good clean neighbors,  very safe. Ala=
s there
is no laundry in the building, but plenty of  Laundromats around the corner=
, as=20
well as 2 major subway stops, nice  supermarket and lots of cool restaurant=
s and
 bars nearby. The best part  is only being 2 blocks north of Central Park!

$1000 per month, Upper West Side, 250 sq ft, Charming 13 ft ceiling room
Available: now through open
$980 spacious room in historical building, 7 min to columbia,ccny,msm (Uppe=
r West
Side)
I am renting an amazing 250 sq ft room with 13 foot high ceiling and one  5=
' x 10'
window that provides immense natural lighting in early 20th  century public=
 school
building w/ a modern elevator,
furnished room and wooden floors. The space is perfect for artists that nee=
d creative
space Ideal for students as well.
The commute is easy. The building sits directly above the 125th ADBC  expre=
ss subway
station. The subway entrance is 50 feet from the front  door. The A and D t=
rains
 run express - Columbus Circle / Central Park: 6  minutes / Times Square: 8=
 mins
 / 34th St: 10 mins / West Village-NYU:  16 minutes / LES: 20 mins. Columbi=
a, Manhattan
School of Music and City  College are a short walk.
The modern kitchen and bath are shared with two other large rooms in the  a=
partment.
You share those with one male, late 20's Columbia student,  very respectful=
 and=20
easy to live with. There is no living room common  area.
The building has tons of character, with preserved ironwork and  moldings, =
but underwent
a complete renovation in the mid 90's, so there  is a modern elevator, digi=
tal security
doors, laundry in the building.  There is an AC unit as well in the room.
This is not a chilly luxury doorman building, however. There is a  familiar=
 sense
of community amongst the people in the building, mostly  professionals and =
artists.
I feel it's best suited for anyone seeking  that old New York bohemian spir=
it. But
if you have a problem with  mixed-race urban communities, you probably shou=
ld pass
this by.
This is a long term sublet preferably, but will consider short term as well=
. Thank
you!

ROOMS FOR SUBLET

$900 per month, Bushwick, 750 sq ft apt, bedroom is 110 sq ft, Spacious,  b=
eautiful
3 bedroom with exposed brick, large common area.
Available: May 23 through August or full year
I am a graduate student in the art department at Hunter College looking  to=
 sublet
my room for the summer while I'm out of town (June and July).  However, if =
you are
looking for something more permanent, my roommate is  moving out the same t=
ime I
 return so we will be looking for someone to  sublet long term after that. =
The only
difference is it is furnished  until August, unfurnished after August (and =
you can
change rooms or keep  the same and I'll move into his room).
The apartment is large and attractive, with a living/dining room area,  exp=
osed=20
brick walls and hardwood floors. The kitchen has granite  countertops and a=
 dishwasher.
The building was renovated about three  years ago and is on a nice resident=
ial street
in Bushwick. It is walking  distance from many galleries and restaurants an=
d the
 neighborhood is  growing as an arts district, but still affordable and saf=
e.
We have one cat until August, after which there will not be any pets in  th=
e apartment.
If you have an animal, it's negotiable, but we are happy  to keep the apart=
ment=20
pet free as well.
We're looking for someone who is laid back, responsible and respectful  of =
common
areas. The rent includes all utilities and internet. Your  roommates from J=
une to
August would be two males, and after August one  male and me.

Available: 6/1/2013 through next few months
Hello,
I'm subletting a room with an office in my apartment in Clinton Hill/Bed  S=
tuy 5
 minutes to Bedford-Nostrand G train stop. The apartment gets  lots of sun =
light
 and there's a backyard and basement for storage. There  are plenty of grea=
t places
to get food and coffee in the hood, and tons  of stuff on Myrtle ave and ab=
out 15
minute walk to the heart of Clinton  Hill.
I'm looking for a steadily employed woman or man late 20s-early 30s to  sha=
re this
place for the next few months. When I move out of the  apartment you could =
very=20
well take over the lease. About me: I'm 35 year  old male, work in media in=
 midtown
Manhattan, quiet, respectful, and  try to keep a clean place. If you're a r=
easonable
human being, not into  drugs, steadily employed, please message me.
To move in you'll need first month and security.
Depending on how long you'd like to stay and if we're compatible, it is  po=
ssible
to throw up a wall in the living so that the living room is  turned into a =
new bedroom
for you. There is also a space that can  function as an office. Once you st=

Available: June 7th through 1 - 3 months, Flexible
Available from June 7, end date is flexible! I am looking for someone to  s=
tay between
1 and 3 months, with the option to stay longer. Monthly  rent would be 1600=

e kitchen
and small living room in apartment. Tidy  and clean bathroom, and plenty of=

New Paltz/Woodstock area, $1000 per month, Catskill Mountains, upstate  New=
 York,
1200 SF 3 BR surrounded by forest and stream, Amazing  opportunity to share=
 house
in the country with mostly absent artist  owner
Available: June 1, 2013 through open
Nestled in the Catskill Mountains just 2 hrs north of the GWB, an oasis  of=
 quiet,
fresh air and wild life. Ideal for artists, writers and other  creative peo=
ple who
want to focus on their projects without the usual  distractions. 1200 sf 3 =
BR house
with detached workshop gives ample  space for your craft and your mind. Lar=
ge living
room with open kitchen,  tastefully decorated with art and Tibetan rugs, pl=
us art/work
space,  your bedroom and full bathroom downstairs. My bedroom and guest bed=
room=20
 upstairs. This cozy 2 story house with cathedral ceilings, 1.5 bath, and  =
a great
wood stove that keeps the house comfortable during the cold  months, looks =
out on
a meandering stream that crosses the property.
This rental is intended for a single person, but I am open to discussing th=
e possibility
of sharing with a couple.
We can discuss what would be the best arrangement for both of us. One  opti=
on could
be where you basically have the house all to yourself,  except for two week=
ends=20
a month when I will use the house exclusively.  That obviously would not wo=
rk if
 you are planning to move into the house  full-time. Unless you can be flex=
ible=20
about these two weekends. Another  option could be where on average 6 days =
a week
you have the place all  to your self. I would come up from NYC about once a=
 week
 to stay for a  day ( 2 nights usually). Holidays can be discussed.
If you can be okay with any of the above arrangements, this might be a  gre=
at deal
for you. I prefer more prolonged commitments (6+ months ) but  will conside=
r shorter
rentals. Non-smokers only. You can check the  house out - and for more pict=
ures=20
- by visiting the somewhat dated house  website www.catskillrentalhouse.com
I am planning to install a washer/dryer in the next 6 months. And a  bathho=
use with
sauna-room next to the stream in the next 12 months or  so.
If you're wondering what kind of art I'm involved with you can see and  hea=
r some
of that on my website: www.marcelvanrootselaar.com
Rent $1000/month plus utilities. $2500 security deposit plus references.
Local Transportation: Buses to New Paltz or Kingston, local cab. Or drive u=
p yourself
Looking forward to hear from you.

 (one
 would take the bed, the other the air mattress).
We need a security deposit of $500, which is fully refundable if nothing is=
 damaged
or left dirty.
Please write if you're interested!

$2400 per month, Lefferts Garden, 1200 sq ft., The Home Away From Home
Available: July 1, 2013 through August 31, 2014
Hello and welcome if you so choose to live in my apartment for some  time. =
I'm looking
for a year long sublet to bless my home with their  positive energy and ope=
n spirit.
This place is special, comfortable and  legend has it that anyone who walks=
 through
the door feels right at  home. :) This is a one bedroom apartment, with bri=
ght colors
through  out. It receives good light throughout the day and is very close t=
o  Prospect
Park and the B/Q subway. It's about 25 minutes to Union Sq.  downtown Manha=
ttan.
Inside it's all hardwood floors, full bathroom, large closet space, full  e=
at in
 kitchen with all new and working appliances. A chef's dream for  sure. Cab=
le and
internet connection comes along with the apt. Laundry is  in the building a=
nd the
super is on site in case anything unexpected  were to happen.
My neighbors are kind and more than generous to help with anything. The  ap=
artment
is located in Lefferts Garden Brooklyn. It's within walking  distance to Pr=
ospect
Park and very close to Brooklyn Botanic Gardens,  Brooklyn Museum, and Broo=
klyn=20
Library. This place is ideal for a couple  or for a small young family. It'=
s 1200
square ft. and just the spot you  want to come home to at the end of the da=
y.
New restaurants and businesses are popping up and overall is a very  friend=
ly safe
neighborhood. Trust me you want to stay here! I only ask  that while you st=
ay, you
water the plants talk to them every once in a  while and feed my fish. If o=
ne or
 two of the fish decide to move on to  wetter pastures thats ok too. Also I=
 am a
 member of the Botanical  Gardens and the Brooklyn Museum and will be leavi=
ng those
passes for  you!
I'm asking 2400$ a month and that includes all utilities and security in  c=
ase anything
unexpected were to happen that needs repair.

$1500 per month, Greenpoint, 800 square feet, Beautiful, Sunny Railroad Apa=
rtment
Available: July 4 through July 24 (the month is negotiable)
We're a couple who work in the arts and we're going to Russia in July.  Our=
 apartment
is essentially a one-bedroom railroad setup. Ideally,  we're looking for a =
couple
or a single person for a three-week stay. But  the dates are negotiable. Ke=
ep in
 mind also the apartment can be  arranged as a two bedroom-we have two matt=
resses,
a wooden screen, and  thick curtains on hand to accommodate such arrangemen=
ts. Lastly,
there  is an option to watch our cats, a Maine Coon and a Calico. Should th=
e  subletter
agree to the cat-sitting, there would be a two hundred dollar  break on the=
 rent.
Still, this is not necessary as we have other  arrangements on hand.
As far as the clinical layout of the apartment is concerned, it is a  seque=
nce of
four rooms. The front room is the study - a fairly typical  one at that. Th=
ere are
desks, a couch, piles of books. This is the room  that can be converted int=
o second
bedroom if necessary. It gets  wonderful afternoon sunlight. This is follow=
ed by
 the bedroom, arranged  with a queen sized bed, bureau, record collection. =
Moving
forward,  there's the parlor with the couch, the eames chair, and the old E=
merson
 turntable. Then there's the kitchen which enjoys plenty of morning sun.  T=
he apartment
is overrun with books, records, and space for projects. We  do have plants =
and a
 small herb garden, so tending to them in the peak  of summer is a necessit=
y. Also,
we have an air conditioner.
Our street is tranquil and tree canopied. Around the corner, there is  McGo=
lrick
 Park--a beautiful park with with huge hundred year old trees.  On this sid=
e of=20
McGuinness Blvd, there's Little Dokebi, Cafe Variety,  Onyx (Greenpoint Hei=
ghts),
the Palace, Syrena's, Salamat Pagi, and  Vinnie's Pizzeria. On the other si=
de of
 McGuinness, there's the Triple  Entente of cafe culture (i.e. Manhattan In=
n, Five
Leaves, Enid's). Then  going south on the other side of the BQE, there's th=
e Graham
Ave area  with plenty of shops, cafes, restaurants, and bars. Overall, it's=
 a  great
neighborhood to live in.

$1000 per month, open to wherever in Brooklyn, Seeking the elusive studio a=
pt
Available: ASAP
Hi Listings Project people,
I'm starting the new apartment hunt - so here are my details, in no particu=
lar order:
- size: open to what kind of place - could be a studio or 1 bedroom. I  do =
NOT need
a lot of room - I don't have any furniture other than a bed.
- location: ideally in Brooklyn - preference is for BedStuy (where my  boyf=
riend
 lives) or the more west part of Brooklyn (Fort Greene, Clinton  Hill, Broo=
klyn=20
Heights, Prospect Heights area) but I'm open minded as  long as it's safe a=
nd near
public transit and grocery stores etc.
- reasonable: would love to find something less than $1000 I'd like to buil=
d up=20
my savings.
- etc.: some nice to haves would be laundry in the building or nearby  (not=
 a biggie)
and me not on the top floor of 5 floors to walk up -  although I am open mi=
nded.
- sane roommates: part of my need to move is the current batch of  hippies =
I'm living
with - they don't clean after themselves and now we  have mice, and I'd jus=
t like
a quiet place that doesn't play live music  (drums) and/or arguing at 1 am =
- or=20
the dropping acid, or people in  white robes having meditation ceremonies (=
it would
be hilarious if it  wasn't my life). I'm open to living with others, but th=
is was
a little  more gutterpunk than I was looking for. Overnight guests are fine=
 - I=20
 have a boyfriend who will visit, but we're both ridiculously quiet and  re=
spectful.
 My preference is for a tiny studio, but I wouldn't mind  living with ONE o=
ther=20
independent, mature, artistic but quiet woman in  her 30s if we could split=
 a 2=20
bedroom.
- timing: ideally find something in the July 1st range. I'm on a month  to =
month
 at my current apartment, so something sooner rather than later  would work=
. Just
have to give 30 day's notice here, but would like to  secure a place first.=
 I am
 open to leases, subleases, month to months  and whanot.
My description is this: I'm a responsible, quiet, artsy software  designer.=
 I'm=20
Canadian by birth, which means very polite (I also do say  'eh' and 'aboot'=
), and
I'm clean and take care of common areas and don't  blast strange atonal mus=
ic at
 odd hours. I'm financially responsible,  have good credit, like direct and=
 friendly
communication, harmony and  making people feel happy - I think of it as a '=
home'
 and not just 'an  apartment', and would like a place to bake, relax, watch=
 the=20
odd movie  and be a real happy home. I don't smoke, and like a clean place,=
  although
I'm not obsessive about it. If there are dishes in the sink,  I'll wash the=
m :)=20
I'm open to living with whomever - gay, straight,  purple, green - the emph=
asis=20
is on responsible, considerate people. I'm  your typical artsy, film going,=
 thrift
store loving woman just looking  for a stable non-gutterpunk like home.
If you know of a studio, PLEASE let me know.  If you're looking for an  apa=
rtment
and want to combine forces, are looking for a roommate, let me  know too. E=
ven if
you're curious and aren't sure, send me a message so  we can meet over coff=
ee and
find an awesome place together.
Regards,
Rachel

Sublet or Share
Available: ASAP through Flexible
I am a creative, professional female, seeking a sublet or share. My  timefr=
ame is
3-4 months, possibly longer, with a flexible start date. My  budget is $125=
0, but
flexible for the right situation.
Originally from CT, I moved to New York to attend NYU. I have an MBA in  Ma=
rketing,
also attended Cooper Union, and have created a career that  combines both m=
y business
& creative skills. I am a Marketing and  Product Development Specialist and=
 work
 with companies that are  primarily in the beauty, fashion, personal care, =
and nutrition
 industries.
Recently I began another business as a Space Organizer and Designer.  This =
grew=20
very organically...my close friends saw my apartment and how I  lived and h=
ired=20
me to help them organize and design their own  apartments. Then I sublet fr=
om someone
for a month, and she came back  feeling that her place felt "better" than w=
hen she
left, so she hired me  to organize her studio in Red Hook. Through referral=
s, my
 business has  grown, so I have been pursuing it on a part-time basis.
In my spare time, I love to take long, meandering walks through the  city, =
travel
(just got back from Buenos Aires), read, and draw. I also  have many friend=
s in=20
the city, but prefer to go out, rather than  entertain at home. Occasionall=
y a friend
will stop by for a cup of tea  or a glass of wine, but most often, I prefer=
 to keep
my living space  private.
While I am quiet, considerate, neat, reliable, and possess most of the  des=
irable
tenant/roommate qualities, I am also friendly, outgoing, and  willing to he=
lp anyone
in need. I was always my neighbors' favorite  neighbor.
I realize that I have made many references to my prior apartment;  unfortun=
ately
 it was flooded and is unlivable; hence, my search.
I am a non-smoker and do not have any pets.
Thank you for your time,
Nancy

Available: June 15 through June 15
Hi!  I'm a visual artist (mostly sculpture and drawing) looking to find  bo=

studio mate and studio to share.  Figured it might work out  $-wise to find=
 a $600-700ish
studio and split it.
I work off the Jefferson L stop and live off the J train so something  alon=
g those
lines or bikeable is perfect.  I'll pretty much never be in  the studio Mon=
-Thurs
daytime b/c of work, though i'm totally open to our  paths crossing or co-w=
orking
at times.
I'd like a few white walls and definitely floor space to work on.  A window=
.
Someone fun, respectful and kind would be nice.  I'm the same :)
Let me know if you are interested and we can grab a coffee.
Thanks!

Dating, All NYC, Offline dating network - if Grouper and Pandora had a baby
Looking for a better way to meet great people in NYC? So am I, so I  create=
d The
 Dating Ring. What's that, you may ask? Good question. In  short, if Groupe=
r and
 Pandora met on OkCupid and had a super smart baby,  it would be The Dating=
 Ring.
The network is invite / application only,  and composed of attractive, acco=
mplished,
20 and 30-somethings. Everyone  meets me, Lauren (a fellow singleton, 'pro'=
 online
dater, Brown '11  grad (where I majored in love) and founder of a 4-year-ol=
d babysitting
 company, SmartSitting) in person, and I do the work for you, of setting  y=
ou up
 with your next soulmate or cuddle buddy.
The personal touch of matchmaking is then combined with the powers of  tech=
nology
and a super smart matching algorithm in the works, that  improves with dati=
ng feedback.
Aside from meeting everyone in person and  screening out the weirdos, the n=
etwork
is a much lower pressure layer  on top of 'real' life, meant to connect the=
 dots
 of living it up in NYC.
We live in an amazing city with amazing people and a billion amazing  thing=
s we=20
could be doing every day - but everyone, and everything, is so  disconnecte=
d. I=20
match members up on group dates, some 1-on-1 dates and  generally just open=
 up my
social calendar to the group - from jogs  around BK Bridge Park to Mad Men =
screenings
.. it's all happening. Or  going to. I promise. The network is just a fun w=
ay to
 keep living your  normally awesome, amazing life, but with a few more peop=
le to
 do that  with. Or it. Or whatever.
You can view current members here:  https://www.facebook.com/groups/4581200=
44281868/?fref=3Dts

 If you look like a good fit, I will ask to meet in person over drinks,  wi=
th a=20
few fellow newbies. We're in a trial run now, so all setups are  free.
Does this all sound ridiculous? That's cause it is. So is love. The  loneli=
ness=20
of NYC makes me sad and I'm going to be my crazy self and try  to fix this =
problem,
yenta style.

50 per month, Red Hook, 1200 sf, creative & sunny artist loft<br /> Availab=
le: June 15 through ?<br /><br /> 1) THE PLACE<br /> <br /> It's a 1200 sf =
loft on the top floor of an old factory building in  amazing Red Hook; 17' =
ceilings and a full height window wall with a view  of the harbor and Manha=
ttan & Brooklyn skylines. Old refinished  wood floors, simple modern kitche=
n and bathroom. There are two 160 sf  bedrooms tucked in the mezzanine floo=
r overlooking the main space -- I'm  in one, and the other is available beg=
inning in mid-June. The loft is  something of a work in progress, improving=
 bit by bit. It's a pretty  non-traditional setup -- there's an industrial =
ladder on wheels to  access the bedrooms, a hammock, hanging bicycles & a p=
retty massive  coffee table made out of a steel fire door, among other thin=
gs. One wall  is for projecting films, and there's plenty of room for spraw=
ling and  staring at the city. The building's fantastic as well - a big com=
plex  full of artists and musicians and designers with a courtyard for  bar=
becues & gardening & drinking to boot. There's wireless  internet and a lau=
ndry room on the floor. Red Hook is weird and  wonderful, still mostly off =
the beaten track and all the better for it,  in my view the most interestin=
g piece of Brooklyn by far. Great bars,  great food, great creative energy =
-- everything gets made here, from  coffee to whiskey to furniture to flyin=
g bicycles. The building's on  Coffey Park, a block away from Van Brunt Str=
eet, the main thoroughfare  of Red Hook, lined with bars, restaurants, gall=
eries and artisan shops.  At its end is Fairway (giant grocery heaven), the=
 piers (new york's only  frontal view of the statue of liberty), the NY Wat=
er Taxi (free weekend  boatrides to Manhattan) and Steve's Key Lime Pies (!=
). In the other  direction it's a 10 minute walk over the newly opened pede=
strian bridge  to the F / G subway at Carroll St, which is 10-15 minutes fr=
om downtown  Manhattan / LES and 15-20 minutes from Union Square / Chelsea.=
<br /> <br /> 2) THE ROOM<br /> <br /> The bedroom offered doesn't have a d=
oor or a lock - like my bedroom,  it's enclosed by walls on three sides and=
 has a thick sound-blanket on  the front overlooking the main space. So whi=
le I'm a pretty respectful  dude, if you need total silence and privacy the=
 room might not be for  you -- if you're a loft-liver or light-lover it mig=
ht be. The room's  clean and furnished with a single full size mattress, sh=
eets, thick  fluffy comforter thing, pillows and towels. There are lights a=
nd plenty  of outlets in the room, and shelves and a clothesrack for storag=
e.<br /> <br /> 3) THE PEOPLE<br /> <br /> I'm an architect and builder; I =
work in Manhattan weekdays and at my  shop in Williamsburg some portion of =
most weekends, though I mostly hang  out in Red Hook otherwise. Sometimes o=
ut late, sometimes not. I  generally have some projects going on - I'm alwa=
ys making stuff for the  loft, and I work on bikes on the side, so there's =
some occasional  messiness, but I usually like to keep things organized if =
I'm not in the  midst of anything. I do believe I'm pretty easy to get alon=
g with, but  it is very much a shared space, so it's important I guess to f=
eel it  out.<br /> <br /> 4) THE SITUATION<br /> <br /> My current roommate=
's moving back to Berlin on June 13 or so, and I'm  aiming to rent the room=
 on a part time basis. I haven't really decided  what I'm going to do in th=
e long term with the space, but I'd definitely  like to share it for the re=
mainder of June and maybe July.  Unfortunately I've a lot of things up in t=
he air, & can't commit to  more than a month right now -- but I reckon it m=
ight be perfect for  someone who wants a bit of flexible time to look for a=
 real lease, or  who's interested in checking out the neighborhood, or who =
just doesn't  have a set schedule yet. I'm more than open to renting weekly=
.<br /> <br /> Rent's $1250/mo, or $350/wk, + 1/2 utilities pro-rated -- us=
ually  internet + elec + gas is around $120/mo, or $30/wk, divided between =
the  two of us.<br /><br /> <a style=3D"color: black;" shape=3D"rect" href=

st 1 through TBD<br /><br /> Hi, I am a bit of a regular on Stephanie's lis=
t, and have always been  thankful for the wonderful people her project has =
sent me to rent my  lovely furnished apartment.<br /> <br /> For this time =
around I will be going away for 8 weeks to Boston for a  residency and am l=
ooking for a quiet, clean and respectful roommate for a  short term sublet =
that has the potential to become a longer term  rental. <br /> <br /> From =
June 11 - 29 I will be renting out my furnished bedroom at $65 a  day. It i=
s the smaller bedroom of a real 800 sq ft two bedroom apartment  in a brand=
 new elevator building. The larger master bedroom is  currently being rente=
d by a young actress from Spain until June 29.  After she leaves the, the l=
arger room will be available until July 3  after which the whole place will=
 be full until August 1. <br /> <br /> After August 1st I am looking for ne=
w roommates to rent both the smaller  room until August 11 and the larger m=
aster bedroom for long term at  $1,300 a month.<br /> <br /> Ok, so I know =
this sounds rather complicated, but if you are intrigued  lets start a conv=
ersation to see what we can work out. You can read some  great reviews of m=
y place through airbnb at  https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17716<br /> <br /> =
The rent includes all utilities and internet, shared bathroom and a  fully =
stocked kitchen (tend to try to keep it close to vegetarian with  just chic=
ken or fish.) Both rooms are furnished with a bed, chairs,  storage shelves=
, a closet, sheets, towels and blankets. My smaller room  has a murphy bed =
that can be raised to allow space for working at a desk  or practicing yoga=
. The Master bedroom has a bed that can fold up into a  couch, a desk, a fe=
w smaller tables and a wonderful antique dining  table for eating in. <br /=
> <br /> While I am away the living room will be available to share with a =
dining  table, desks and couch. When I return in August I use the living ro=
om  as my office/studio when I work at home.<br /> <br /> I am on the secon=
d floor facing north on a quiet residential street with  tree top views, AC=
, WiFi, hard wood floors and good clean neighbors,  very safe. Alas there i=
s no laundry in the building, but plenty of  Laundromats around the corner,=
 as well as 2 major subway stops, nice  supermarket and lots of cool restau=
rants and bars nearby. The best part  is only being 2 blocks north of Centr=
al Park!<br /><br /> <a style=3D"color: black;" shape=3D"rect" href=3D"http=

 1.5 bath, and  a great wood stove that keeps the house comfortable during =
the cold  months, looks out on a meandering stream that crosses the propert=
y.<br /> This rental is intended for a single person, but I am open to disc=
ussing the possibility of sharing with a couple.<br /> We can discuss what =
would be the best arrangement for both of us. One  option could be where yo=
u basically have the house all to yourself,  except for two weekends a mont=
h when I will use the house exclusively.  That obviously would not work if =
you are planning to move into the house  full-time. Unless you can be flexi=
ble about these two weekends. Another  option could be where on average 6 d=
ays a week you have the place all  to your self. I would come up from NYC a=
bout once a week to stay for a  day ( 2 nights usually). Holidays can be di=
scussed.<br /> If you can be okay with any of the above arrangements, this =
might be a  great deal for you. I prefer more prolonged commitments (6+ mon=
ths ) but  will consider shorter rentals. Non-smokers only. You can check t=
he  house out - and for more pictures - by visiting the somewhat dated hous=
e  website www.catskillrentalhouse.com<br /> I am planning to install a was=
her/dryer in the next 6 months. And a  bathhouse with sauna-room next to th=
e stream in the next 12 months or  so.<br /> If you're wondering what kind =
of art I'm involved with you can see and  hear some of that on my website: =

a year long sublet to bless my home with their  positive energy and open sp=
irit. This place is special, comfortable and  legend has it that anyone who=
 walks through the door feels right at  home. :) This is a one bedroom apar=
tment, with bright colors through  out. It receives good light throughout t=
he day and is very close to  Prospect Park and the B/Q subway. It's about 2=
5 minutes to Union Sq.  downtown Manhattan. <br /> <br /> Inside it's all h=
ardwood floors, full bathroom, large closet space, full  eat in kitchen wit=
h all new and working appliances. A chef's dream for  sure. Cable and inter=
net connection comes along with the apt. Laundry is  in the building and th=
e super is on site in case anything unexpected  were to happen. <br /> <br =
/> My neighbors are kind and more than generous to help with anything. The =
 apartment is located in Lefferts Garden Brooklyn. It's within walking  dis=
tance to Prospect Park and very close to Brooklyn Botanic Gardens,  Brookly=
n Museum, and Brooklyn Library. This place is ideal for a couple  or for a =
small young family. It's 1200 square ft. and just the spot you  want to com=
e home to at the end of the day. <br /> <br /> New restaurants and business=
es are popping up and overall is a very  friendly safe neighborhood. Trust =
me you want to stay here! I only ask  that while you stay, you water the pl=
ants talk to them every once in a  while and feed my fish. If one or two of=
 the fish decide to move on to  wetter pastures thats ok too. Also I am a m=
ember of the Botanical  Gardens and the Brooklyn Museum and will be leaving=
 those passes for  you! <br /> <br /> I'm asking 2400$ a month and that inc=
ludes all utilities and security in  case anything unexpected were to happe=
n that needs repair.<br /><br /> <a style=3D"color: black;" shape=3D"rect" =

00 per month, Greenpoint, 800 square feet, Beautiful, Sunny Railroad Apartm=
ent<br /> Available: July 4 through July 24 (the month is negotiable)<br />=
<br /> We're a couple who work in the arts and we're going to Russia in Jul=
y.  Our apartment is essentially a one-bedroom railroad setup. Ideally,  we=
're looking for a couple or a single person for a three-week stay. But  the=
 dates are negotiable. Keep in mind also the apartment can be  arranged as =
a two bedroom-we have two mattresses, a wooden screen, and  thick curtains =
on hand to accommodate such arrangements. Lastly, there  is an option to wa=
tch our cats, a Maine Coon and a Calico. Should the  subletter agree to the=
 cat-sitting, there would be a two hundred dollar  break on the rent. Still=
, this is not necessary as we have other  arrangements on hand.<br /> <br /=
> As far as the clinical layout of the apartment is concerned, it is a  seq=
uence of four rooms. The front room is the study - a fairly typical  one at=
 that. There are desks, a couch, piles of books. This is the room  that can=
 be converted into second bedroom if necessary. It gets  wonderful afternoo=
n sunlight. This is followed by the bedroom, arranged  with a queen sized b=
ed, bureau, record collection. Moving forward,  there's the parlor with the=
 couch, the eames chair, and the old Emerson  turntable. Then there's the k=
itchen which enjoys plenty of morning sun.  The apartment is overrun with b=
ooks, records, and space for projects. We  do have plants and a small herb =
garden, so tending to them in the peak  of summer is a necessity. Also, we =
have an air conditioner.<br /> <br /> Our street is tranquil and tree canop=
ied. Around the corner, there is  McGolrick Park--a beautiful park with wit=
h huge hundred year old trees.  On this side of McGuinness Blvd, there's Li=
ttle Dokebi, Cafe Variety,  Onyx (Greenpoint Heights), the Palace, Syrena's=
, Salamat Pagi, and  Vinnie's Pizzeria. On the other side of McGuinness, th=
ere's the Triple  Entente of cafe culture (i.e. Manhattan Inn, Five Leaves,=
 Enid's). Then  going south on the other side of the BQE, there's the Graha=
m Ave area  with plenty of shops, cafes, restaurants, and bars. Overall, it=
's a  great neighborhood to live in.<br /><br /> <a style=3D"color: black;"=

00 per month, open to wherever in Brooklyn, Seeking the elusive studio apt<=
br /> Available: ASAP<br /><br /> Hi Listings Project people,<br /> <br /> =
I'm starting the new apartment hunt - so here are my details, in no particu=
lar order:<br /> <br /> - size: open to what kind of place - could be a stu=
dio or 1 bedroom. I  do NOT need a lot of room - I don't have any furniture=
 other than a bed.<br /> - location: ideally in Brooklyn - preference is fo=
r BedStuy (where my  boyfriend lives) or the more west part of Brooklyn (Fo=
rt Greene, Clinton  Hill, Brooklyn Heights, Prospect Heights area) but I'm =
open minded as  long as it's safe and near public transit and grocery store=
s etc.<br /> - reasonable: would love to find something less than $1000 I'd=
 like to build up my savings.<br /> - etc.: some nice to haves would be lau=
ndry in the building or nearby  (not a biggie) and me not on the top floor =
of 5 floors to walk up -  although I am open minded.<br /> <br /> - sane ro=
ommates: part of my need to move is the current batch of  hippies I'm livin=
g with - they don't clean after themselves and now we  have mice, and I'd j=
ust like a quiet place that doesn't play live music  (drums) and/or arguing=
 at 1 am - or the dropping acid, or people in  white robes having meditatio=
n ceremonies (it would be hilarious if it  wasn't my life). I'm open to liv=
ing with others, but this was a little  more gutterpunk than I was looking =
for. Overnight guests are fine - I  have a boyfriend who will visit, but we=
're both ridiculously quiet and  respectful.  My preference is for a tiny s=
tudio, but I wouldn't mind  living with ONE other independent, mature, arti=
stic but quiet woman in  her 30s if we could split a 2 bedroom.<br /> <br /=
> - timing: ideally find something in the July 1st range. I'm on a month  t=
o month at my current apartment, so something sooner rather than later  wou=
ld work. Just have to give 30 day's notice here, but would like to  secure =
a place first. I am open to leases, subleases, month to months  and whanot.=
<br /> <br /> My description is this: I'm a responsible, quiet, artsy softw=
are  designer. I'm Canadian by birth, which means very polite (I also do sa=
y  'eh' and 'aboot'), and I'm clean and take care of common areas and don't=
  blast strange atonal music at odd hours. I'm financially responsible,  ha=
ve good credit, like direct and friendly communication, harmony and  making=
 people feel happy - I think of it as a 'home' and not just 'an  apartment'=
, and would like a place to bake, relax, watch the odd movie  and be a real=
 happy home. I don't smoke, and like a clean place,  although I'm not obses=
sive about it. If there are dishes in the sink,  I'll wash them :) I'm open=
 to living with whomever - gay, straight,  purple, green - the emphasis is =
on responsible, considerate people. I'm  your typical artsy, film going, th=
rift store loving woman just looking  for a stable non-gutterpunk like home=
.<br /> <br /> If you know of a studio, PLEASE let me know.  If you're look=
ing for an  apartment and want to combine forces, are looking for a roommat=
e, let me  know too. Even if you're curious and aren't sure, send me a mess=
age so  we can meet over coffee and find an awesome place together.<br /> <=

 am a creative, professional female, seeking a sublet or share. My  timefra=
me is 3-4 months, possibly longer, with a flexible start date. My  budget i=
s $1250, but flexible for the right situation. <br /> <br /> Originally fro=
m CT, I moved to New York to attend NYU. I have an MBA in  Marketing, also =
attended Cooper Union, and have created a career that  combines both my bus=
iness & creative skills. I am a Marketing and  Product Development Speciali=
st and work with companies that are  primarily in the beauty, fashion, pers=
onal care, and nutrition  industries. <br /> <br /> Recently I began anothe=
r business as a Space Organizer and Designer.  This grew very organically..=
.my close friends saw my apartment and how I  lived and hired me to help th=
em organize and design their own  apartments. Then I sublet from someone fo=
r a month, and she came back  feeling that her place felt "better" than whe=
n she left, so she hired me  to organize her studio in Red Hook. Through re=
ferrals, my business has  grown, so I have been pursuing it on a part-time =
basis. <br /> <br /> In my spare time, I love to take long, meandering walk=
s through the  city, travel (just got back from Buenos Aires), read, and dr=
aw. I also  have many friends in the city, but prefer to go out, rather tha=
n  entertain at home. Occasionally a friend will stop by for a cup of tea  =
or a glass of wine, but most often, I prefer to keep my living space  priva=
te.<br /> <br /> While I am quiet, considerate, neat, reliable, and possess=
 most of the  desirable tenant/roommate qualities, I am also friendly, outg=
oing, and  willing to help anyone in need. I was always my neighbors' favor=
ite  neighbor.<br /> <br /> I realize that I have made many references to m=
y prior apartment;  unfortunately it was flooded and is unlivable; hence, m=
y search. <br /> <br /> I am a non-smoker and do not have any pets.<br /> <=

0 per month, Bushwick / Bedstuy, Artist looking for studio and studio mate<=
br /> Available: June 15 through June 15<br /><br /> Hi!  I'm a visual arti=
st (mostly sculpture and drawing) looking to find  both a studio mate and s=
tudio to share.  Figured it might work out  $-wise to find a $600-700ish st=
udio and split it.<br /> <br /> I work off the Jefferson L stop and live of=
f the J train so something  along those lines or bikeable is perfect.  I'll=
 pretty much never be in  the studio Mon-Thurs daytime b/c of work, though =
i'm totally open to our  paths crossing or co-working at times.  <br /> <br=
 /> I'd like a few white walls and definitely floor space to work on.  A wi=
ndow.<br /> <br /> Someone fun, respectful and kind would be nice.  I'm the=
 same :)<br /> <br /> Let me know if you are interested and we can grab a c=
offee.<br /> <br /> Thanks!<br /> Loren<br /><br /> Please contact Loren Er=

ing, All NYC, Offline dating network - if Grouper and Pandora had a baby<br=
 /> <br /> Looking for a better way to meet great people in NYC? So am I, s=
o I  created The Dating Ring. What's that, you may ask? Good question. In  =
short, if Grouper and Pandora met on OkCupid and had a super smart baby,  i=
t would be The Dating Ring. The network is invite / application only,  and =
composed of attractive, accomplished, 20 and 30-somethings. Everyone  meets=
 me, Lauren (a fellow singleton, 'pro' online dater, Brown '11  grad (where=
 I majored in love) and founder of a 4-year-old babysitting  company, Smart=
Sitting) in person, and I do the work for you, of setting  you up with your=
 next soulmate or cuddle buddy. <br /> <br /> The personal touch of matchma=
king is then combined with the powers of  technology and a super smart matc=
hing algorithm in the works, that  improves with dating feedback. Aside fro=
m meeting everyone in person and  screening out the weirdos, the network is=
 a much lower pressure layer  on top of 'real' life, meant to connect the d=
ots of living it up in NYC.  <br /> <br /> We live in an amazing city with =
amazing people and a billion amazing  things we could be doing every day - =
but everyone, and everything, is so  disconnected. I match members up on gr=
oup dates, some 1-on-1 dates and  generally just open up my social calendar=
 to the group - from jogs  around BK Bridge Park to Mad Men screenings .. i=
t's all happening. Or  going to. I promise. The network is just a fun way t=
o keep living your  normally awesome, amazing life, but with a few more peo=
ple to do that  with. Or it. Or whatever.<br /> <br /> You can view current=
 members here:  https://www.facebook.com/groups/458120044281868/?fref=3Dts =
, my rambly  'blog' here: thedatingring.tumblr.com and my personal Facebook=
 page  here: https://www.facebook.com/laurenikay .<br /> How to join?: Fill=
 out the application / private profile here:  https://docs.google.com/forms=
/d/1cXYLSNsT5djJNil-zP41PIfcSu6NKQ0ZLto4WeAZPAI/viewform.  If you look like=
 a good fit, I will ask to meet in person over drinks,  with a few fellow n=
ewbies. We're in a trial run now, so all setups are  free.<br /> <br /> Doe=
s this all sound ridiculous? That's cause it is. So is love. The  lonelines=
s of NYC makes me sad and I'm going to be my crazy self and try  to fix thi=
s problem, yenta style.<br /><br /> <a style=3D"color: black;" shape=3D"rec=
