Label News

So, another month has passed here at Sorry State HQ... all of the
leaves are orange and falling off the trees, it's cold as crap outside
and I just want to sleep. Sadly, we still don't have any of our new
releases for sale yet, but I did receive word that the Louder LP was
pressed on Friday, just in time to get the band's copies to them in
Japan for their record release show (a deadline we were sweating!).
That means we'll probably have our copies in a week and a half or so,
so look for those to pop up on the site around then. Of course I'll
give you a full run-down in the next update, but if you like catchy
'77-style punk like Rough Kids or 90s Japanese bands like the
Registrators and Teengenerate this is not one to be missed.

Aside from that, things keep plugging along. I approved the test
pressings for the Davidians single (volume 1 of Sorry State's North
Carolina singles series) and the Skemata LP around the same time as
Louder, so hopefully that means those will be out sometime soon. After
that follow already-mentioned releases from No Love, Gay Kiss, Broken
Prayer, Dark Ages, and Oblivionation. Earlier this month Black
Zinfandel also finished their recording for Volume 3 of the NC Singles
Series and I think that Nick G=E2=89=A0 is going to lay down some vox for
the upcoming 3rd Joint D=E2=89=A0 LP this month as well. We've got more =
than
enough to keep us busy around here.

For any North Carolina folks that are reading this, in a little more
than a week I'm promoting the North Carolina stop on the Forward /
Long Knife tour. It's rare that bands from Japan make it all the way
down here, and if you saw past sets by Slang and System Fucker you
know this is not one to be missed. Also on the bill are Skem=C3=A4ta and
the Raleigh debut of Nick G=E2=89=A0's new project Microrave. Should be
quite an evening! Here's the Facebook event if you want to RSVP:
https://www.facebook.com/events/844328605597382/ (
https://www.facebook.com/events/844328605597382/ ).

Also, on October 26 we celebrated the one-year anniversary of our
physical store in downtown Raleigh! I'm pretty proud of what we've
accomplished, and I should also note that I couldn't do this without
Seth and Jeff as well as all of the other people who help us out on
the regular. Things are looking pretty good... I'm still not paying
myself (haha!), but we're in pretty good health and hope to be here
for another year at least. So stop by and say hi if you're ever in
town!

I think that's all that's happening at the moment... but of course
I'll be back again soon with more info!

Jeff's Update

What=E2=80=99s up, Sorry Staters?

I can=E2=80=99t believe Sorry State has already been open for a year.  I
feel stoked and lucky to be a part of this place every day.  Thanks
everyone for the support!

October had some killer new releases come through the store.  =
Here=E2=80=99s
a list of ten picks that I would definitely recommend checking out.
All great stuff:

- Urbanoia - Psykisk Terror 7=E2=80=9D (Awesome no-frills hardcore punk =
from
Norway)
- YDI =E2=80=93 A Place in the Sun 7=E2=80=9D (reissue, criminally =
underrated 80s
HC)
- Institute =E2=80=93 Salt 12=E2=80=9D  (TX punk band=E2=80=99s =
latest/best effort, has
anarcho vibes)
- Dia Final =E2=80=93 demo  (LA raw punk sang in Spanish, killer stuff!)
- The #1=E2=80=99s 12=E2=80=9D (Legit power-pop from Ireland, previously =
on Sorry
State!)
- Pura Man=C3=ADa =E2=80=93 Both of the new 7=E2=80=9Ds (CAN=E2=80=99T =
RECOMMEND ENOUGH.)
- Radioactivity =E2=80=93 Danger 7=E2=80=9D (More catchy tunes from the =
Ex-Marked
Men)
- The Brood =E2=80=93 Defective 7=E2=80=9D (tough, heavy HC from Philly!)
- RHDP =E2=80=93 Parusa 7=E2=80=9D (Rocked out, sang in Spanish, Tension =
Head!!)
- Crimen =E2=80=93 El Problema Eres Tu cassette (Killer tape -- catchy,
primitive raw punk from Mexico)

As far as stuff going on with me, both the Skem=C3=A4ta 12=E2=80=9D and =
the new
Mercy Killings 7=E2=80=9D are still on the way and should be out any time
now.  The next shows we=E2=80=99ve got coming up are the Raleigh and
Richmond shows for Forward and Long Knife, both of which should be
rad.  Skem=C3=A4ta has some other shows coming up early next year and then
we=E2=80=99re planning on touring later on in 2015.  Not sure what Mercy
Killings has planned for later this year/early next year.  I=E2=80=99ve =
got
some other music projects in the works too, but more on that later.

Thanks for reading!  =E2=80=98Til next month.-Jeff

Seth's Update

Well Rocktober is coming to an end, so it=E2=80=99s this time again. This
month has felt forever long. One of the first things I remember
getting in this month that was a big hit with me was the PIGZ =E2=80=93
BLOODY BELGIUM 7=E2=80=9D on Ugly Pop; an amazing reissue of great KBD =
Punk
with lots of attitude and grit. Ugly Pop always does an amazing job
with their releases. Speaking of Ugly Pop, we also got in the X =E2=80=93
ASPIRATIONS 12=E2=80=9D reissue they put out. It=E2=80=99s great early =
80=E2=80=99s punk
from Australia, if you haven=E2=80=99t heard it yet then I suggest =
checking
it out, definitely a classic punk album. I had THE HA-RANG! stop in
the store before their show in town and drop off some copies of their
tape, SHE WANTS PRETTY. I gave it a listen to and loved it. The
opening song DeLorean Girls is a little silly but really a great
catchy song that=E2=80=99s ton of fun. Definitely a band to keep an eye on
if you=E2=80=99re into fun reverb and synth soaked garage pop. It also
features Betsy Wright from EX HEX doing background vocals. Which
brings me to my next record, EX HEX =E2=80=93RIPS. This is just great rock
that is catchy as hell. It=E2=80=99s the kind of record you=E2=80=99d =
imagine
playing during a scene on TV or in a movie of a teenager closing
themselves in their room and blaring while jumping on the bed and
miming along to. Well at least that=E2=80=99s what I see in my head, or
maybe it=E2=80=99s what I would be doing while listening to this album =
alone
at home. Anyways=E2=80=A6. AUSMUTEANTS have another LP. There=E2=80=99s =
not much
to say about it other than it=E2=80=99s an Ausmuteants album, you get
exactly what you would expect from this band, which is pure synth punk
gold.  If you liked their other records then you will like this
record. We also got a lot of cool reissues from TheCramps, Jawbreaker,
Iron Maiden, The Oblivions, and a ton more you should checkout and
get.

Daniel's Update

So without a doubt the records of the month for me are the two Pura
Mania singles... I think that everyone around Sorry State HQ is pretty
obsessed with this band, and with good reason. While 2014 has seen
some strong records, these two singles might be my favorite of the
entire bunch. It's just PUNK... parts of it remind me of New Age-era
Blitz, but there's a lot of classic Spanish punk and international
hardcore in the sound as well... at any rate, it's utterly unique and
brilliant and we just got it back in stock, so be sure to grab it.

As for other stuff, in the hardcore realm I'd definitely recommend the
under-the-radar rager from Urbanoia, the great new Nerv 7", the
Breakout 7" on Grave Mistake, and the Brood's debut 7".

If you're looking for melodic/punk stuff there were also a lot of
great releases this month. The new Institute 12" is really fabulous...
it's a little more melodic than their other recent releases, and the
powerful mastering job on the vinyl has kept this on my turntable
quite a bit. Of course everyone around Sorry State loves the #1s
album, and the new PC Worship and Ausmuteants LPs have gotten quite a
lot of play as well. The surprise of the month, though, is probably
the Dark Blue. I wasn't super into their earlier 7"s for whatever
reason, but this LP has hit me pretty hard. It's really upbeat,
song-oriented post-punk that, at its best, reminds me of a sunnier
version of the almighty Chameleons. If you're on the fence about
picking that up I'd highly encourage you to take the plunge... you
definitely won't be disappointed.

And as usual there were a lot of great reissues as well... I've spent
a lot of time with those X records, and the YDI EP is essential USHC.
There were also a lot of things in the rest of the stock list that I
love... Jawbreaker's 24 Hour Revenge Therapy, the Gun Club's Fire of
Love... the list goes on and on!

I should also mention that we have a lot of big distro orders we're
expecting any day now, so this week you'll probably see new records
added from Impalers, Big Zit, Ooze, Ratka, Boston Strangler, and tons
of others. So keep checking the site regularly!

Top distro sellers for October:

1. DiE: Vexed 7" (Sonic Terror)
2. Whatever Brains: SSR-63/SSR-64 2x12" (Sorry State)
3. Ausmuteants: Fed Through a Tube 7" (Total Punk)

Featured Distro Items

Various: Concentrated Visuals cassette (Space Ritual)
Brand new compilation of contemporary Australian punk and hardcore
bands. You'll recognize a few of them like Die Gutter Gods, Prag,
Helta Skelta, Vaginors and Plastic Bags from previous Sorry State
updates, but a few of these bands like Oily Boys, Simfuckers, and
Unpeople I know only from cryptic message board posts by people who
must either be 1. from Australia 2. way cooler than me or 3. both.
Anyway, this is a very different punk scene than the one a lot of
people think of when they think of current Australian punk, which I
think is more associated with the garage-punk and post-punk styles
(I'm thinking of bands like Total Control, Eddy Current Suppression
Ring, UV Race, Ausmuteants, etc.). However, this is much more
hardcore, though with a marked weirdness... if you've checked out Die
Gutter Gods or Vaginors you know what I'm talking about. I think my
favorite of the lot (at least as far as new discoveries) is Unpeople,
who deliver two lurching, heavily Rudimentary Peni-influenced tracks
that really stick out. There are a bunch of great bands here, though,
and if you're a looking for a sampler of this unique punk scene this
one is certainly the most definitive one yet.

Failed Mutation: demo 7" (self-released)
Man, the way that record reviewers talk about the whole
demo-put-to-vinyl phenomenon you'd think it was nearly as bad as
ebola, but if it means you get EPs like this then I'm all for it...
Failed Mutation hail from Wisconsin and feature Eric, the drummer for
Tenement, on guitar, but this ain't no pop-punk record... this is some
nasty yet catchy US hardcore in the vein of bands like Sin 34. I
imagine that'll probably be a big reference for people because of the
powerful lady on the microphone, but the music matches pretty well
too... it's just fast, catchy US hardcore with killer songwriting and
subtle but memorable hooks. This sound was probably overdone in the No
Way heyday years, but honestly there aren't too many bands nowadays
doing this kind of authentic early 80s US punk sound, and it's really
jumping out of the speakers for me. Highly recommended if you're still
getting down with this style.

YDI: A Place in the Sun 7" (Southern Lord)
Southern Lord continue their recent trend of taking classic 80s USHC
records and reworking the artwork so they look like stoner rock
records, but hey, the music is still the same and at least it's not as
embarrassing as the reissue of the Negative Approach 7". YDI's EP is
one of the few great hardcore records to come out of the surprisingly
(given its size) poorly-documented Philadelphia hardcore scene, and
it's a mean and nasty little slice of USHC. The recording is super
raw, the music is a bit sloppy, but this thing just drips with anger.
It doesn't have the catchy punk quality of a lot of top-tier USHC, and
both the metallic recording quality and the burly vocals (to me at
least) have always seemed kind of similar to late 80s NYC bands like
Breakdown. If you're an 80s hardcore head you know and love this
record already, but if pure USHC like Koro and Mecht Mensch and you
haven't given this a chance I'd highly encourage you to get on board.

Crimen: El Problema Eres Tu cassette (MMM)
2nd full-length from this Mexico City punk band. Apparently this was
supposed to be released on vinyl in time for the band's recent US
shows, but there was some kind of problem and I guess now this
cassette is the only way you're going to get to hear this release. On
first listen I thought maybe I put the wrong tape in the player,
because this is very different from the raw d-beat hardcore that
appeared on the band's previous 7". Instead, this is tuneful punk with
post-punk touches, much more in line with the history of classic
Spanish punk and hardcore. There are still some hardcore elements as
well, and at times some of the songs are so different in style that it
can sound a little schizophrenic, but honestly I'm into that... too
many bands nowadays only write songs in one specific style and it
makes both listeners and the bands themselves burn out way too
quickly. This comes at punk from a whole bunch of different angles and
is all the better for it. If you've been following the recent wave of
great punk out of Mexico you'll want to check this out, as these bands
have a vitality and sense of now-ness that is unmatched by pretty much
any scene in the world.

RHDP: Parusa 7" (Tension Head)
When Jeff pulled this record out of its mailer he blurted out "RED
HOT DILL PICKLES," and it's officially all that I can think of when I
see the cover of this record. I'm not one to let a stupid joke ruin a
record for me, though, and when I slapped this one on I got some
awesome catchy punk. Musically, this is kind rock and roll-inflected
classic punk with a hardcore heaviness, and right off the bat it
reminds me a bit of Ruleta Rusa or Los Monjo, but heavier and
grittier. There are some Hot Snakes vibes to the riffing and even a
weird, swmapy breakdown that kind of sounds like a different band with
the same vocalist (maybe kind of Annihilation Time-y?), but then it's
back to punk. I think if you'd blindfolded me and told me this was a
new band from the Houston crew behind Secret Prostitutes / No Talk /
The Real Energy / etc. I would have no trouble believing it, but fans
of anything from Cloak/Dagger to Annihilation Time will have no
problem enjoying this. Plus, it's always good to hear something good
coming out of my abandoned homeland of Virginia Beach, Virginia.

Excel: Split Image 2x12"+7" (Southern Lord)
I don't think I'd actually heard Excel's Split Image LP before
this... like a lot of the Suicidal Tendencies-related stuff, the
original is quite rare and doesn't really turn up all too often on
here on the east coast, so I'd never had a chance to check it out.
Really, it's about what I expected it to be... solid,
hardcore-influenced (mainly in the vocals) 80s thrash that could fit
in just as well with the whole bay Area scene as it does with the
Suicidal camp, though without the blazing solos one typically
associates with that genre. Split Image is a solid thrash album, but
the real gem here is the bonus material... I know Southern Lord often
goes overboard in adding extras (honestly I'm not even sure I listened
to all three of those 12"s that came with the Bl'ast! Power of
Expression reissue, and I'm probably not alone on that), but with this
record the bonus disc is probably going to get a lot more play than
the main event. The bonus disc is an earlier demo session that's a lot
more hardcore than Splitting Image... the riffs aren't quite so
thrashy, but the drumming is still fast and manic, and the whole thing
is recorded extremely well. It sounds much more in line with metallic
early 80s hardcore bands like Attitude Adjustment and Septic Death,
and it's honestly just as good as those... I'm surprised Pusmort
didn't snatch these guys up back then. If you like both of those
styles then this luxurious package is a no-brainer, but if you're more
of a thrash metal person or a hardcore person there's more than enough
here to make it worth your well... a worthy excavation for sure.

Radioactivity: Danger 7" (Secret Mission)
Radioactivity, in case you didn't know, features two of the guys from
Marked Men, and places front and center the songwriting and singing of
Jeff Burke, who wins by a hair in the competition for "best songwriter
in the Marked Men." This 7" contains two new songs from Radioactivity,
which means that you should buy it because all Radioactivity songs are
really, really good. I would say more, but hopefully by now everyone
knows how awesome this band is, and if you like poppy, energetic punk
you know that everything they produce is must-hear material.

Iceage: Plowing Into the Fields of Love 12" (Matador)
Iceage's second LP felt like a somewhat more mature update on the
unique sound of their first record, but on this new LP they've finally
moved past the kind of ramshackle punk sound that characterized their
first two releases and arrived at something totally different. You
won't hear any of the barely-together, 1-2-1-2 hardcore drumming that
previously formed the quirky backbone of their sound... instead, the
whole band seems to be following vocalist Elias Bender R=C3=B8nnenfelt,
crafting a moody mix of tunes that actually give shape and subtlety to
his powerful vocals rather than just smashing against them in an
interesting way. I admit, I kind of miss their old sound (and maybe
there are some shades of it in the Gun Club-ish "The Lord's
Favorite"), but I'm pretty sure I'd also be bored if they did the same
thing again. Instead, this is dense, provocative pop music that's
cinematic in scope... not unlike those middle-era Nick Cave and the
Bad Seeds LPs, after he'd worked all of the Birthday Party out of his
sound and arrived at what he's now best known for. It's a long, dense,
and at times a trying listen (especially if you like your music
bouncy, fun, and dumb), but after just a couple of listens it strikes
me as an LP that's well worth spending some time with.

Dark Blue: Pure Reality 12" (Jade Tree)
After a couple of relatively low-profile 7" releases, here's the
debut LP from Dark Blue, the new-ish band featuring John Sharkey of
Puerto Rico Flowers, Clockcleaner, and numerous other bands. From the
beginning, the name of the game with Dark Blue has been oi!/pop, which
I take to mean that they're inspired by Second Empire Justice, the
formerly-controversial, now-canonical second Blitz LP. I'm not really
sure if that was the band's expressed intent or just some description
I'd read somewhere, but I'd say there isn't really much oi! to be
found here, but instead a kind of 80s-style New Romantic pop. It is a
lot more upbeat and fun than Puerto Rico Flowers, and at their best
Dark Blue remind me a lot of the early Chameleons stuff collected on
the (freaking amazing) The Fan and the Bellows LP. So yeah, it
definitely has a kind of "post-punk" vibe, but it's poppy, fun, and
almost sunny in a way... I have to admit that I wasn't really sold on
the 7"s, but I'm really enjoying this LP, and if you're a fan of the
Chameleons / Echo and the Bunnymen / later Siouxsie type of poppy
post-punk sound I imagine you will be as well.

The Brood: Defective 7" (self-released)
Debut 7" from this Philadelphia band, and like their killer demo tape
it's a ripping little slice of straightforward, no-nonsense hardcore.
The Brood kind of reminds me of Wasted Time a little bit in that
Poison Idea clearly seems to be the main influence, and there's a
total bulldozer effect to the way that the entire thing comes
together. There are a couple of little tricks here and there to keep
your ear interested... a couple of lead guitar parts, some catchy
little stops and starts... but at the end of the day this is just
bruising hardcore... if that's what you want to hear I'd recommend you
pick this up.

Ausmuteants: Order of Operation 12" (Goner)
So there have been a whole slew of new Ausmuteants releases that have
come out in the past few weeks / months (presumably in concurrence
with the band's US tour dates), and after a couple of delays we
finally have the new full-length on Goner. If you're expecting
something different from these guys you're probably going to be sorely
disappointed, as this pretty much gives us more of the same energetic,
synth-tastic punk that has appeared on all of their previous releases.
It's kind of incredible that they've managed to write this many songs
and maintain a consistent level of quality across all of their
releases, but it's hard to argue that this new LP signifies any kind
of appreciable dip in quality. The riffs and synth lines are still
ridiculously catchy, the lyrics are still really dumb and fun, and the
rhythm section still barrels forward with unmatched energy. I can
imagine their releases seeming somewhat redundant at some point, but
if you've worn out their first full-length like I have you'll be happy
as a pig in slop just to have more.

Razorheads: S/T 7" (Failure)
After a standout cassette release here's the vinyl debut from NJ's
Razorheads... this is a total, full-bore hardcore ripper. The label's
description gives the usual reference points like Anti-Cimex, but I
think this is really something different entirely. While there might
be a bit of Discharge influence in the riffing, this is faster,
tighter, and denser than most straight up d-beat bands and in places
it's more akin to the complex, intricate kind of hardcore that
Skem=C3=A4ta are doing. The production is also really abrasive, but more
in a "noisy" way than a "raw" way if that makes sense... in this
respect it kind of sounds more like more recent Japanese bands like
D-Clone and Zyanose, but the song structures are a lot more linear and
familiar. But, basically, if you're into the kind of heavy,
well-played and well-recorded hardcore that comes out of Sweden and
Japan you will love this... a real bruiser.

PC Worship: Social Rust 12" (Dull Tools)
Latest LP from this New York band, and I have to say after having
tried several times before, I finally "get it." It's hard for me to
gauge how much the outside world knows about PC Worship because their
name looms so large in the world of Whatever Brains... they're
frequent tourmates, and (along with Protomartyr) one of the few bands
that Brains mastermind Rich dubs one of the "great current American
rock bands." Well, basically if you're the kind of person from whom a
recommendation from the Whatever Brains camp carries any weight,
you'll want to pick up this album right away. It's definitely on a
similar tip... maybe a little more experimental and a little less
poppy, but with a more straightforward and familiar vocal sound. Like
the Brains, though, PC Worship share an affinity for making great rock
songs out of unfamiliar rhythms and sonic textures, so if that's your
bag this album is as epic and all-consuming a journey as you're likely
to find.

Dia Final: demo cassette (self-released)
Demo cassette from this new band featuring a bunch of veterans of the
Los Angeles punk scene. This is an absolutely explosive demo
cassette... the music is built around pretty simple 1-2 drumming and
strong and simple punk riffs, but something about the performance here
just jumps out of the speakers. It definitely bears a little bit of
resemblance to the whole Ruleta Rusa / Peligro Social style, but the
production is much more raw, the vocals have more of a kind of snotty,
'77 flavor that recalls bands like the Stitches, and the music is much
more straightforward and stripped-down. Dia Final definitely aren't
reinventing the wheel, but with this style either you sound explosive
or you don't, and this one will knock you on your ass.

Institute: Salt 12" (Sacred Bones)
Brand new 12" from this Austin, TX punk band, and as you can expect
there's a slight uptick in production quality now that they've moved
to Sacred Bones. However, this doesn't mean so much that the
production is "better," but rather than that it's even more spot-on in
terms of replicating the sound of Institute's clear influences.
Seriously, there are moments on this record where I have to honestly
ask myself, "did I put on the Zounds LP by mistake?" The lead guitar
tone is literally almost an exact match. I'm sure that some people
will dismiss them as a soundalike band, but  I really like Institute,
and I think this is easily their strongest material yet... the clearer
production really serves them well, and the lead guitar lines in
particular here are just absolutely infectious. It seems like lots of
bands lay claim to a Crisis / Zounds influence, but it's really
striking how much Institute sound like those bands, and honestly the
music is of just as high quality. I've been playing this over and over
since we got it in and I don't think it's going to leave the turntable
any time soon.

Pura Mania: Musica Para Genta Fea 7" (CV)
Pura Mania: La Estafa Musical 7" (CV)
So, even though these are two separate releases, I'm going to write
one description to cover both... these appear to have been recorded at
the same session, and the concurrent release time and similar artwork
seem to imply that they are meant to be considered together. Now that
I have that out of the way I can say GET BOTH OF THESE RECORDS RIGHT
NOW!!!! Seriously, I can't remember the last time I've fallen this
head over heels for a band. Pura Mania have one of the most original,
exciting sounds I've heard in ages... a slightly quirky but utterly
unique combination of melodic 80s Spanish punk like Eskorbuto, tough
hardcore, oi!, and a little dash of new wave. I know that
"description" isn't very descriptive at all, but Pura Mania are a very
difficult band to pin down... the vocals and the drums are very
simple, straightforward, and tough, but on their best songs like
"Musica Para Genta Fea," the guitars and bass go off in a completely
different direction, recalling the dynamic interplay of post-punk /
new wave greats like Wire and Magazine. Basically, it's like Pura
Mania have made this band explicitly to appeal to my personal tastes,
simultaneously tickling the parts of my brain that crave tough
hardcore and oi!, simple and catchy melodies, and the interesting
instrumental dynamics of post-punk. It's crazy that Pura Mania are
this relentlessly good, but nothing about the packaging or
presentation really screams "this is some next-level shit." It's
doubtful that these guys will become the next big thing or that anyone
will think you're cooler for owning these records (except for me!),
but those in the know will insist that these are two of the best
records to be released in the year 2014. Utterly, utterly essential...
highest possible recommendation!

Desperfecto: Demo 2013 cassette	(CV)
Demo tape from this punk band out of Santiago, Chile. These (mostly)
ladies play raw, rudimentary, and catchy punk rock... I'm reminded
more than a little bit of Cocadictos, but Desperfecto are a little
more basic and not quite as explosive. If you dig raw,
straightforward, and catchy lady-fronted punk like Vice Squad or
Violators, or the amped-up sound of catchy Spanish punk like Vulpess
this is well worth checking out.

Makarra: Mierda de Hardkore cassette	(CV)
Killer demo from this band out of Lima, Peru. This is so weird, raw,
primitive, and awesome that I can't really get over it. I was
listening to it earlier today (for like the 5th time in a row... it's
that good) and my friend Sean was like, "is this a weird Wipers demo
or something?" which is something I never really would have thought of
because I'd imagine the band probably thinks of themselves more in the
lineage of bands like Sarcofago, Hellhammer, and Venom... i.e. tough,
raw metal bands, but it does have this strange hypnotic quality that
definitely recalls the Wipers. I'm also reminded a bit of GISM, though
without Randy Uchida's distinctive leads... instead, Makarra have more
of that strange haunting quality that GISM captured so well. I
probably don't have the expertise in the history of metal to describe
this accurately, but rest assured it is completely freaking awesome...
definitely recommended if you're into any of the aforementioned bands.

Ausmuteants: Fed Through a Tube 7" (Total Punk)
Latest single from this great Australian band, released just in time
for their recent US tour. If you haven't heard Ausmuteants yet, they
play completely infectious, high-energy new wave-infused punk. They
kind of remind me of the Spits in that they have that constant
16th-notes-on-the-hi-hats thing as well as some catchy synths, and
their songwriting is of the "Ramones on 45RPM" school. Really, what's
not to like? It's simple, catchy, maybe even slightly dumb punk rock,
and if that's your style (i.e. you buy releases on Total Punk Records)
you really need this one as well.

P.I.G.Z.: Bloody Belgium 7" (Ugly Pop)
Another month goes by and Ugly Pop reissues another shit-rare
first-gen punker... how does Simon do it? This time around it's the
sole single by Belgium's P.I.G.Z. from 1978. This is an energetic,
stomping and straightforward punk single that reminds me a lot of the
UK stuff that was starting in 1978 and 1979 as the second wave of punk
got underway. There's a slight rock and roll edge to the riffing that
almost makes this sound Australian, particularly on the standout
track, "Stooges." A few of these songs have been comped, but this
legit reissue is the only way you're going to hear all three, and as
with all of Ugly Pop's reissues you get a beautiful reproduction of
the original packaging and a bunch of extras as well, in this case a
12-page, 7"-inch-sized booklet that features an essay about the band
and record from Simon and a number of vintage press clippings.

X: X-Aspirations 12" (Ugly Pop)
Reissue of the killer first album by this first-gen Australian punk
band on the great Ugly Pop label. As we've come to expect from Ugly
Pop, all of the packaging, artwork, liner notes, and mastering are all
top-notch and definitely the next best thing to owning an original
copy. This LP has long been a personal favorite of mine... it's a very
weird record... undeniably punk, but also undeniably something else as
well. Even though they're from Australia, on this record I'm reminded
less of the amped-up, Stooges-influenced sound of bands like Radio
Birdman and the Saints and more of groups that kind of got lumped in
with punk but weren't really... bands like the Stranglers and Wire, as
well as first-gen post-punks like Gang of Four and the Pop Group.
While those references may make it seem as if X are more post- than
punk, X-Aspirations is an energetic, even explosive record... it's
just one with a ambition and dynamics that are beyond those of the
typical punk band. So yeah, basically, this is a great album and even
the 90s reissue is hard to come by these days, so there's no reason
not to add this excellent reissue to your collection.

X: X-Spurts: The 1977 Demos 12" (Ugly Pop)
First time on vinyl for this rare 1977 demo session by the Australian
band X (not to be confused, of course, with the band from Los Angeles
with the same name). Apparently this recording session was thought to
be completely lost, but was only recently recovered on an old,
battered cassette tape. I went into this thinking that it was probably
going to just be some demo recordings that the band made in advance of
their great debut record, X-Aspirations (also recently reissued by
Ugly Pop), but it turns out this is a completely different record that
captures a completely different era of the band (only one track,
"Revolution," appears on both X-Spurts and X-Aspirations). This
earlier version had a completely different lineup (I believe there was
only one member who played on both sessions), and has a lot more of
the muscular and melodic, Stooges-inspired propulsion that I associate
with early Australian punk than X-Aspirations, which is an incredible
album but much more dynamic, minimal, and with more of a post-punk
flair. X-Spurts, however, is balls-to-the-wall rock and roll, and if
you dig records like the Saints' Eternally Yours, Radio Birdman's two
LPs, or comparable British bands like Slaughter & the Dogs or the
Damned then you will want to hear this. It also contains a large,
12"x24" lyric insert with a bunch of photos and a ton of liner notes
providing contextual information about the album. Totally essential.

Various: Easier Said than Done cassette (self-released)
Brand new compilation of current Philadelphia hardcore and punk...
includes a track each from the Stasi (a total ripper!), New Crime,
Dark Thoughts, Blank Spell, Fuck SS, Batworm, Haldol, Low Charge,
Latex, Skin Graft, Stuck Pig, Holidays, Bad Energy, and Cool Life.
It's funny, for a city its size Philadelphia has never had a
particularly well-documented hardcore/punk scene, and Easier Said than
Done goes a long way toward remedying that. While there is some
diversity here, a majority of the bands play dark and straightforward
hardcore. I wouldn't say there's something so distinctive as a
"Philadelphia sound," but the bands all present top-notch material
(with some like the Stasi and Haldol really standing out) and if
you're interested in this kind of regional punk/hardcore compilation
you can't go wrong with this.

Asylum: S/T 7" (Vinyl Conflict)
Debut 7" from this Richmond, VA hardcore punk band. I've seen these
folks a couple of times and I like the fact that I can't really
pinpoint their sound... I guess at the end of the day this is just
bruising hardcore punk with a gnarly, aggressive woman on vocals. It
kind reminds me of meat-and-potatoes Bay Area groups like Look Back
and Laugh or Replica, but Asylum also have an element of
straightforward, GBH-type punk in their riffs that makes this a little
more of a catchy fist-pumper. God bless Vinyl Conflict for putting out
well-done, interesting regional hardcore punk like this.

Breakout: True Crime 7" (Grave Mistake)
2nd EP (the first one was self-released) from this Texas band. For
some reason I was thinking that a band called Breakout was going to
sound like NYHC or something, but this EP is really incredible, and
sounds nothing like that at all... there's definitely a hardcore
element (as you might expect from Grave Mistake), but there's a lot of
stranger stuff happening as well. There's a lot of interesting
interplay between the instruments that kind of reminds me of their
fellow Texans Institute, but much harder, denser, and more intense.
The label description actually mentions the Ruts (one of my favorite
bands), and I can totally hear that on the standout track, "All's
Quiet," which sounds kind of like a combination of the Ruts and
Zounds. It's really refreshing to hear a band incorporate those
influences without sounding like a total tribute band (which Institute
are occasionally guilty of), and at the end of the day I can't really
think of another band that Breakout sound like, and in my book there's
really no higher compliment for a hardcore punk record.

The #1s: S/T 12" (Deranged)
After what seems like quite a bit of delay, the vinyl for the #1s
debut 12" is out! I put out their previous single so it's no secret
that I absolutely adore this band, and I've been listening to this LP
quite a bit. I have to admit that when I first got it I was a little
disappointed that there wasn't more new material (it includes all
three tracks from the "Sharon" single that I put out as well as
several tracks from their previous EP and demo), but at the end of the
day it's nice to have it all in one place (particularly for those of
you who weren't lucky to grab the super hard to find first EP), and
even one new track by this band would make a record worth getting. Oh,
and if you haven't heard the #1s, they play upbeat, infectious
power-pop in the tradition of bands like Protex and the Exploding
Hearts, and for my money there is no one on the planet doing it better
at the moment.

Cardiac Arrest: In the Mouth of Madness 12" (Lumpy)
I don't think that many people expected a new Cardiac Arrest LP in
the year 2014, but here it is! It seems like not a lot of people knew
they were still active, but I guess they've been plugging away in St.
Louis chipping away at writing this full-length. As you might expect
from a band that's been around for a decade by now, this definitely
shows some development from their earlier stuff, but all in all the
formula hasn't really changed... it's still blistering,
balls-to-the-wall hardcore with Rob's trademark menacing yet catchy
vocal style. Their two EPs were total gut punches, but you can tell
that a lot of thought and work went into the LP as there's a lot of
attention to pacing and sequencing to make sure you keep flipping this
again and again. The production is also fantastic... straightforward
and dry but punchy as hell. Basically, if you're still interested in
this kind of early 80s-inspired USHC you're going to want to pick this
up, as it's incredibly well-executed and infectious.

Ausmuteants: Power Hour Value Pack cassette (Lumpy)
I could be wrong, but I think that this might be the first time Lumpy
has expanded his purview outside of his native great St. Louis area,
and boy does he go worldwide with a bang, collecting 32 unreleased and
demo tracks from Australia's Ausmuteants in time for their US tour.
While there's some pretty straightforward Ausmuteants stuff on here,
judging by the sound and instrumentation it sounds like a lot of these
tracks are home demos that were recorded by band members individually
as part of the songwriting process... I love this kind of thing as
comparing these to the ultimately released versions is an interesting
window into how they put these songs together. Regardless, if you're
an Ausmuteants fan you'll want this, and you can beat it at 32 tracks
for a few bucks...

Weed Hounds: S/T 12" (Katorga Works)
It's funny, I don't think I'd actually heard Weed Hounds' music
before, but I knew their name because they were kind of a running joke
in Katorga Works emails... I think Adam's been saying "Weed Hounds LP
will be out soon" for several years now. Not having any idea what
these guys actually sound like I was pleasantly surprised by some
great, kind of shoegaze-y indie-pop. It's definitely more toward the
Merchandise end of the Katorga Works catalog, but the band that Weed
Hounds really remind me of is Siamese Twins... just like the Twins,
their music seems to come to the listener through a kind of dense,
hazy filter. For a lot of bands that sheen of noise is the beginning
and end of their sound, but Weed Hounds have more than enough melody
and songwriting skill that bubbles up to the surface and keeps things
interesting. Just like their punk stuff, when Katorga Works puts out a
more indie-ish release like this you know it's going to be top-notch.
Definitely recommended if you like the aforementioned bands.

Nerv: Off Earth Now 7" (Lagerville)
Brand new 7" from this band out of Iowa. Their previous 7" was a
store favorite... a totally unique blast of pure Midwestern hardcore a
la Die Kreuzen or Mecht Mensch. While that's still the foundation
here, things are a little bit different this time around. First of
all, the production is a lot more dense, compressed, and
disorienting... it's one of those recordings that sounds like the
music is being beamed directly into your brain stem rather than like
you're listening to an actual band, and while that may sound like a
bad thing it actually fits this band's style of quirky hardcore quite
well. Fans of Nasa Space Universe take note as this band are on a
similar trip, though it's a little bit less "out there" and a little
more in line with the classic USHC sound.

Generacion Suicida: Todo Terminida 12" (Going Underground)
Brand new 12" EP from this LA-area band. When Generacion Suicida
started it was clear that they had a major fascination with the
X-on-downers sound of Masshysteri and their earlier stuff felt (to me
at least) like a scrappier, more DIY take on that sound. While that's
still a big element of their sound here, things have evolved a bit,
and for the better. First of all (and I don't have any of their other
records handy to check), but I don't remember this band having such a
sick bass player... whoever is playing bass is just all over the
place, laying down this constant, fluid stream of 16th-notes that pull
the songs in these great, Eskorbuto-esque melodic directions while the
guitars and vocals chug along at a more straightforward punk pace. The
slight disjunction between these elements of the band's sound really
drives things forward and keeps it very interesting throughout, and of
course since the core of their sound is very melodic the whole thing
is very catchy and memorable. While I know this band gets kind of
pegged as a Masshysteri-influenced band, the songs on this record are
almost exclusively blistering fast and melodic, almost sounding in
places like a kind of melancholic take on pogo punk. It's a weird
combination, but totally unique and killer.

Sick Thoughts: Coming Over 7" (Going Underground)
Latest 7" from this one-man project out of Baltimore. I think I've
carried just about all of Drew's records up to this point and they've
definitely gotten a lot better... I remember getting a very angry
email from him a few months ago complaining that my descriptions of
his records painted him as nothing more than a Reatards ripoff. I
think the evidence kind of speaks for itself on those early records
(not that they're not great, they're just heavily indebted to the
Reatards), but he's definitely be onto some different shit lately.
This new stuff has much more of a KBD feel with a seriously warped
guitar sound and a much more riff-oriented, song-y approach that's way
more memorable than anything he's done. Everything is catchier,
wilder, and ultimately more memorable... I'd stack these three rippers
up against any neo-KBD band and it would blow 99% of it away... I
can't think of another group doing a more authentically raw and wild
take on the KBD sound, so if you're a fan of those old comps or of
raw, wild garage rock like Teengenerate this is one you'll definitely
need to add to your pile.

Urbanoia: Psykisk Terror 7" (Solar Funeral)
2nd EP from this raging Norweigan hardcore band on the great Solar
Funeral label. You can always count on SF to put out above-the-bar
hardcore (and they're even releasing the next Skem=C3=A4ta 7"!), and this
EP is no different. This 4-song EP is very short (about 4 minutes in
total), but you shouldn't hold the band's economy against them... this
is straightforward, pounding, and well-produced hardcore in the
tradition of Norweigan bands like Svart Framtid, Headcleaners, and
Akutt Innleggelse... no guitar solos, no fake "raw punk" vibe, just
straight up hardcore. If that's your style then this one is pretty
much essential.

Fashionable Activism #3 zine
Third issue if this punk fanzine, and it's pretty much a complete
reboot in terms of both aesthetics and content. The editor moved from
Minneapolis to Austin, TX and completed a design degree, and according
to the preface he's decided to be much more deliberate about the
zine's aesthetic, working hard to avoid common and cliche visual
tropes, and the content of the zine is also more focused on design
rather than just music. This time around you get interviews with Laura
Pallmall of Blotter, the artist Elijah Funk, and the St. Louis band
Black Panties. I really hope that Kevin continues on this path as it
seems like a really good direction, and it's rare these days to see a
real "punk" fanzine that actually wants to be more than just another
punk fanzine.

So, another month has passed here at Sorry State HQ... all of the leaves =
are orange and falling off the trees, it's cold as crap outside and I just =
want to sleep. Sadly, we still don't have any of our new releases for sale =
yet, but I did receive word that the Louder LP was pressed on Friday, just =
in time to get the band's copies to them in Japan for their record release =
show (a deadline we were sweating!). That means we'll probably have our =
copies in a week and a half or so, so look for those to pop up on the site =
around then. Of course I'll give you a full run-down in the next update, =
but if you like catchy '77-style punk like Rough Kids or 90s Japanese =
bands like the Registrators and Teengenerate this is not one to be =
missed.<br><br>
Aside from that, things keep plugging along. I approved the test pressings =
for the Davidians single (volume 1 of Sorry State's North Carolina singles =
series) and the Skemata LP around the same time as Louder, so hopefully =
that means those will be out sometime soon. After that follow =
already-mentioned releases from No Love, Gay Kiss, Broken Prayer, Dark =
Ages, and Oblivionation. Earlier this month Black Zinfandel also finished =
their recording for Volume 3 of the NC Singles Series and I think that =
Nick G&ne; is going to lay down some vox for the upcoming 3rd Joint D&ne; =
LP this month as well. We've got more than enough to keep us busy around =
here.<br><br>

For any North Carolina folks that are reading this, in a little more than =
a week I'm promoting the North Carolina stop on the Forward / Long Knife =
tour. It's rare that bands from Japan make it all the way down here, and =
if you saw past sets by Slang and System Fucker you know this is not one =
to be missed. Also on the bill are Skem&auml;ta and the Raleigh debut of =
Nick G&ne;'s new project Microrave. Should be quite an evening! Here's the =
Facebook event if you want to RSVP: <a href=3D"http://t.ymlp328.net/esuaia=

<br><br>
Also, on October 26 we celebrated the one-year anniversary of our physical =
store in downtown Raleigh! I'm pretty proud of what we've accomplished, =
and I should also note that I couldn't do this without Seth and Jeff as =
well as all of the other people who help us out on the regular. Things are =
looking pretty good... I'm still not paying myself (haha!), but we're in =
pretty good health and hope to be here for another year at least. So stop =
by and say hi if you're ever in town!<br><br>
I think that's all that's happening at the moment... but of course I'll be =
back again soon with more info!

What&rsquo;s up, Sorry Staters?<br><br>
I can&rsquo;t believe Sorry State has already been open for a year.
I feel stoked and lucky to be a part of this place every day.
Thanks everyone for the support!<br><br>
October had some killer new releases come through the store.
Here&rsquo;s a list of ten picks that I would definitely recommend =
checking out.
All great stuff:<br><br>
- Urbanoia - Psykisk Terror 7&rdquo; (Awesome no-frills hardcore punk from =
Norway)<br>
- YDI &ndash; A Place in the Sun 7&rdquo; (reissue, criminally underrated =
80s HC)<br>
- Institute &ndash; Salt 12&rdquo;
(TX punk band&rsquo;s latest/best effort, has anarcho vibes)<br>
- Dia Final &ndash; demo
(LA raw punk sang in Spanish, killer stuff!)<br>
- The #1&rsquo;s 12&rdquo; (Legit power-pop from Ireland, previously on =
Sorry State!)<br>
- Pura Man&iacute;a &ndash; Both of the new 7&rdquo;s (CAN&rsquo;T =
RECOMMEND ENOUGH.)<br>
- Radioactivity &ndash; Danger 7&rdquo; (More catchy tunes from the =
Ex-Marked Men)<br>
- The Brood &ndash; Defective 7&rdquo; (tough, heavy HC from Philly!)<br>
- RHDP &ndash; Parusa 7&rdquo; (Rocked out, sang in Spanish, Tension =
Head!!)<br>
- Crimen &ndash; El Problema Eres Tu cassette (Killer tape -- catchy, =
primitive raw punk from Mexico)<br><br>
As far as stuff going on with me, both the Skem&auml;ta 12&rdquo; and the =
new Mercy Killings 7&rdquo; are still on the way and should be out any =
time now.
The next shows we&rsquo;ve got coming up are the Raleigh and Richmond =
shows for Forward and Long Knife, both of which should be rad.
Skem&auml;ta has some other shows coming up early next year and then =
we&rsquo;re planning on touring later on in 2015.
Not sure what Mercy Killings has planned for later this year/early next =
year.
I&rsquo;ve got some other music projects in the works too, but more on =
that later.<br><br>
Thanks for reading!
&lsquo;Til next month.
-Jeff

Well Rocktober is coming to an end, so it&rsquo;s this time again. This =
month has felt forever long. One of the first things I remember getting in =
this month that was a big hit with me was the PIGZ &ndash; BLOODY BELGIUM =
7&rdquo; on Ugly Pop; an amazing reissue of great KBD Punk with lots of =
attitude and grit. Ugly Pop always does an amazing job with their =
releases. Speaking of Ugly Pop, we also got in the X &ndash; ASPIRATIONS =
12&rdquo; reissue they put out. It&rsquo;s great early 80&rsquo;s punk =
from Australia, if you haven&rsquo;t heard it yet then I suggest checking =
it out, definitely a classic punk album. I had THE HA-RANG! stop in the =
store before their show in town and drop off some copies of their tape, =
SHE WANTS PRETTY. I gave it a listen to and loved it. The opening song =
DeLorean Girls is a little silly but really a great catchy song =
that&rsquo;s ton of fun. Definitely a band to keep an eye on if =
you&rsquo;re into fun reverb and synth soaked garage pop. It also features =
Betsy Wright from EX HEX doing background vocals. Which brings me to my =
next record, EX HEX &ndash;RIPS. This is just great rock that is catchy as =
hell. It&rsquo;s the kind of record you&rsquo;d imagine playing during a =
scene on TV or in a movie of a teenager closing themselves in their room =
and blaring while jumping on the bed and miming along to. Well at least =
that&rsquo;s what I see in my head, or maybe it&rsquo;s what I would be =
doing while listening to this album alone at home. Anyways&hellip;. =
AUSMUTEANTS have another LP. There&rsquo;s not much to say about it other =
than it&rsquo;s an Ausmuteants album, you get exactly what you would =
expect from this band, which is pure synth punk gold.
If you liked their other records then you will like this record. We also =
got a lot of cool reissues from TheCramps, Jawbreaker, Iron Maiden, The =
Oblivions, and a ton more you should checkout and get. <br><br>

So without a doubt the records of the month for me are the two Pura Mania =
singles... I think that everyone around Sorry State HQ is pretty obsessed =
with this band, and with good reason. While 2014 has seen some strong =
records, these two singles might be my favorite of the entire bunch. It's =
just PUNK... parts of it remind me of <i>New Age</i>-era Blitz, but =
there's a lot of classic Spanish punk and international hardcore in the =
sound as well... at any rate, it's utterly unique and brilliant and we =
just got it back in stock, so be sure to grab it.<br><br>
As for other stuff, in the hardcore realm I'd definitely recommend the =
under-the-radar rager from Urbanoia, the great new Nerv 7", the Breakout =
7" on Grave Mistake, and the Brood's debut 7".<br><br>
If you're looking for melodic/punk stuff there were also a lot of great =
releases this month. The new Institute 12" is really fabulous... it's a =
little more melodic than their other recent releases, and the powerful =
mastering job on the vinyl has kept this on my turntable quite a bit. Of =
course everyone around Sorry State loves the #1s album, and the new PC =
Worship and Ausmuteants LPs have gotten quite a lot of play as well. The =
surprise of the month, though, is probably the Dark Blue. I wasn't super =
into their earlier 7"s for whatever reason, but this LP has hit me pretty =
hard. It's really upbeat, song-oriented post-punk that, at its best, =
reminds me of a sunnier version of the almighty Chameleons. If you're on =
the fence about picking that up I'd highly encourage you to take the =
plunge... you definitely won't be disappointed.<br><br>
And as usual there were a lot of great reissues as well... I've spent a =
lot of time with those X records, and the YDI EP is essential USHC. There =
were also a lot of things in the rest of the stock list that I love... =
Jawbreaker's <i>24 Hour Revenge Therapy</i>, the Gun Club's <i>Fire of =
Love</i>... the list goes on and on!<br><br>
I should also mention that we have a lot of big distro orders we're =
expecting any day now, so this week you'll probably see new records added =
from Impalers, Big Zit, Ooze, Ratka, Boston Strangler, and tons of others. =
So keep checking the site regularly!<br><br>
Top distro sellers for October:<br><br>
1. DiE: <i>Vexed</i> 7" (Sonic Terror)<br>
2. Whatever Brains: <i>SSR-63/SSR-64</i> 2x12" (Sorry State)<br>

Various: <i>Concentrated Visuals</i> cassette (Space Ritual)<br>
Brand new compilation of contemporary Australian punk and hardcore bands. =
You'll recognize a few of them like Die Gutter Gods, Prag, Helta Skelta, =
Vaginors and Plastic Bags from previous Sorry State updates, but a few of =
these bands like Oily Boys, Simfuckers, and Unpeople I know only from =
cryptic message board posts by people who must either be 1. from Australia =
2. way cooler than me or 3. both. Anyway, this is a very different punk =
scene than the one a lot of people think of when they think of current =
Australian punk, which I think is more associated with the garage-punk and =
post-punk styles (I'm thinking of bands like Total Control, Eddy Current =
Suppression Ring, UV Race, Ausmuteants, etc.). However, this is much more =
hardcore, though with a marked weirdness... if you've checked out Die =
Gutter Gods or Vaginors you know what I'm talking about. I think my =
favorite of the lot (at least as far as new discoveries) is Unpeople, who =
deliver two lurching, heavily Rudimentary Peni-influenced tracks that =
really stick out. There are a bunch of great bands here, though, and if =
you're a looking for a sampler of this unique punk scene this one is =
certainly the most definitive one yet.<br><br>

Failed Mutation: demo 7" (self-released)<br>
Man, the way that record reviewers talk about the whole demo-put-to-vinyl =
phenomenon you'd think it was nearly as bad as ebola, but if it means you =
get EPs like this then I'm all for it... Failed Mutation hail from =
Wisconsin and feature Eric, the drummer for Tenement, on guitar, but this =
ain't no pop-punk record... this is some nasty yet catchy US hardcore in =
the vein of bands like Sin 34. I imagine that'll probably be a big =
reference for people because of the powerful lady on the microphone, but =
the music matches pretty well too... it's just fast, catchy US hardcore =
with killer songwriting and subtle but memorable hooks. This sound was =
probably overdone in the No Way heyday years, but honestly there aren't =
too many bands nowadays doing this kind of authentic early 80s US punk =
sound, and it's really jumping out of the speakers for me. Highly =
recommended if you're still getting down with this style.<br><br>

YDI: <i>A Place in the Sun</i> 7" (Southern Lord)<br>
Southern Lord continue their recent trend of taking classic 80s USHC =
records and reworking the artwork so they look like stoner rock records, =
but hey, the music is still the same and at least it's not as embarrassing =
as the reissue of the Negative Approach 7". YDI's EP is one of the few =
great hardcore records to come out of the surprisingly (given its size) =
poorly-documented Philadelphia hardcore scene, and it's a mean and nasty =
little slice of USHC. The recording is super raw, the music is a bit =
sloppy, but this thing just drips with anger. It doesn't have the catchy =
punk quality of a lot of top-tier USHC, and both the metallic recording =
quality and the burly vocals (to me at least) have always seemed kind of =
similar to late 80s NYC bands like Breakdown. If you're an 80s hardcore =
head you know and love this record already, but if pure USHC like Koro and =
Mecht Mensch and you haven't given this a chance I'd highly encourage you =
to get on board.<br><br>

Crimen: <i>El Problema Eres Tu</i> cassette (MMM)<br>
2nd full-length from this Mexico City punk band. Apparently this was =
supposed to be released on vinyl in time for the band's recent US shows, =
but there was some kind of problem and I guess now this cassette is the =
only way you're going to get to hear this release. On first listen I =
thought maybe I put the wrong tape in the player, because this is very =
different from the raw d-beat hardcore that appeared on the band's =
previous 7". Instead, this is tuneful punk with post-punk touches, much =
more in line with the history of classic Spanish punk and hardcore. There =
are still some hardcore elements as well, and at times some of the songs =
are so different in style that it can sound a little schizophrenic, but =
honestly I'm into that... too many bands nowadays only write songs in one =
specific style and it makes both listeners and the bands themselves burn =
out way too quickly. This comes at punk from a whole bunch of different =
angles and is all the better for it. If you've been following the recent =
wave of great punk out of Mexico you'll want to check this out, as these =
bands have a vitality and sense of now-ness that is unmatched by pretty =
much any scene in the world.<br><br>

RHDP: <i>Parusa</i> 7" (Tension Head)<br>
When Jeff pulled this record out of its mailer he blurted out "RED HOT =
DILL PICKLES," and it's officially all that I can think of when I see the =
cover of this record. I'm not one to let a stupid joke ruin a record for =
me, though, and when I slapped this one on I got some awesome catchy punk. =
Musically, this is kind rock and roll-inflected classic punk with a =
hardcore heaviness, and right off the bat it reminds me a bit of Ruleta =
Rusa or Los Monjo, but heavier and grittier. There are some Hot Snakes =
vibes to the riffing and even a weird, swmapy breakdown that kind of =
sounds like a different band with the same vocalist (maybe kind of =
Annihilation Time-y?), but then it's back to punk. I think if you'd =
blindfolded me and told me this was a new band from the Houston crew =
behind Secret Prostitutes / No Talk / The Real Energy / etc. I would have =
no trouble believing it, but fans of anything from Cloak/Dagger to =
Annihilation Time will have no problem enjoying this. Plus, it's always =
good to hear something good coming out of my abandoned homeland of =
Virginia Beach, Virginia.<br><br>

Excel: <i>Split Image</i> 2x12"+7" (Southern Lord)<br>
I don't think I'd actually heard Excel's <i>Split Image</i> LP before =
this... like a lot of the Suicidal Tendencies-related stuff, the original =
is quite rare and doesn't really turn up all too often on here on the east =
coast, so I'd never had a chance to check it out. Really, it's about what =
I expected it to be... solid, hardcore-influenced (mainly in the vocals) =
80s thrash that could fit in just as well with the whole bay Area scene as =
it does with the Suicidal camp, though without the blazing solos one =
typically associates with that genre. <i>Split Image</i> is a solid thrash =
album, but the real gem here is the bonus material... I know Southern Lord =
often goes overboard in adding extras (honestly I'm not even sure I =
listened to all three of those 12"s that came with the Bl'ast! <i>Power of =
Expression</i> reissue, and I'm probably not alone on that), but with this =
record the bonus disc is probably going to get a lot more play than the =
main event. The bonus disc is an earlier demo session that's a lot more =
hardcore than <i>Splitting Image</i>... the riffs aren't quite so thrashy, =
but the drumming is still fast and manic, and the whole thing is recorded =
extremely well. It sounds much more in line with metallic early 80s =
hardcore bands like Attitude Adjustment and Septic Death, and it's =
honestly just as good as those... I'm surprised Pusmort didn't snatch =
these guys up back then. If you like both of those styles then this =
luxurious package is a no-brainer, but if you're more of a thrash metal =
person or a hardcore person there's more than enough here to make it worth =
your well... a worthy excavation for sure.<br><br>

Radioactivity: <i>Danger</i> 7" (Secret Mission)<br>
Radioactivity, in case you didn't know, features two of the guys from =
Marked Men, and places front and center the songwriting and singing of =
Jeff Burke, who wins by a hair in the competition for "best songwriter in =
the Marked Men." This 7" contains two new songs from Radioactivity, which =
means that you should buy it because all Radioactivity songs are really, =
really good. I would say more, but hopefully by now everyone knows how =
awesome this band is, and if you like poppy, energetic punk you know that =
everything they produce is must-hear material.<br><br>

Iceage: <i>Plowing Into the Fields of Love</i> 12" (Matador)<br>
Iceage's second LP felt like a somewhat more mature update on the unique =
sound of their first record, but on this new LP they've finally moved past =
the kind of ramshackle punk sound that characterized their first two =
releases and arrived at something totally different. You won't hear any of =
the barely-together, 1-2-1-2 hardcore drumming that previously formed the =
quirky backbone of their sound... instead, the whole band seems to be =
following vocalist Elias Bender R&oslash;nnenfelt, crafting a moody mix of =
tunes that actually give shape and subtlety to his powerful vocals rather =
than just smashing against them in an interesting way. I admit, I kind of =
miss their old sound (and maybe there are some shades of it in the Gun =
Club-ish "The Lord's Favorite"), but I'm pretty sure I'd also be bored if =
they did the same thing again. Instead, this is dense, provocative pop =
music that's cinematic in scope... not unlike those middle-era Nick Cave =
and the Bad Seeds LPs, after he'd worked all of the Birthday Party out of =
his sound and arrived at what he's now best known for. It's a long, dense, =
and at times a trying listen (especially if you like your music bouncy, =
fun, and dumb), but after just a couple of listens it strikes me as an LP =
that's well worth spending some time with.<br><br>

Dark Blue: <i>Pure Reality</i> 12" (Jade Tree)<br>
After a couple of relatively low-profile 7" releases, here's the debut LP =
from Dark Blue, the new-ish band featuring John Sharkey of Puerto Rico =
Flowers, Clockcleaner, and numerous other bands. From the beginning, the =
name of the game with Dark Blue has been oi!/pop, which I take to mean =
that they're inspired by <i>Second Empire Justice</i>, the =
formerly-controversial, now-canonical second Blitz LP. I'm not really sure =
if that was the band's expressed intent or just some description I'd read =
somewhere, but I'd say there isn't really much oi! to be found here, but =
instead a kind of 80s-style New Romantic pop. It is a lot more upbeat and =
fun than Puerto Rico Flowers, and at their best Dark Blue remind me a lot =
of the early Chameleons stuff collected on the (freaking amazing) <i>The =
Fan and the Bellows</i> LP. So yeah, it definitely has a kind of =
"post-punk" vibe, but it's poppy, fun, and almost sunny in a way... I have =
to admit that I wasn't really sold on the 7"s, but I'm really enjoying =
this LP, and if you're a fan of the Chameleons / Echo and the Bunnymen / =
later Siouxsie type of poppy post-punk sound I imagine you will be as =
well.<br><br>

The Brood: <i>Defective</i> 7" (self-released)<br>
Debut 7" from this Philadelphia band, and like their killer demo tape it's =
a ripping little slice of straightforward, no-nonsense hardcore. The Brood =
kind of reminds me of Wasted Time a little bit in that Poison Idea clearly =
seems to be the main influence, and there's a total bulldozer effect to =
the way that the entire thing comes together. There are a couple of little =
tricks here and there to keep your ear interested... a couple of lead =
guitar parts, some catchy little stops and starts... but at the end of the =
day this is just bruising hardcore... if that's what you want to hear I'd =
recommend you pick this up.<br><br>

Ausmuteants: <i>Order of Operation</i> 12" (Goner)<br>
So there have been a whole slew of new Ausmuteants releases that have come =
out in the past few weeks / months (presumably in concurrence with the =
band's US tour dates), and after a couple of delays we finally have the =
new full-length on Goner. If you're expecting something different from =
these guys you're probably going to be sorely disappointed, as this pretty =
much gives us more of the same energetic, synth-tastic punk that has =
appeared on all of their previous releases. It's kind of incredible that =
they've managed to write this many songs and maintain a consistent level =
of quality across all of their releases, but it's hard to argue that this =
new LP signifies any kind of appreciable dip in quality. The riffs and =
synth lines are still ridiculously catchy, the lyrics are still really =
dumb and fun, and the rhythm section still barrels forward with unmatched =
energy. I can imagine their releases seeming somewhat redundant at some =
point, but if you've worn out their first full-length like I have you'll =
be happy as a pig in slop just to have more.<br><br>

Razorheads: S/T 7" (Failure)<br>
After a standout cassette release here's the vinyl debut from NJ's =
Razorheads... this is a total, full-bore hardcore ripper. The label's =
description gives the usual reference points like Anti-Cimex, but I think =
this is really something different entirely. While there might be a bit of =
Discharge influence in the riffing, this is faster, tighter, and denser =
than most straight up d-beat bands and in places it's more akin to the =
complex, intricate kind of hardcore that Skem&auml;ta are doing. The =
production is also really abrasive, but more in a "noisy" way than a "raw" =
way if that makes sense... in this respect it kind of sounds more like =
more recent Japanese bands like D-Clone and Zyanose, but the song =
structures are a lot more linear and familiar. But, basically, if you're =
into the kind of heavy, well-played and well-recorded hardcore that comes =
out of Sweden and Japan you will love this... a real bruiser.<br><br>

PC Worship: <i>Social Rust</i> 12" (Dull Tools)<br>
Latest LP from this New York band, and I have to say after having tried =
several times before, I finally "get it." It's hard for me to gauge how =
much the outside world knows about PC Worship because their name looms so =
large in the world of Whatever Brains... they're frequent tourmates, and =
(along with Protomartyr) one of the few bands that Brains mastermind Rich =
dubs one of the "great current American rock bands." Well, basically if =
you're the kind of person from whom a recommendation from the Whatever =
Brains camp carries any weight, you'll want to pick up this album right =
away. It's definitely on a similar tip... maybe a little more experimental =
and a little less poppy, but with a more straightforward and familiar =
vocal sound. Like the Brains, though, PC Worship share an affinity for =
making great rock songs out of unfamiliar rhythms and sonic textures, so =
if that's your bag this album is as epic and all-consuming a journey as =
you're likely to find.<br><br>

Dia Final: demo cassette (self-released)<br>
Demo cassette from this new band featuring a bunch of veterans of the Los =
Angeles punk scene. This is an absolutely explosive demo cassette... the =
music is built around pretty simple 1-2 drumming and strong and simple =
punk riffs, but something about the performance here just jumps out of the =
speakers. It definitely bears a little bit of resemblance to the whole =
Ruleta Rusa / Peligro Social style, but the production is much more raw, =
the vocals have more of a kind of snotty, '77 flavor that recalls bands =
like the Stitches, and the music is much more straightforward and =
stripped-down. Dia Final definitely aren't reinventing the wheel, but with =
this style either you sound explosive or you don't, and this one will =
knock you on your ass.<br><br>

Institute: <i>Salt</i> 12" (Sacred Bones)<br>
Brand new 12" from this Austin, TX punk band, and as you can expect =
there's a slight uptick in production quality now that they've moved to =
Sacred Bones. However, this doesn't mean so much that the production is =
"better," but rather than that it's even more spot-on in terms of =
replicating the sound of Institute's clear influences. Seriously, there =
are moments on this record where I have to honestly ask myself, "did I put =
on the Zounds LP by mistake?" The lead guitar tone is literally almost an =
exact match. I'm sure that some people will dismiss them as a soundalike =
band, but
I really like Institute, and I think this is easily their strongest =
material yet... the clearer production really serves them well, and the =
lead guitar lines in particular here are just absolutely infectious. It =
seems like lots of bands lay claim to a Crisis / Zounds influence, but =
it's really striking how much Institute sound like those bands, and =
honestly the music is of just as high quality. I've been playing this over =
and over since we got it in and I don't think it's going to leave the =
turntable any time soon.<br><br>

Pura Mania: <i>Musica Para Genta Fea</i> 7" (CV)<br>
Pura Mania: <i>La Estafa Musical</i> 7" (CV)<br>
So, even though these are two separate releases, I'm going to write one =
description to cover both... these appear to have been recorded at the =
same session, and the concurrent release time and similar artwork seem to =
imply that they are meant to be considered together. Now that I have that =
out of the way I can say GET BOTH OF THESE RECORDS RIGHT NOW!!!! =
Seriously, I can't remember the last time I've fallen this head over heels =
for a band. Pura Mania have one of the most original, exciting sounds I've =
heard in ages... a slightly quirky but utterly unique combination of =
melodic 80s Spanish punk like Eskorbuto, tough hardcore, oi!, and a little =
dash of new wave. I know that "description" isn't very descriptive at all, =
but Pura Mania are a very difficult band to pin down... the vocals and the =
drums are very simple, straightforward, and tough, but on their best songs =
like "Musica Para Genta Fea," the guitars and bass go off in a completely =
different direction, recalling the dynamic interplay of post-punk / new =
wave greats like Wire and Magazine. Basically, it's like Pura Mania have =
made this band explicitly to appeal to my personal tastes, simultaneously =
tickling the parts of my brain that crave tough hardcore and oi!, simple =
and catchy melodies, and the interesting instrumental dynamics of =
post-punk. It's crazy that Pura Mania are this relentlessly good, but =
nothing about the packaging or presentation really screams "this is some =
next-level shit." It's doubtful that these guys will become the next big =
thing or that anyone will think you're cooler for owning these records =
(except for me!), but those in the know will insist that these are two of =
the best records to be released in the year 2014. Utterly, utterly =
essential... highest possible recommendation!<br><br>

Desperfecto: Demo 2013 cassette	(CV)<br>
Demo tape from this punk band out of Santiago, Chile. These (mostly) =
ladies play raw, rudimentary, and catchy punk rock... I'm reminded more =
than a little bit of Cocadictos, but Desperfecto are a little more basic =
and not quite as explosive. If you dig raw, straightforward, and catchy =
lady-fronted punk like Vice Squad or Violators, or the amped-up sound of =
catchy Spanish punk like Vulpess this is well worth checking out.<br><br>

Makarra: <i>Mierda de Hardkore</i> cassette	(CV)<br>
Killer demo from this band out of Lima, Peru. This is so weird, raw, =
primitive, and awesome that I can't really get over it. I was listening to =
it earlier today (for like the 5th time in a row... it's that good) and my =
friend Sean was like, "is this a weird Wipers demo or something?" which is =
something I never really would have thought of because I'd imagine the =
band probably thinks of themselves more in the lineage of bands like =
Sarcofago, Hellhammer, and Venom... i.e. tough, raw metal bands, but it =
does have this strange hypnotic quality that definitely recalls the =
Wipers. I'm also reminded a bit of GISM, though without Randy Uchida's =
distinctive leads... instead, Makarra have more of that strange haunting =
quality that GISM captured so well. I probably don't have the expertise in =
the history of metal to describe this accurately, but rest assured it is =
completely freaking awesome... definitely recommended if you're into any =
of the aforementioned bands.<br><br>

Ausmuteants: <i>Fed Through a Tube</i> 7" (Total Punk)<br>
Latest single from this great Australian band, released just in time for =
their recent US tour. If you haven't heard Ausmuteants yet, they play =
completely infectious, high-energy new wave-infused punk. They kind of =
remind me of the Spits in that they have that constant =
16th-notes-on-the-hi-hats thing as well as some catchy synths, and their =
songwriting is of the "Ramones on 45RPM" school. Really, what's not to =
like? It's simple, catchy, maybe even slightly dumb punk rock, and if =
that's your style (i.e. you buy releases on Total Punk Records) you really =
need this one as well.<br><br>

P.I.G.Z.: <i>Bloody Belgium</i> 7" (Ugly Pop)<br>
Another month goes by and Ugly Pop reissues another shit-rare first-gen =
punker... how does Simon do it? This time around it's the sole single by =
Belgium's P.I.G.Z. from 1978. This is an energetic, stomping and =
straightforward punk single that reminds me a lot of the UK stuff that was =
starting in 1978 and 1979 as the second wave of punk got underway. There's =
a slight rock and roll edge to the riffing that almost makes this sound =
Australian, particularly on the standout track, "Stooges." A few of these =
songs have been comped, but this legit reissue is the only way you're =
going to hear all three, and as with all of Ugly Pop's reissues you get a =
beautiful reproduction of the original packaging and a bunch of extras as =
well, in this case a 12-page, 7"-inch-sized booklet that features an essay =
about the band and record from Simon and a number of vintage press =
clippings.<br><br>

X: <i>X-Aspirations</i> 12" (Ugly Pop)<br>
Reissue of the killer first album by this first-gen Australian punk band =
on the great Ugly Pop label. As we've come to expect from Ugly Pop, all of =
the packaging, artwork, liner notes, and mastering are all top-notch and =
definitely the next best thing to owning an original copy. This LP has =
long been a personal favorite of mine... it's a very weird record... =
undeniably punk, but also undeniably something else as well. Even though =
they're from Australia, on this record I'm reminded less of the amped-up, =
Stooges-influenced sound of bands like Radio Birdman and the Saints and =
more of groups that kind of got lumped in with punk but weren't really... =
bands like the Stranglers and Wire, as well as first-gen post-punks like =
Gang of Four and the Pop Group. While those references may make it seem as =
if X are more post- than punk, <i>X-Aspirations</i> is an energetic, even =
explosive record... it's just one with a ambition and dynamics that are =
beyond those of the typical punk band. So yeah, basically, this is a great =
album and even the 90s reissue is hard to come by these days, so there's =
no reason not to add this excellent reissue to your collection.<br><br>

X: <i>X-Spurts: The 1977 Demos</i> 12" (Ugly Pop)<br>
First time on vinyl for this rare 1977 demo session by the Australian band =
X (not to be confused, of course, with the band from Los Angeles with the =
same name). Apparently this recording session was thought to be completely =
lost, but was only recently recovered on an old, battered cassette tape. I =
went into this thinking that it was probably going to just be some demo =
recordings that the band made in advance of their great debut record, =
<i>X-Aspirations</i> (also recently reissued by Ugly Pop), but it turns =
out this is a completely different record that captures a completely =
different era of the band (only one track, "Revolution," appears on both =
<i>X-Spurts</i> and <i>X-Aspirations</i>). This earlier version had a =
completely different lineup (I believe there was only one member who =
played on both sessions), and has a lot more of the muscular and melodic, =
Stooges-inspired propulsion that I associate with early Australian punk =
than <I>X-Aspirations</i>, which is an incredible album but much more =
dynamic, minimal, and with more of a post-punk flair. <i>X-Spurts</i>, =
however, is balls-to-the-wall rock and roll, and if you dig records like =
the Saints' <i>Eternally Yours</i>, Radio Birdman's two LPs, or comparable =
British bands like Slaughter & the Dogs or the Damned then you will want =
to hear this. It also contains a large, 12"x24" lyric insert with a bunch =
of photos and a ton of liner notes providing contextual information about =
the album. Totally essential.<br><br>

Various: <i>Easier Said than Done</i> cassette (self-released)<br>

toward remedying that. While there is some diversity here, a majority of =
the bands play dark and straightforward hardcore. I wouldn't say there's =
something so distinctive as a "Philadelphia sound," but the bands all =

with a gnarly, aggressive woman on vocals. It kind reminds me of =
meat-and-potatoes Bay Area groups like Look Back and Laugh or Replica, but =

Breakout: <i>True Crime</i> 7" (Grave Mistake)<br>
2nd EP (the first one was self-released) from this Texas band. For some =
reason I was thinking that a band called Breakout was going to sound like =
NYHC or something, but this EP is really incredible, and sounds nothing =
like that at all... there's definitely a hardcore element (as you might =
expect from Grave Mistake), but there's a lot of stranger stuff happening =
as well. There's a lot of interesting interplay between the instruments =
that kind of reminds me of their fellow Texans Institute, but much harder, =
denser, and more intense. The label description actually mentions the Ruts =
(one of my favorite bands), and I can totally hear that on the standout =
track, "All's Quiet," which sounds kind of like a combination of the Ruts =
and Zounds. It's really refreshing to hear a band incorporate those =
influences without sounding like a total tribute band (which Institute are =
occasionally guilty of), and at the end of the day I can't really think of =
another band that Breakout sound like, and in my book there's really no =
higher compliment for a hardcore punk record.<br><br>

The #1s: S/T 12" (Deranged)<br>
After what seems like quite a bit of delay, the vinyl for the #1s debut =
12" is out! I put out their previous single so it's no secret that I =
absolutely adore this band, and I've been listening to this LP quite a =
bit. I have to admit that when I first got it I was a little disappointed =
that there wasn't more new material (it includes all three tracks from the =
"Sharon" single that I put out as well as several tracks from their =
previous EP and demo), but at the end of the day it's nice to have it all =
in one place (particularly for those of you who weren't lucky to grab the =
super hard to find first EP), and even one new track by this band would =
make a record worth getting. Oh, and if you haven't heard the #1s, they =
play upbeat, infectious power-pop in the tradition of bands like Protex =
and the Exploding Hearts, and for my money there is no one on the planet =
doing it better at the moment.<br><br>

Cardiac Arrest: <i>In the Mouth of Madness</i> 12" (Lumpy)<br>
I don't think that many people expected a new Cardiac Arrest LP in the =
year 2014, but here it is! It seems like not a lot of people knew they =
were still active, but I guess they've been plugging away in St. Louis =
chipping away at writing this full-length. As you might expect from a band =
that's been around for a decade by now, this definitely shows some =
development from their earlier stuff, but all in all the formula hasn't =
really changed... it's still blistering, balls-to-the-wall hardcore with =
Rob's trademark menacing yet catchy vocal style. Their two EPs were total =
gut punches, but you can tell that a lot of thought and work went into the =
LP as there's a lot of attention to pacing and sequencing to make sure you =
keep flipping this again and again. The production is also fantastic... =
straightforward and dry but punchy as hell. Basically, if you're still =
interested in this kind of early 80s-inspired USHC you're going to want to =

Ausmuteants: <i>Power Hour Value Pack</i> cassette (Lumpy)<br>
I could be wrong, but I think that this might be the first time Lumpy has =
expanded his purview outside of his native great St. Louis area, and boy =
does he go worldwide with a bang, collecting 32 unreleased and demo tracks =
from Australia's Ausmuteants in time for their US tour. While there's some =
pretty straightforward Ausmuteants stuff on here, judging by the sound and =
instrumentation it sounds like a lot of these tracks are home demos that =
were recorded by band members individually as part of the songwriting =
process... I love this kind of thing as comparing these to the ultimately =
released versions is an interesting window into how they put these songs =
together. Regardless, if you're an Ausmuteants fan you'll want this, and =
you can beat it at 32 tracks for a few bucks...<br><br>

Weed Hounds: S/T 12" (Katorga Works)<br>
It's funny, I don't think I'd actually heard Weed Hounds' music before, =
but I knew their name because they were kind of a running joke in Katorga =
Works emails... I think Adam's been saying "Weed Hounds LP will be out =
soon" for several years now. Not having any idea what these guys actually =
sound like I was pleasantly surprised by some great, kind of shoegaze-y =
indie-pop. It's definitely more toward the Merchandise end of the Katorga =
Works catalog, but the band that Weed Hounds really remind me of is =
Siamese Twins... just like the Twins, their music seems to come to the =
listener through a kind of dense, hazy filter. For a lot of bands that =
sheen of noise is the beginning and end of their sound, but Weed Hounds =
have more than enough melody and songwriting skill that bubbles up to the =
surface and keeps things interesting. Just like their punk stuff, when =
Katorga Works puts out a more indie-ish release like this you know it's =
going to be top-notch. Definitely recommended if you like the =
aforementioned bands.<br><br>

Nerv: <i>Off Earth Now</i> 7" (Lagerville)<br>
Brand new 7" from this band out of Iowa. Their previous 7" was a store =
favorite... a totally unique blast of pure Midwestern hardcore a la Die =
Kreuzen or Mecht Mensch. While that's still the foundation here, things =
are a little bit different this time around. First of all, the production =
is a lot more dense, compressed, and disorienting... it's one of those =
recordings that sounds like the music is being beamed directly into your =
brain stem rather than like you're listening to an actual band, and while =
that may sound like a bad thing it actually fits this band's style of =
quirky hardcore quite well. Fans of Nasa Space Universe take note as this =
band are on a similar trip, though it's a little bit less "out there" and =
a little more in line with the classic USHC sound.<br><br>

Generacion Suicida: <i>Todo Terminida</i> 12" (Going Underground)<Br>
Brand new 12" EP from this LA-area band. When Generacion Suicida started =
it was clear that they had a major fascination with the X-on-downers sound =
of Masshysteri and their earlier stuff felt (to me at least) like a =
scrappier, more DIY take on that sound. While that's still a big element =
of their sound here, things have evolved a bit, and for the better. First =
of all (and I don't have any of their other records handy to check), but I =
don't remember this band having such a sick bass player... whoever is =
playing bass is just all over the place, laying down this constant, fluid =
stream of 16th-notes that pull the songs in these great, Eskorbuto-esque =
melodic directions while the guitars and vocals chug along at a more =
straightforward punk pace. The slight disjunction between these elements =
of the band's sound really drives things forward and keeps it very =
interesting throughout, and of course since the core of their sound is =
very melodic the whole thing is very catchy and memorable. While I know =
this band gets kind of pegged as a Masshysteri-influenced band, the songs =
on this record are almost exclusively blistering fast and melodic, almost =
sounding in places like a kind of melancholic take on pogo punk. It's a =
weird combination, but totally unique and killer.<br><br>

Sick Thoughts: <i>Coming Over</i> 7" (Going Underground)<Br>
Latest 7" from this one-man project out of Baltimore. I think I've carried =
just about all of Drew's records up to this point and they've definitely =
gotten a lot better... I remember getting a very angry email from him a =
few months ago complaining that my descriptions of his records painted him =
as nothing more than a Reatards ripoff. I think the evidence kind of =
speaks for itself on those early records (not that they're not great, =
they're just heavily indebted to the Reatards), but he's definitely be =
onto some different shit lately. This new stuff has much more of a KBD =
feel with a seriously warped guitar sound and a much more riff-oriented, =
song-y approach that's way more memorable than anything he's done. =
Everything is catchier, wilder, and ultimately more memorable... I'd stack =
these three rippers up against any neo-KBD band and it would blow 99% of =
it away... I can't think of another group doing a more authentically raw =
and wild take on the KBD sound, so if you're a fan of those old comps or =
of raw, wild garage rock like Teengenerate this is one you'll definitely =
need to add to your pile.<br><br>

Urbanoia: <i>Psykisk Terror</i> 7" (Solar Funeral)<br>
2nd EP from this raging Norweigan hardcore band on the great Solar Funeral =
label. You can always count on SF to put out above-the-bar hardcore (and =
they're even releasing the next Skem&auml;ta 7"!), and this EP is no =
different. This 4-song EP is very short (about 4 minutes in total), but =
you shouldn't hold the band's economy against them... this is =
straightforward, pounding, and well-produced hardcore in the tradition of =
Norweigan bands like Svart Framtid, Headcleaners, and Akutt Innleggelse... =
no guitar solos, no fake "raw punk" vibe, just straight up hardcore. If =
that's your style then this one is pretty much essential.<br><br>

Fashionable Activism #3 zine<br>
Third issue if this punk fanzine, and it's pretty much a complete reboot =
in terms of both aesthetics and content. The editor moved from Minneapolis =
to Austin, TX and completed a design degree, and according to the preface =
he's decided to be much more deliberate about the zine's aesthetic, =
working hard to avoid common and cliche visual tropes, and the content of =
the zine is also more focused on design rather than just music. This time =
around you get interviews with Laura Pallmall of Blotter, the artist =
Elijah Funk, and the St. Louis band Black Panties. I really hope that =
Kevin continues on this path as it seems like a really good direction, and =
it's rare these days to see a real "punk" fanzine that actually wants to =
be more than just another punk fanzine.<br><br>
