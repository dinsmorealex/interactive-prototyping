Hello, List!
Here are the listings as of Oct 01, 2014.


Listings Project Story of the Week:

I was sure that if I saw something here, it would be gone before I could =
pick up the phone since so many of my friends lucked out and I figured th=
e word was out. But I was pleasantly surprised to hear back and get into =
my new digs in Crown Heights. I hope the scale of the list is forever bal=
anced so that readers can find great finds in just a few weeks when they'=
re looking.Thanks! -James


Best,
Stephanie

ailable!
Available: Aug 01, 2014

To anyone looking for a great new studio space to work in, I have been as=
ked to refer you to a new art studio project. I've had my studio in the s=
ame building for many years now, and it truly is a wonderful place to wor=
k!=20

Because it's a brand new build out, there are many different spaces avail=
able. The prices begin at $1025-$1350 for the medium-large ones. All have=
 massive windows, and and are perfect size for sharing.

And then there are the truly enormous spaces with FAR more space and even=
 more windows. These range anywhere from $1400 - $4000.=20

Each space will have plenty of light and ventilation, as well as a heat a=
nd AC unit in every space. The building also provides gorgeous rooftop vi=
ews, 24 hour access and security, and an enormous loading dock and freigh=
t elevator.=20

For those not familiar with the area, it's generally thought of as a safe=
, quiet Brooklyn neighborhood. The building is just a few blocks from the=
 G train, with plenty of food options and easy street parking.

I have had my own art studio in this building for almost 4 years, and the=
 management has asked me to help get interest in the new spaces as they a=
re expanding the number of studios in the building. I will be the one sho=
wing the spaces and there are absolutely NO fees involved.

If you're interested, please text Jordan. I look forward to hearing from =
you. Thanks!

$790.00 Per Month, Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, 180 sq. ft., Clean, Calm and Frien=
dly Queer Household
Available: Oct 01, 2014 through Nov 01, 2015

We are looking for a long-term roommate in our Bed-Stuy apartment. The ro=
om is available as early as October 1st, and needs to be filled by Novemb=
er 1st. Our lease will be renewed on November 1st, and if youre intereste=
d you could join the lease then. We will be giving some preferential cons=
ideration to those who are able to join the lease, but are also open to l=
ong-term renters who can verbally commit to a year.
=20
About the apartment and neighborhood:
-Located in Bed-Stuy on Throop ave at Jefferson ave
-Fourth floor walk up on the top floor of a medium-sized pre-war building=
 (unfortunately, the building is not accessible)
-3bed/1bath with kitchen and living room
-Open floor plan with hardwood floors, high ceilings, and lots of light
-Includes roof access and access to basement bike storage
- The house is dog friendly for the right dog, but no cats. (There is a l=
ittle dog that hangs out here sometime, but doesnt live here permanently.=
)
-About a 7 minute walk to the Kingston-Throop C, a 12 minute walk to the =
Nostrand A/C, close to the B26/B43/B52/B44 and bike path=20
=20
About the available room:
-The biggest of the three: about 12x15
-1 window, 1 large closet with shelf
-Rent is $790/mo with a security deposit of $790, making the total amount=
 to move in $1580
-Utilities (electric, gas, internet) typically run about $40-$50/mo each
=20
About your roommates:
S: Early thirties, uses she/her pronouns. I've been living in Brooklyn fo=
r 7 years and I work full-time in the restaurant/urban farming industry. =
I enjoy cooking, brewing beer, and crafting - and really enjoy sharing th=
e results of these hobbies with others.

F: Late twenties, trans*-androgynous, uses they/them pronouns. Ive lived =
in Brooklyn for about 5 years. Im a writer/artist and work part-time as a=
 tutor and other freelance jobs. I like cooking and sharing occasional me=
als.
=20
About our ideal roommate:
-Is an honest communicator
-Is able to pay rent and bills on time
-Cleans up after themselves without a need for direction: we are cleaner =
than average but don't do chore wheels.
-Interested in a long-term living situation
-Would be okay living with meat-eaters: we both like to cook and consume =
meat in the household, though we are happy to be accommodating to someone=
 who doesn't.
-Social with other roommates: we do our own thing, but also like spending=
 time together and chatting over a drink or meal on the regular. We both =
value privacy and alone time, but if you're someone who doesn't engage wi=
th your roommates much, this probably isn't the best place for you.
-Conscious of our position as gentrifiers of Bed-Stuy: we love living her=
e, but are aware of the implications of gentrification and the role we pl=
ay in it. We strive to be respectful of our neighborhood and the folks wh=
o live here, and our third roommate - should they also be actively engagi=
ng in the gentrification of central Brooklyn - would need to strive to re=
spect the history of the neighborhood and their position in it.
-Doesnt have a live-in partner: we are super down with dates/sweeties/fri=
ends spending the night, but are not looking to live with a couple.=20
-sex-positive/body-positive/anti-oppression/queer+trans-friendly, and all=
 of that good stuff.
-Basically we're into softies. We click best with feminist and/or queer f=
emme/female-id/trans* people. Wouldn't be opposed to a sweet male-assigne=
d/id'ed person, but self-assess yr feminist vibes before you write us.=20=


Have you read all of this and are excited about the possibility? We'd lov=
e to hear about you and find a time for you to come by and check out the =
place. Please email in response to this ad with some info about yourself,=
 what you're looking for, and when you are typically available to meet.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

cery store. It is a 5-10 min walk to the AC2345S trains.=20

As you can see, this place has it all!! It really feels like a home.=20

Who I am:=20
I'm a 22 year old Fine Arts student. I love art, writing, reading, and po=
litical theory/philosophy. I love nature and am super into sustainability=
, so building up the garden and supporting the local farmers is very impo=
rtant to me. I want the house to feel very airy :) I'm very creative and =
friendly, and value kindness and trust.

Who you are:
Preferably a young creative professional or student in the creative field=
 (writers, artists, etc). You also value sustainability and want to help =
make our home green. You would like to cook together on occasion, and han=
g out from time to time (so not a total hermit aha). You are trustworthy,=
 thoughtful and pay your rent on time!=20

Being young, I obviously don't mind the occasional party but don't want i=
t to be a party house. I really want a space that feels peaceful, stimula=
ting and relaxing. Let's make it a sanctuary!! :). Like I said above, I w=
ould be interested in making the dining room a studio space, so you would=
 have to be into that idea as well - we can share it :).=20

Also, I have some furniture but I really want to do the majority furnishi=
ng together.=20

If this sounds like you, message me back and we can meet up and go from t=
here.=20
Leah

P.S. - The images have the current decor of the home owners. They really =
don't do the place justice. Our place would be empty when we move in!

$1,250.00 Per Month, Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, 145 sq. ft., Lovely, lar=
ge, quiet room in charming Slope/Heights 2BR, F only
Available: Nov 01, 2014

Hi there! My current roommate is leaving so I have a wonderful bedroom av=
ailable in my 2br in Prospect Heights for a mature, clean, easygoing fema=
le who works full time. The apartment is in a row house, the only one on =
the second floor (only 2 other apts in the building!). The room is large =
(about 11 x 13) with space for a double/queen bed, desk, dresser, nightst=
ands, etc. Decent-sized closet. 2 windows overlooking back garden.

The rest of the apartment consists of living room full of vintage Danish/=
mid-century furniture, work area, and separate eat-in kitchen with plenty=
 of counter space and cabinets. Great if you love to cook!

I am a writer who teaches at Pratt Institute, and I also freelance as a w=
riter/copy editor for several well-known book publishers. My schedule ten=
ds to change, and I do spend a considerable amount of time working from h=
ome. So, ideally, you will have a regular, full-time day job.

I am in my mid-40s, clean, sane, responsible, outgoing, friendly, and fun=
ny...but like space and quiet time and will respect your need for the sam=
e. I'm not really a neat freak, but do keep the place clean, especially t=
he kitchen and bathroom. I have a fat, sweet, adorable cat named Cecil. (=
Cat lovers welcome and preferred!) AND...it should probably go without sa=
ying, but no drugs/partying/heavy drinking, etc. If you are looking for a=
 comfy, cozy, warm and pleasant home (not a crash pad), this is your plac=
e. This is a co-signing arrangement, so you must qualify with my landlord=
 (who is very nice and reasonable) in terms of income and credit. Please =
note: I strongly prefer to live with someone over 30. (No offense if you'=
re in your 20s...I have tons of younger friends, just don't want to live =
with any of them.) :)

The room for rent is unfurnished, so you will have to provide your own. H=
eat/gas is included. Remaining bills (including wi-fi) generally total ar=
ound $75 a month each.

What else? This is a fantastic neighborhood. Tree-lined, pretty, safe, an=
d convenient to everything. 5 minute walk to 2/3 at Bergen or Q/B at 7th =
ave. Tons of great shops, cafes, bars. 10/15 minutes walk to Ft Greene, P=
rospect Park, 5-10 minutes to Park Slope.

Please get in touch with a little about yourself if interested. I can sho=
w the room  evenings during the week. Thanks for reading, and I look forw=
ard to meeting you! ~~Holly

lives without infringing on the personal space or comfort of our roommate=

$700.00 Per Month, Sunnyside, Queens, Looking for 1 roommate in a charmin=
g 2 bedroom in Sunnyside
Available: Nov 01, 2014

I'm looking for a roommate starting November 1st in a 2 bedroom apartment=
 in Sunnyside. It's currently occupied by two friends of mine who will be=
 leaving at the end of October.

The apartment is located in the southeast area of Sunnyside on 50th avenu=
e. It's a great, quiet little neighborhood with tree-lined streets. Just =
a few blocks from the 7 train, walking distance to Greenpoint, close to g=
rocery stores and laundromat.=20

The apartment is a 2nd floor walk up. Both bedrooms are quite large and h=
ave plenty of closet space.  The kitchen and bathroom are a good size. Th=
ere is no common area in the apartment; however, I think with a little cr=
eativity the kitchen could be made into a comfy hangout spot.

A little about myself - I'm a 27 year old female who works in the food in=
dustry (but I work 9-5 hours). I'm a clean, quiet, respectful roommate an=
d I'm hoping to find the same! I'm also a musician, but I don't play in t=
he apartment. Because of the lack of common space I'm looking for someone=
 who doesn't bring the party home. =20

Rent is $700 a month plus utilities (gas/electric/internet), plus a $700 =
security deposit, so $1400 to move in. It's month-to-month, so you will n=
ot be signing a year lease, however I am only looking for someone long te=
rm.  You must have a steady job and proof of income. NO pets, sorry! I wi=
ll be showing this weekend, please email to set up a time to come and see=
 it. Thank you!

$1,200.00 Per Month, Sunset Park, Brooklyn, Roommate wanted for House Sha=
re (!!!)  in Sunset Park!
Available: Nov 01, 2014

Want to be in a house? With a driveway? And your own balcony? How about w=
asher/dryer, dishwasher, backyard, and shared bathroom?! Then keep readin=
g!!!!

Hi!=20

My roommates and I are looking for an awesome fourth roommate to share ou=
r entire house in Sunset Park Brooklyn! See below for info and click on t=
he link for photos, hope to hear from you!

About the House
When we say house we mean it! This is a three-floor, plus basement, free =
standing home. We have central air and heat and here's the description of=
 all of it! There will also be an extra spot in the driveway for a car if=
 you happen to have one and need to park it! :)=20

The basement is finished (see photo from when we moved in, please note th=
e back room in the picture is now made up as a guest room) and has a grea=
t guest room with its own bathroom that we all use for friends and family=
 visiting town or, if you want to use parts of the basement for an office=
 or studio sometimes we can discuss that as well. The basement also has a=
 great large space for a yoga or for art or any other things you can thin=
k of!

Ok, first floor: The first floor has a living room with a couch, small ta=
ble and chairs, and another larger table by the front window. It;s a grea=
t big place to have dinner parties or what have you. The kitchen has all =
new appliances, washer/dryer and dish washer(!!!) and chef's stove. That =
all opens out to our backyard with small porch and garden that could defi=
nitely use more tlc if you are into gardening! We have a BBQ grill and ho=
st some grilling during the summer.=20

your room, is on the second floor and is the smaller of the two rooms on =
that floor. It is the photo of the empty room, from when we first moved i=
n. Currently our roommate in there has a queen bed, desk, bookshelf and s=
mall bench in there so it is still a great size. It has a large closet an=
d small balcony(!!!) Check out the picture of the front of the house, you=
 can see the balcony there. The second floor has a bathroom that we share=
.=20

About Your Roommates!
Your potential future roommates are Mike and Mindy (who are married and l=
ive in the master bedroom) and Lauren who lives on the third floor and is=
 on the lease. We've all lived here for over two years and have a really =
awesome dynamic. We are social justice minded lawyers (lauren runs a nonp=
rofit ten blocks away) who also enjoy board games, cooking, exploring nyc=
 and goofing with Lauren's two cats muffin and pumpkin (yes we have two c=
ats!) We have our own spaces but enjoy sharing a drink together at night =
or chatting over dinner. We like having kind of a community type house wh=
ere we help each other out if we're running to the store but keep separat=
e shelves and cabinets for food. We have and do chores but also hire a re=
ally cool cooperative cleaning company to do the common areas once a mont=
h.=20

About the Neighborhood
We love our location as well, we are located right between sunset park an=
d south park slope in an area known as &quot;Greenwood Heights.&quot; We =
are three blocks from the N/D express trains (two stops into manhattan!) =
and the R local train at 36th street. Sunset park is a fantastically dive=
rse area featuring the best view of the NYC skyline in the park just 8 bl=
ocks away. It also has amazing mexican food, great coffee shops, a retro =
bowling alley, and is a hop skip and a jump from Brooklyn's chinatown wit=
h the best hot pot outside of ChongQing.
To the north is south park slope and a bus across from the apartment (the=
 b63) will take you directly into all the wonders that park slope has to =
offer. Truly we love it here and we hope you do too!

About You
You are a respectful no drama easy to get along with individual who wants=
 to be a part of a house that's not over the top cooperative but is a sma=
ll group of people who want to make a home. You are chill but clean up af=
ter yourself and have lived with roommates before and it worked! No smoke=
rs or hard drugs and sadly our cats would freak out if another was added =
so sadly, we can't take anymore cats or other pets (unless maybe you have=
 an iguana :)) and, due to sensitive allergies, we can't have someone tha=
t uses air fresheners in the room. We'd prefer a professional who works a=
way from home unless you are interested in renting out the basement for p=
art of your office or studio. looking so forward to meeting you, future r=
oomie!!=20

Rent
$1200 a month plus utilities, wifi, etc.=20

If interested
Please send us an email with a little about yourself, what you're looking=
 for, and your favorite board game

$700.00 Per Month, Lefferts Garden, Brooklyn, Junior bedroom in Lefferts =
Garden
Available: Oct 12, 2014

Beautiful people!

I am heading to Florida to start a film festival and practice my art. So,=
 there is now a junior bedroom open in a three-bedroom light-filled spaci=
ous apartment in Lefferts Garden.=20

We are an eight-minute walk to Prospect Park and a 7-minute walk to the 2=
/5 Sterling Train and the B/Q Prospect Park Train (20 minutes to Union Sq=
uare). We are also a short walk to the Brooklyn Botanical Garden, Prospec=
t Park Zoo, and the Brooklyn Museum. A short bike ride gets you to the ma=
in branch of the Brooklyn Library.=20

The room is a small 6' x 9' plus a closet, but there is plenty of common =
space. Also, there is an alcove right outside the bedroom door where you =
can place a dresser. I am including a full-size bed and an air conditioni=
ng unit at no additional charge.=20

The room will be showing between 6:30p and 8:30p this Wednesday (10/1) an=
d Thursday (10/2). It may be possible to meet me and view the apartment a=
t 9a sharp on Saturday or Sunday, but a separate appointment to meet all =
the roommates on the following Monday (10/6) night would need to be made.=
 My time is limited, so I can only accomodate one viewing on the Saturday=
 and Sunday. Also, we would prefer to make a decision by this Friday, so =
you would be in a better position to see it Wednesday or Thursday.

My current roommates are two professional women in their 30s. One works i=
n publishing and is a writer (and serious knitter) and the other works at=
 a super awesome school.=20

Seriously, both women are the best roommates I have had in the seven year=
s that I have lived in NYC.=20

There are only two apartments in the building and the landlords (a lovely=
 older married couple) lives in the other. They are super sweet!!!

We all live separate lives, but you must be friendly and play well with o=
thers. This is a blissful, drug free house.=20

Rent is $700 and the security is $700 (paid directly to the landlord, who=
 you will meet). The utilities usually run between $40 - $47.

Also, rent is due the 15th of each month. You can move in as early as the=
 afternoon of October 12th (you get a few days free), since I am leaving =
the city that morning. However, the rent for October must be paid for no =
later than by October 15th.=20

Please be ready to provide security no later than Friday, October 3rd.=20=


We are looking for someone who wants to stay for a while (at least a year=
).=20

Please tell us about yourself (hobbies, interest, routine, etc.), so we c=
an see if everyone might work well together.

Sorry, no couples.=20

Also, for you bikers out there, you can lock your bike in the front yard.=
 We also have bike lanes all over the place.

$3,900.00 Per Month, East Village, New York, 970 sq. ft., &quot;Technicol=
or&quot; apartment: available 2 to 3 months: your choice
Available: Oct 10, 2014 through Dec 31, 2014

I'm on the 3rd floor of a remodeled building that dates to 1897.
If you're a design aficionado and appreciate technology, you'll love this=
 spacious, incredibly quiet apartment. To repaint it, I studied 3 Technic=
olor films from the 40s and 50s and painted each room with very saturated=
 colors, except the small bedroom, which is all white. Then I installed a=
 new floor and had my 3 best pieces of furniture recovered. Finally, I in=
stalled a Hue lighting system that can be controlled by your iPhone or a =
remote. You can read about the apartment and see photos of it in the Euro=
pean design magazine &quot;Apartamento.&quot;

Note: This bedroom is most suitable for 1 to 3 people (3, if 2 of them ar=
e part of a couple). It's not a particularly &quot;child-safe&quot; apart=
ment (too many fragile things), so I don't recommend it for small childre=
n.

Amenities:
living room=20
large kitchen=20
large dining room area=20
2 bedrooms=20
laundry alcove=20
blue-tiled bathroom=20
enormous walk-in shower
new floor
dishwasher=20
washing machine=20
dryer=20
Fios TV and Internet (included in price)
southern exposure
Only electricity is not included.
=20
I'm hoping to get out of New York for 2 to 3 months, and my dates are fle=
xible, as long as they don't start too late in the fall. At this point, m=
y leaving sometime between October 10 and 15 is ideal.
1 to 3 people
All questions answered. You may also visit if you're in town.

$1,800.00 Per Month, East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 700 sq. ft., Bright and=
 spacious railroad with lots of plants
Available: Nov 01, 2014 through Nov 30, 2014

Hi there,

I'm leaving town for November and looking for a nice, responsible person =
to sublet my very cute apartment.=20

The place is a large railroad walkup on the 2nd floor of a typical tename=
nt building in East Williamsburg. The apartment has four rooms (from back=
 to front): kitchen, dressing room/extra space, bedroom, living room. The=
 kitchen has all the tools to make a big meal, a clean fridge, some food =
storage and a nice dining table which pulls out to seat 6-8 people. The s=
mall bathroom with tub is located off the kitchen. The adjacent room has =
a closet and dresser and my flat file. Next is the bedroom which has a li=
ttle window cutout to get light and air from the living room plus a frenc=
h door for privacy. The living room is the best room in the house- it get=
s great light all day long, I have tons of records and books, the couch i=
s comfortable and pulls out to a full bed.=20

There are big, healthy plants all throughout the apartment which will req=
uire water and a little love while I'm gone so plant-friendly is a must! =
You don't need to be a green thumb though- just consistent and responsibl=
e.=20

There is fast wifi, good heat and hot water, nice and quiet neighbors. Th=
e L train at Graham Ave is about a 6 or 7 minute walk. It is a super quic=
k ride into Manhattan... I think Union Square takes tops 15 minutes. With=
in a 5-10 minute walk there are plenty of restaurants, coffee shops, groc=
eries, health food, wine shops, yoga, bars, etc. It's Williamsburg- you g=
et it. Also super convenient by any means of travel to get to Bedford Ave=
 area or Greenpoint for more of all that.=20

I would like to sublet for the entire month but I am slightly flexible. R=
ent is $1800/mo plus utilities.=20

$239,000.00, Pawtucket, Rhode Island, 2000 sq. ft., Unique live/work home=
 created from a former steam fitter's shop with lovely gardens.
Available: Oct 01, 2014

We are selling our live/work home in Pawtucket, Rhode Isalnd, just minute=
s from downtown Providence, Rhode Island School of Design and Brown campu=
ses, Hope Artist Village, farmer's markets and unique shopping and dining=
. There is parking for four cars, the bus stop is at the end of the block=
 and it is only minutes to commuter rail and Amtrak.

Over the past eight years we have transformed a former steam fitter's sho=
p into an ideal home and work space. It is currently configured as a one =
bedroom, two and a half bath home and studio, but it could easily accommo=
date additional bedrooms. The space could be reconfigured in a variety of=
 ways due to the open plan of the building.

Features of the property include two 7'x7' pyramid skylights, wood and re=
finished concrete floors, a new roof, windows and doors, french doors to =
a large patio, established perennial gardens including a privacy stand of=
 bamboo, stainless steel appliances, washer/dryer, and unique built-ins f=
rom the building's former life. A favorite item is an original 4'x10' woo=
d table that is the centerpiece of the studio space. There is a new 10'x1=
2' wood shed and all of this sits on a quarter acre lot.

$2,000.00 Per Month, Fort Greene / Clinton Hill / Prospect Heights, Brook=
lyn, Seeking 1 Bedroom Apt - Fort Greene / Clinton Hill: Very Flexible Mo=
ve-In Date
Available: Oct 01, 2014

Hello!

I hope this message finds you well.

My name is Sanae,=20

I'm a 32 year old single woman in search of a new home. I would love to b=
ecome your new tenant!

I've lived in my neighborhood for years and it's been over 4 months now t=
hat I've been searching for my new home. I'm really trying to stay in the=
 area and ideally, I need to move anytime before mid-October but can wait=
 for the right space.

I'm a gainfully employed creative, I can do just about anything with rega=
rds to aesthetic and design. This means if your space needs a little fixi=
ng up, or even a kitchen / bathroom renovation, I would be more than happ=
y to give it some love, its what I do best!

As a tenant I am very quiet and respectful of my space, neighbors, and co=
mmunity. I always pay my bills on time and truly make my space my home an=
d sanctuary. I work a lot and I do not smoke nor have any pets. My presen=
t landlord would be more than happy to give me a really great reference.

I know I'm looking for quite the needle or gem if you will in a haystack =
and I'm really trying to stay in my neighborhood (Fort Greene / Clinton H=
ill) but I'm open to going a little outwards south and west. Fortunately =
I have a lot flexibility with my move-in date, finding the right space is=
 most important to me.

I am looking for an unfurnished pre-war space for long term lease, I'm op=
en to lease take-overs as well.

I love original details and charm, I'm not concerned about renovations, I=
 would be more than happy to do them myself.

I am open to two room / alcove studios but I really think I need a true o=
ne bedroom to accommodate my furniture, I'm aware this will be a difficul=
t find.=20

I'm not looking for a basement/garden apartment.
I'm not looking for a share situation but a place of my own.=20
Thanks for taking the time to read this.=20

Warmest Regards-
Your Future Tenant
Sanae Marilia Ueyoshi xx

I've attached a photo of my present apartment to give an idea of my lifes=
tyle, present furniture situation, and perhaps what give an idea I'm look=
ing for in an apartment. I have some flexibility in my budget for the rig=
ht space that I can really commit to long term.

$1,900.00 Per Month, Manhattan/Brooklyn, New York, Seeking 1 bed apt/stud=
io for immediate move!
Available: Oct 05, 2014

Hello!

We are an Irish couple called Liz and Richard, we have recently moved to =
New York from Dublin. We're looking for a studio or 1 bed apartment as so=
on as possible! We're flexible about areas but would like to be based in =
Brooklyn or Manhattan, ideally about 30 mins max on the subway from Lower=
 Manhattan. Our budget is about $1500-1900 total per month. We're looking=
 at about a year so either month-to-month or a longer arrangement is fine=
.

Liz is a graphic designer who likes baking, would like to have a back yar=
d but would be happy just to live near a park.

Richard is a film maker and really into coffee, so a decent local cafe wo=
uld be a dream for him!

As we've just moved here we don't have furniture, so a furnished place wo=
uld be great but we're also happy to take unfurnished.

We're both clean, tidy, always pay our rent on time, conscientious tenant=
s and neighbours and friendly. We're pretty flexible on the location and =
type of accommodation so please, get in touch if you have anything that m=
ight suit us!

Thanks,

Liz and Richard
