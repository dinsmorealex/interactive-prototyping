Hello List-
Here are listings as of 10/24/12
Listings Project Story of the Week:

I fully expected to be thanking you for the renter but the peace of mind wa=
s more
valuable! I have just had a broker come in with someone who is taking the a=
pt. =20
They could have saved a lot of money with your service.  Thank you so much =
for your
fabulous listing!  It was the key to my mental health this last month when =
a renter
left a deposit then changed her mind without notice.  Your ad consistently =
brought
viable renters.  I am telling everyone looking about this great resource!

All the best,

Susan

ART STUDIOS FOR RENT

$1900 per month, Bushwick, 2400 square feet (1200 storefront, 1200  basemen=
t), Storefront,
North Windows, Convertible into Separate Studio  Spaces, bathroom, kitchen,=
 superintendent
Available: 11/01/12 through 11/01/13 extension possible
1200 sqft (20' x 60'), with 1200 sqft basement, Superintendent, 14'  ceilin=
gs, bathroom,
kitchen ready for gas stove hookup, basement  bathroom plumbing ready for h=
ookup.
North windows. Artists may paint,  subdivide.
Rent directly from owner, well maintained property. Heat not included.  Sor=
ry, no
live-ins. But small (550 sq ft) studio apartment above  storefront with 120=
0 sq=20
ft roofdeck garden becomes available in  December.
The space has been rented as a restaurant before, but would be suitable  as=
 studio
space or cafe/gallery.   The only fees are the rent,  utilities, and credit=
 check.
John is the owner, I am his assistant. There is no broker, and no broker fe=
es. =20
I am a visual artist.  He is a businessman.
"The roof of the warehouse is 1200 sq ft.  I've been pushing for an  urban =
garden
space, and the owner has finally agreed to building the  foundation (the de=
cking,
fencing, possibly the beds).  Since he  originally wanted to simply "build =
up" and
add another warehouse floor -  which would have created a cement wall for a=
ll surrounding
apartments  to look out onto - I consider it a great victory for the greeni=
ng of
  Bushwick, which had the lowest ratio of green space to square footage of =
 all=20
the neighborhoods in Brooklyn.  There's a small studio apartment  that over=
looks
 and has access to the garden space.....etc. continued as  you wrote
There's a small studio apartment that overlooks and has access to the  gard=
en space.
 I built my rooftop garden in part so that when I edit, I  am overlooking g=
reenery,
as opposed to the cement wall and rooftop that  was there when I moved in. =
 It calms
and inspires me, and vastly  improves my quality of life in the city.  From=
 the=20
perspective of a  painter who works long hours in studio then doesn't want =
to make
the  commute home, or cafe / gallery owner in same position, another option=
  for
 green use would be the storefront/cafe tenant renting the garden  space as=
 "locally
grown" or 'pick your own' veggies for the restaurant  meal, or an artist's =
dwelling
that's a 10 step commute from their  studio.
Basically, the spaces (warehouse, storefront, apartment) have the  potentia=
l to=20
work together as a very artist-supportive/green  environment. More and more=
 artists
are moving East to avoid rising  rents, so it seems to me the perfect use f=
or the
property.

$337.50 per month, Bushwick, 300 sq feet, Seeking fellow artist to share my=
 art=20
studio
Available: 10/23/12 through 11/1/13
I'm a painter looking for someone to share my awesome studio space. I  will=
 be signing
a second one year lease starting in November, looking  for someone who want=
s to=20
be on the lease too.
The space gets lots of natural light from two large windows. There is a  fi=
re escape
and roof access with gorgeous views. There are four other  artists' studios=
 on the
same floor, as well as a slop sink and lots of  wall space on the floor out=
side=20
our studio door for exhibiting work.  Additionally, a large open gallery sp=
ace is
being completed on the floor  below us, with two new bathrooms for artists'=
 use=20
(we currently use an  upstairs restroom). This space will be used for art  =
exhibitions/installations
by building artists.
All utilities including heat and A/C are included in the monthly rent of  $=
675,=20
divided between us ($337.50 each).  To share the space, you will  need firs=
t month's
rent, plus two months' rent as a security deposit:  $337.50 x 3.
This is a studio space for two artists, NOT a live/ work situation.
I graduated with a BFA in Drawing from Pratt Institute. I live, work,  and =
make=20
art in Bushwick. I am respectful, use the studio about three  times a week,=
 at varying
times of the day. I'm fine with working  alongside someone, or dividing up =
studio
times so we can be there  individually. If you are able to commit to splitt=
ing the
studio  space-wise and money-wise, send me some images of your work and tel=
l me=20
a  bit about yourself. You can see some of my drawings here:  http://www.fl=
ickr.com/photos/lilafreeman/sets/
 I work at an easel,  paint with oil paint, and draw with a number of non-t=
oxic=20
materials.
In the past year that I have been in this space, I have participated in  Bu=
shwick
Open Studios and Go! Open Studios and will participate in Open  Studios in =
the future
- ideally you would participate too.
Current studiomate is leaving at end of October but space is empty and avai=
lable
 now.

-There are only 6 apartments in the building on 5th ave. 3 bedroom  apartme=
nt (described
below. $1300+ & $900+ are the rents on the two  rooms available in the thre=
e bedroom).
Potentially both rooms could be  rented by someone or couple who wants an i=
n home
office / work / private  space.
-The apartment on 7th st is in a large pre-war clean and well maintained  b=
uilding
that with nice old charm but none of the icky feel some old  buildings can =
have.
 $1500+ for the large large room with 2 windows and a  great closet! Could =
be taken
by a couple or a single.
a bit about me:
36, female, massage therapist, doula and lactation counselor, actor  & stud=
ent who
loves music, movies, people, laughter, food, wine.
Non smoker
Just spent 7 weeks in Europe (Berlin, London, Switzerland & all over France=
) spending
time with family and studying french
I love to share meals / drinks / movies / late night shows and silly pop cu=
lture
 (that sortta thang) when it happens.
I love culture and travel.
I very much enjoy hosting visitors (I think sharing NYC/Bk with visitors  h=
elps=20
me to see the city through baby eyes and I get to see all sorts  of things =
I never
noticed before). Cherish good company &  conversation, Sunday brunch (can b=
e on=20
saturday too :-), flowers &  plants. I care very much to create a real home=
. A cozy
and comfortable  place that I want to spend time in and that others feel co=
mfortable
 being at home in.
I appreciate when everyone living in the space feels at home and  respects =
one another
by taking care of the space, keeping things in  reasonable order, being con=
siderate
of bathroom needs and common space.  Spaces in these here parts are "cozy" =
as brokers
like to say,  I call  them small :-) but somehow it always seems to work ou=
t when
a nice mix  of people share a space.

Some descriptions of the apartment on 7th st just E of 5th ave
The bedrooms are not equal in size. The one I would be renting is about 3  =
times
 the size of the smaller room. It's about 20'x12' with a great,  deep, talk=
 built
in old style closet (so it doesn't take up any space).  Two big windows wit=
h a descent
view since we are on the too floor of a  tall building (4th floor/top floor=
).
Easy close access to roof via real stairs and door.
Open kitchen / living space with two large windows. Shaped more like a  squ=
are so
it has a big feeling, very open and spacious. The fire escape  is off of th=
e living
space so it can be used by everyone as a nice place  to have a coffee, drin=
k or=20
meal...
Bathroom has a window and is spacious. Has old black and white tile floor w=
 a full
size bathtub and pedestal sink.
Updated kitchen with dishwasher and tile floor (creating a spatial delineat=
ion between
kitchen and living room.
Large closet off of wide entrance hall way. Lots of light, airy and spaciou=
s feeling.
Near by are trains, gym, cafes farmers market, restaurants ad bars. This  a=
pt is
 closer to the R,F,G at 9th st but still very close to all of the  same stu=
ff as
 the other apt.
Both are in great shape, close to park, amenities (incl transportation), & =
convieniently
located to the city.
Ok, bored of reading yet? Or super excited to connect? ;-)

ROOMS FOR SUBLET

$75 per day, East Village, 3 rooms, Couch/twin bed in sunlit living room  r=
ented
 by the night, WiFi, phone, 2 cats & breakfast included
Available: Now through indefinite
This is a lovely place to come to a few nights a week (when needed) in  the=
 midst
of one of the nicest most convenient neighborhoods in  Manhattan. Not a pla=
ce to
 move into; the aptartment is more like staying  at your favorite aunts but=
 with
 a more comfortable couch (because its a  bed and not a couch). Perfect for=
 someone
who lives out of town but  needs a place to stay a few nights a week in the=
 city
 without the  responsibility of keeping it stocked or clean. I do expect a =
level
 of  neatness, as in I do not want to be putting away someones stuff or  cl=
eaning
up after anyone. But I will take care of keeping the apt clean,  breakfast =
dishes(all
cat care of course) and will stock the apt with  coffee tea etc.
I would describe the place as cluttered but neat, clean, airey, light  (win=
dows=20
on all sides) and spacious. I would like a person who needs to  come to the=
 city
 somewhere between 6 - 12 or more nights a month,  weeknights preferred. I =
will=20
consider 2 people who want to "share" the  opportunity; meaning they would =
come=20
at different times.
I considered doing airbnb but I don't want a constant flow of different  pe=
ople=20
here and I would like to know the person or people who stay here.  I will n=
eed references
and will of course want to meet the person or  persons first.

I am a female mid twenties dancer and yoga teacher who also works full  tim=
e while
I'm building my career until my dance and yoga careers can  support me full=

a great roommate because I'm very rarely home  during the day, and when I a=
m, I'm
warm and outgoing, but I can also  keep to myself and clean up after myself=
.
The landlords live downstairs and are so responsive and helpful. It's  like=
 living

ecessary,
laid back, cleans up after yourself and respectful of the  roommate situati=
on. Open
to males or females, but generally prefer  female.
Feel free to ask me any questions!!

$1300 per month, Fort Greene/ Wallabout, 1000 sq. ft., Share a Sunny & Larg=
e Loft
with Only One Person... and a dog.
Available: Now through end of the year
The Loft: Two private bedrooms and two semi-private studios. The  available=
 bedroom
and studio are across from one another and create  about 450 sq. ft. of pri=

space. We share a large, open, dishwasher,  cabinet filled, kitchen, linen =
closet,
coat closet, and large bathroom  with bathtub. There are high ceilings, ama=
zing=20
5th floor views of  downtown Manhattan and Brooklyn, and beautiful light wi=
th killer
 sunsets.
About the share: The loft is for one artist/ creative person. It is not  se=
t-up=20
for entertaining. I prefer enjoying the city in the city and  maybe have a =
guest
 once a month, before going out. I like that my  roommate doesn't have to c=
ome home
to five people watching TV all night.  When I'm home, I'm quiet. If you're =
looking
for a loft share that has  real walls, is healthy and comfy to live in, env=
ironmentally
conscious,  where you can focus on your work, are okay with a small dog, an=
d are
  clean, this is your space!!
My dog: I have a 30lb. Dachshund Mix who's friendly and snuggly. But the  p=
lace=20
isn't doggie, except for the dog. My dog likes people. He likes  hanging ou=
t. Please
be ok with him saying hi in your space. Friendly and  trained dogs are welc=
omed.
The Building: Quiet with dogs, families and professionals. No students.  Ga=
y friendly.
There is a laundry room, parking garage ($180 mo. for  cars), roof-deck (mo=
re great
views), an organic grocer, spa, kick-boxing  studio and Cuban Restaurant on=
 the=20
ground floor. There's also front  desk security Monday - Friday (great for =
receiving
packages). Free and  ample parking under the BQE.
The location: The Wallabout Neighborhood is between Fort Greene and the  Na=
vy Yard.
It's like Dumbo ten years ago (yes, safe!). There's a  fantastic Italian Re=
staurant
around the corner. Pratt Graduate Studios,  lived-in lofts, and mix use bui=
ldings
nearby. A short walk up to Myrtle  and Dekalb Street for retail. The Brookl=
yn Flea,
Fort Greene Market and  Park are also nearby. The area has retained a small=
 town
 feel. It's also  incredibly beautiful with buildings that date back over a=
 hundred
 years, including carriage houses.
Commute: Walk or bus to the F train; the bus stops right outside the  build=
ing.=20
There are two more bus lines nearby. The G train is a short  walk, the Q 20=
 minutes.
Please google the address and scope out your  commute beforehand: 275 Park =
Avenue,
Brooklyn NY 11205.
The rent is $1300 and includes FIOS. We share electric (about $30 each).  T=
he building
pays for gas. First and security to move in: $2600.
Building Management will run a credit check before you can move in. Please =
have=20
good credit, and a job.

Clinton Housing Development Company (CHDC) is a community based  not-for-pr=
ofit=20
organization that renovates and manages affordable  housing in the Clinton =
and Chelsea
communities. Since 1973, CHDC has  renovated over 800 affordable apartments=
 in 80
buildings. All CHDC  developments, low-rise 4 to 6 story buildings, reinfor=
ce the
existing  neighborhood fabric. CHDC develops apartments for rental and home=
  ownership,
and supportive housing for social service needy persons. By  selecting deve=
lopments,
which solve both community problems and meet  current citywide housing need=
s, CHDC
meets its mission of creating  affordable housing and preserving community.
Buildings:
West 52nd Street is a 5-story walkup, fully renovated, which consists of  s=
tudios,
1 bedroom, 2 bedroom, and 3 bedroom apartments. It also  includes a garden =
courtyard,
laundry room and a resident superintendent.
Project Description and Requirements:
These buildings were formerly city owned and fully renovated. The  renovati=
on was
funded through a combination of public and private loans  and investments. =
The private
investment, through Federal Low Income  Housing Tax Credits, requires a cer=
tain=20
percentage of each development  be occupied by low income and very low-inco=
me eligible
tenants (see  income limits above), usually referred to as Tax Credit units=
. This
type  of funding requires annual tenant income certification for a 15-year =
 period.
Annual income certification is not required after the first  initial certif=
ication,
for apartments designated for middle-income  applicants. However, these are=
 not=20
Section 8 apartments and rents are  not based on 30% of income. These renta=
l apartments
are rent stabilized,  with 2-year leases with increases based on rent stabi=
lization
 guidelines. If household income increases there is no additional rent  cha=
rged,
 if household income decreases there is no additional rent  subsidy.
Apartments:
All the apartments are renovated with hardwood floors, tiled bathrooms,  ki=
tchens
with wooden cabinets and appliances. The 3 bedroom units have a  full and a=
 half
 bath. All apartments include cooking gas.
Accessibility:
All apartments are walkup units.
Selection Process:
If your application is both income and household size eligible, you will  b=
e notified
in writing to attend an open house. You will receive a list  of required in=
come=20
documentation at the open house. Interviews will be  scheduled after receip=
t of=20
documentation. Applicants not providing  income documentation will not be i=
nterviewed.
Credit checks at  applicant's expense are required. Following the interview=
 a  representative
of CHDC will conduct a home visit. Applicants will be  selected after the h=
ome visit.
All decisions are final and confidential,  and all applicants will be notif=
ied as
to their status, whether or not  they are selected.

Good human being seeks housing starting in November or December.
Andy is a late 20s human that doesn't take himself too seriously.  He  has =
a steady
job and when not working or sleeping he is usually found  either
a) on a bike
b) in front of a computer
c) at a concert
d) at a place where he can dance(everywhere)
e) at an art event
f) making art
He is originally from Detroit, and has lived in DC for the past four  years=
.  He
 is familiar with the joys and horrors of living with  strangers, and in a =
double
blind test of roommates all participants  found him to be a joy.  Except fo=
r test
subject D, but he hates  everything, including himself (that jerk).
He has been described as "The best kind of chill.  Chill enough that he  is=
 fun=20
to be around, but not so chill you wonder if he is dead" -Andy  Timmons
He is not Andy Timmons the guitarist http://andytimmons.com/
But one day he hopes to steal his domain name.
Andy is moving to NYC in mid Nov, but is willing to pay for a place  starti=
ng on
 Nov 1st, or any day in November before his move, since he  knows places ar=
e expensive.
 He is also able to move in at the beginning  of December.
Local Transportation: I ride my bike and walk most places

Or in that general vicinity., bigish..., Looking for a  Artists Loft
Available: 1 December through 7 January
I'm heading to NY to spend a month creating some work for Under The  Radar =
Festival
at The Public Theatre in January. I'm looking for a space  that I can live =
and work
in for about 5 weeks (for all of December and  the first week of Jan). Idea=
lly I
 would like to find a large artist's  loft in Brooklyn to sublet.
I'll mostly be working with drawing, animation, puppets and projection  so =
you wouldn't
need to fear big sloppy colorful messes being left all  over your floor. I'=
m very
considerate and trustworthy, and accustomed to  keeping peoples places fres=
h and
 loved while they're away. I'm hoping  to find somewhere that isn't too clu=
ttered
or pristine- somewhere that  has a bit of bohemian charm, and enough room t=
o play
with projection.
I can afford $3000 max for the 5 weeks.
Here's some links to my stuff if you're interested:
A performance I made and have spent the past 3 years touring around the  wo=

SWAP

BERLIN, Swap, Kreuzberg, 2200 sq ft - (200 sq meters), very large and  lumi=
nous=20
2 rooms artist studio + separate loft apartment. Swap for a  flat in NEW YO=
RK.
Available: January 2013 through June 2013
I'm looking for someone from New York who would be interested to swap  his/=
her flat
(even if small) for my large studio + flat in Berlin.
You could be several people or a small family too: there's much place in he=
re.
I'll be part of a residency program that includes a studio at Triangle,
in Dumbo, from next year January on, but I still need a place to stay.
Both studio and flat are in the same house in Kreuzberg, in the center of B=
erlin,
one of the coolest areas of the city.
The studio has 2 big rooms with a 28 feet long wall in the first one and  a=
 39 feet
long wall in the second one, shower and toilets,  internet/Wifi.
The flat is on the same floor, just across the hallway. It's also very calm=
 and=20
comfortable.
You can find these on the top floor of a building that used to be a  chromi=
ng plating
company giving it a loft character; the ground floor is  still active in th=
is branch.
The light is very nice... just great for working, and it stays very warm in=
 the=20
winter.
It's perfect for one person or 2 artists or an artist couple, each of  you =
could
 have a big separate room to work and a one-room loft to share.
Plenty of nice places around: restaurants, bars, organic supermarket ... et=
c.
I would like to swap it for a flat in Manhattan or in Brooklyn from  Januar=
y to=20
minimum end of June 2013 (eventually end of August).
If you are interested, just send me an email, or if you know of anyone  who=
 might
be interested, please, feel free to send it out!
Thanks a lot for your help,
Best,
Renaud

 Storefront, North Windows, Convertible into Separate Studio  Spaces, bathr=

ension possible<br /><br /> 1200 sqft (20' x 60'), with 1200 sqft basement,=
 Superintendent, 14'  ceilings, bathroom, kitchen ready for gas stove hooku=
p, basement  bathroom plumbing ready for hookup. North windows. Artists may=
 paint,  subdivide. <br /> <br /> Rent directly from owner, well maintained=
 property. Heat not included.  Sorry, no live-ins. But small (550 sq ft) st=
udio apartment above  storefront with 1200 sq ft roofdeck garden becomes av=
ailable in  December. <br /> <br /> The space has been rented as a restaura=
nt before, but would be suitable  as studio space or cafe/gallery.   The on=
ly fees are the rent,  utilities, and credit check.<br /> <br /> John is th=
e owner, I am his assistant. There is no broker, and no broker fees.  I am =
a visual artist.  He is a businessman.  <br /> <br /> "The roof of the ware=
house is 1200 sq ft.  I've been pushing for an  urban garden space, and the=
 owner has finally agreed to building the  foundation (the decking, fencing=
, possibly the beds).  Since he  originally wanted to simply "build up" and=
 add another warehouse floor -  which would have created a cement wall for =
all surrounding apartments  to look out onto - I consider it a great victor=
y for the greening of  Bushwick, which had the lowest ratio of green space =
to square footage of  all the neighborhoods in Brooklyn.  There's a small s=
tudio apartment  that overlooks and has access to the garden space.....etc.=
 continued as  you wrote<br /> <br /> There's a small studio apartment that=
 overlooks and has access to the  garden space.  I built my rooftop garden =
in part so that when I edit, I  am overlooking greenery, as opposed to the =
cement wall and rooftop that  was there when I moved in.  It calms and insp=
ires me, and vastly  improves my quality of life in the city.  From the per=
spective of a  painter who works long hours in studio then doesn't want to =
make the  commute home, or cafe / gallery owner in same position, another o=
ption  for green use would be the storefront/cafe tenant renting the garden=
  space as "locally grown" or 'pick your own' veggies for the restaurant  m=
eal, or an artist's dwelling that's a 10 step commute from their  studio.<b=
r /> <br /> Basically, the spaces (warehouse, storefront, apartment) have t=
he  potential to work together as a very artist-supportive/green  environme=
nt. More and more artists are moving East to avoid rising  rents, so it see=
ms to me the perfect use for the property.  <br /> <br /> contact John (own=
er) or Caroline<br /><br /> <a style=3D"color: black; " shape=3D"rect" href=

or for exhibiting work.  Additionally, a large open gallery space is being =
completed on the floor  below us, with two new bathrooms for artists' use (=
we currently use an  upstairs restroom). This space will be used for art  e=
xhibitions/installations by building artists.<br /> <br /> All utilities in=
cluding heat and A/C are included in the monthly rent of  $675, divided bet=
ween us ($337.50 each).  To share the space, you will  need first month's r=

 you are able to commit to splitting the studio  space-wise and money-wise,=
 send me some images of your work and tell me a  bit about yourself. You ca=

studying french <br /> I love to share meals / drinks / movies / late night=
 shows and silly pop culture (that sortta thang) when it happens.<br /> I l=
ove culture and travel.<br /> <br /> I very much enjoy hosting visitors (I =
think sharing NYC/Bk with visitors  helps me to see the city through baby e=
yes and I get to see all sorts  of things I never noticed before). Cherish =
good company &  conversation, Sunday brunch (can be on saturday too :-), fl=
owers &  plants. I care very much to create a real home. A cozy and comfort=
able  place that I want to spend time in and that others feel comfortable  =
being at home in. <br /> <br /> I appreciate when everyone living in the sp=
ace feels at home and  respects one another by taking care of the space, ke=
eping things in  reasonable order, being considerate of bathroom needs and =
common space.  Spaces in these here parts are "cozy" as brokers like to say=

 We like to keep a quiet, tidy, and  respectful atmosphere about the apartm=
ent, so if you are loud, dirty,  and nasty please don't respond to this pos=
t. We all keep very busy with  our work responsibilities and various activi=
ties (going to art  galleries/museums, traveling, going to concerts, cookin=
g, training,  etc.) but are happy to make dinner together or share a drink =
at home  when we get a chance to see each other. We're definitely not crazy=
 party  people but we do occasionally enjoy crazy parties, just not in our =
 apartment. <br /> <br /> No couples or pets (allergic to both drama and ca=
ts and dogs) and the  apartment is smoke-free. Ideally you have a full-time=
 job or are a  full-time student with a part-time job. No work from home pr=
ofessional  blogger hermit types. We'd prefer a roommate looking for a long=
er term  stay (at least 3 months). If you think you'd be a good fit for the=
  apartment please email to set up a time to meet.<br /><br /> <a style=3D"=

of town but  needs a place to stay a few nights a week in the city without =
the  responsibility of keeping it stocked or clean. I do expect a level of =
 neatness, as in I do not want to be putting away someones stuff or  cleani=
ng up after anyone. But I will take care of keeping the apt clean,  breakfa=
st dishes(all cat care of course) and will stock the apt with  coffee tea e=
tc. <br /> <br /> I would describe the place as cluttered but neat, clean, =
airey, light  (windows on all sides) and spacious. I would like a person wh=
o needs to  come to the city somewhere between 6 - 12 or more nights a mont=
h,  weeknights preferred. I will consider 2 people who want to "share" the =
 opportunity; meaning they would come at different times. <br /> <br /> I c=

00 per month, Fort Greene/ Wallabout, 1000 sq. ft., Share a Sunny & Large L=
oft with Only One Person... and a dog.<br /> Available: Now through end of =
the year<br /><br /> The Loft: Two private bedrooms and two semi-private st=
udios. The  available bedroom and studio are across from one another and cr=
eate  about 450 sq. ft. of private space. We share a large, open, dishwashe=
r,  cabinet filled, kitchen, linen closet, coat closet, and large bathroom =
 with bathtub. There are high ceilings, amazing 5th floor views of  downtow=
n Manhattan and Brooklyn, and beautiful light with killer  sunsets.<br /> <=
br /> About the share: The loft is for one artist/ creative person. It is n=
ot  set-up for entertaining. I prefer enjoying the city in the city and  ma=
ybe have a guest once a month, before going out. I like that my  roommate d=
oesn't have to come home to five people watching TV all night.  When I'm ho=
me, I'm quiet. If you're looking for a loft share that has  real walls, is =
healthy and comfy to live in, environmentally conscious,  where you can foc=
us on your work, are okay with a small dog, and are  clean, this is your sp=
ace!!<br /> <br /> My dog: I have a 30lb. Dachshund Mix who's friendly and =
snuggly. But the  place isn't doggie, except for the dog. My dog likes peop=
le. He likes  hanging out. Please be ok with him saying hi in your space. F=
riendly and  trained dogs are welcomed. <br /> <br /> The Building: Quiet w=
ith dogs, families and professionals. No students.  Gay friendly. There is =
a laundry room, parking garage ($180 mo. for  cars), roof-deck (more great =
views), an organic grocer, spa, kick-boxing  studio and Cuban Restaurant on=
 the ground floor. There's also front  desk security Monday - Friday (great=
 for receiving packages). Free and  ample parking under the BQE.<br /> <br =
/> The location: The Wallabout Neighborhood is between Fort Greene and the =
 Navy Yard. It's like Dumbo ten years ago (yes, safe!). There's a  fantasti=
c Italian Restaurant around the corner. Pratt Graduate Studios,  lived-in l=
ofts, and mix use buildings nearby. A short walk up to Myrtle  and Dekalb S=
treet for retail. The Brooklyn Flea, Fort Greene Market and  Park are also =
nearby. The area has retained a small town feel. It's also  incredibly beau=
tiful with buildings that date back over a hundred  years, including carria=
ge houses. <br /> <br /> Commute: Walk or bus to the F train; the bus stops=
 right outside the  building. There are two more bus lines nearby. The G tr=
ain is a short  walk, the Q 20 minutes. Please google the address and scope=
 out your  commute beforehand: 275 Park Avenue, Brooklyn NY 11205. <br /> <=
br /> The rent is $1300 and includes FIOS. We share electric (about $30 eac=
h).  The building pays for gas. First and security to move in: $2600. <br /=
> <br /> Building Management will run a credit check before you can move in=
. Please have good credit, and a job.<br /><br /> <a style=3D"color: black;=

zation that renovates and manages affordable  housing in the Clinton and Ch=
elsea communities. Since 1973, CHDC has  renovated over 800 affordable apar=
tments in 80 buildings. All CHDC  developments, low-rise 4 to 6 story build=
ings, reinforce the existing  neighborhood fabric. CHDC develops apartments=
 for rental and home  ownership, and supportive housing for social service =
needy persons. By  selecting developments, which solve both community probl=
ems and meet  current citywide housing needs, CHDC meets its mission of cre=
ating  affordable housing and preserving community.<br /> <br /> Buildings:=
<br /> West 52nd Street is a 5-story walkup, fully renovated, which consist=
s of  studios, 1 bedroom, 2 bedroom, and 3 bedroom apartments. It also  inc=
ludes a garden courtyard, laundry room and a resident superintendent.<br />=
 <br /> Project Description and Requirements:<br /> These buildings were fo=
rmerly city owned and fully renovated. The  renovation was funded through a=
 combination of public and private loans  and investments. The private inve=
stment, through Federal Low Income  Housing Tax Credits, requires a certain=
 percentage of each development  be occupied by low income and very low-inc=
ome eligible tenants (see  income limits above), usually referred to as Tax=
 Credit units. This type  of funding requires annual tenant income certific=
ation for a 15-year  period. Annual income certification is not required af=
ter the first  initial certification, for apartments designated for middle-=
income  applicants. However, these are not Section 8 apartments and rents a=
re  not based on 30% of income. These rental apartments are rent stabilized=
,  with 2-year leases with increases based on rent stabilization  guideline=
s. If household income increases there is no additional rent  charged, if h=
ousehold income decreases there is no additional rent  subsidy.<br /> <br /=
> Apartments:<br /> All the apartments are renovated with hardwood floors, =
tiled bathrooms,  kitchens with wooden cabinets and appliances. The 3 bedro=
om units have a  full and a half bath. All apartments include cooking gas.<=
br /> <br /> Accessibility:<br /> All apartments are walkup units.<br /> <b=
r /> Selection Process:<br /> If your application is both income and househ=
old size eligible, you will  be notified in writing to attend an open house=
. You will receive a list  of required income documentation at the open hou=
se. Interviews will be  scheduled after receipt of documentation. Applicant=
s not providing  income documentation will not be interviewed. Credit check=
s at  applicant's expense are required. Following the interview a  represen=
tative of CHDC will conduct a home visit. Applicants will be  selected afte=
r the home visit. All decisions are final and confidential,  and all applic=
ants will be notified as to their status, whether or not  they are selected=

ix large  windows -- its a bright and happy place. It's on the second floor=
 of a  pre-war building. The bed is a queen-size and it's brand new and  co=
mfortable.<br /> <br /> Rents are negotiable according to the length of sta=
y....<br /> <br /> Located in the heart of Little Italy (a really fun, trad=
itional and safe  neighborhood), the apartment is perfectly placed in the c=
enter of the  city, only a few blocks from Chinatown, Nolita, SoHo, TriBeCa=
, and the  Lower East Side, and the East Village is a 15-minute walk away. =
My  neighborhood is filled with excellent restaurants, bars, shops and  bou=
tiques, and there are several subways (6/N/Q/B/D/J/M/Z) and a parking  lot =
all close.<br /> <br /> I always leave behind information, advice and instr=
uctions on the  apartment and the neighborhood, including recommendations o=
n  restaurants, bars, laundry, pharmacies grocery stores and other stuff to=
  make your life more convenient. If you have any specific questions,  plea=
se feel free to ask.<br /> <br /> I'm looking for someone mature, quiet, re=
sponsible and discreet. This is  NOT a social or party situation and theref=
ore not the best for a young  student. No parties or frequeny guests... jus=
t nice, serious people  please. <br /> <br /> The apartment works for coupl=
es, but is best for a single. It's on the small side, as is typical of NYC =
apartments.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Please no smoking in the apartment...<br /> =
