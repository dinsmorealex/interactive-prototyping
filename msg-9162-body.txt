space during weekday evenings and weekend afternoons and evenings.=20
Sherri Jackson
Sherri is the founder of Park Soap, and has been a soapmaker for over 15 =
years. She uses the highest quality, organic and sustainable oils and bot=
anicals available in her line and loves to &quot;keep it simple.&quot; Sh=
erri makes fine quality soap in her corner of the space, and it makes for=
 a positively pleasant and unique atmosphere.=20

Space Specifications:
The corner available is exactly 1/4 of a 550-sq-foot room. (Note: chair a=
nd tabletop in photos are not part of the space, though the tabletop can =
stay if wanted).
13&#39; ceilings made of cozy whitewashed planks
Light grey concrete floors (though we&#39;re planning to give the floors =
a fresh coat of paint soon; perhaps something lighter).
This space is thoroughly blasted with natural light coming from two direc=
tions. Visitors often remark about the abundant light and the expansive v=
iew.=20

About the Cost &amp; Commitment:
All spacemates inhabit exactly 25% of the room and pay exactly 25% of the=
 total cost of rent.
Newcomers are not gouged. One tenant (Bryan) compiles all of the spacemat=
es&#39; rent payments into one payment to the landlord, and does not in a=
ny way compensate himself for the task.
We keep it fair and simple and friendly. The person accepted into the spa=
ce must pay first and last month&#39;s rent + security deposit equal to o=
ne month&#39;s rent up front. This is a total of $1137. Subsequent monthl=
y payments are $379/mo.
Oure lease is up for renewal in April, at which point there may be a smal=
l increase in rent.  (We honestly don&#39;t know, but we do not expect a =
giant hike in rent for the forthcoming lease).
For those moving out ask for a minimum of 45 days advance notice for thos=
e planning to move out.

Available: Mar 01, 2015 through Mar 01, 2016

ease in my studio, approximately 200 square feet for $550, utilities incl=
uded (heat &amp; electricity). The ceilings are 11 feet high, so it feels=
 larger. The entire 600 sq foot studio is shared with two other people - =
my space is in the back and completely private with a door, while your sp=
ace is in the middle, divided from the other studio with a partial wall, =
which goes all the way up to the ceiling. There are no windows, but abund=

The charming space has one exposed brick wall, and original details of wo=
od ceiling, beams and floor. It feels very comfortable and homey in there=

uff, but it&#39;s best to take a look at it in person and see how you wou=
ld set it up yourself.

hour access to building. Many artists and creative professionals in the b=
uilding.

Amazing, prime location, just 2 blocks from the G at Greenpoint Ave and w=
alking distance to tons of great bars, shops, and restaurants.

I prefer someone with a quiet practice - no woodworking (occasional is ok=
), loud machines, or toxic materials. I require first month&#39;s rent pl=
us 2 months security deposit. The lease is for one year, but if you need =
to leave before then, you can give me 45 days notice.=20

$600.00 Per Month, East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 400 sq. ft., Studio Share=
 in Great Location - Quiet Artist Filled Building
Available: Feb 10, 2015 through Aug 31, 2015

Hi,

I am a 26 year old photographer from Michigan and have been working in Ne=
w York for three years. I recently rented out a nice studio space in East=
 Williamsburg where I go to shoot some things after work and on the weeke=
nds. It is a decent sized room with wooden floors, four windows that brin=
g in a lot of natural light, electric heating, free high-speed wifi, and =
it is in a great neighborhood. I&#39;m finding that there is a lot of tim=
e that the space is open, and I don&#39;t use a great lot of it while I&#=
39;m there. I&#39;m a photographer, but the space is available for anyone=
  for their work.

I use one said of the room, and the other side is available for use, whic=
h has two windows and a full white wall. I have an extra desk if you&#39;=
d like to use it.

I&#39;m looking for someone considerate and trustworthy. I&#39;m respectf=
ul of space, and usually focused on my work. Utilities go from $30-$90 wh=
ich we split. There is a slop sink, bathrooms and roof access around the =
corner.

If you have any questions or would like to see more pictures please get i=
n touch and tell me a little bit about what you&#39;re looking for. Look =
forward to hearing from you!

Thanks,

Jackson

ons; you can see a sample by Googling our address. We have a vibrant comm=
unity full of creatives ranging from furniture designers and fabricators,=
 to artists who exhibit in Chelsea and internationally. The neighborhood =
is exploding with new stores, bars, restaurants, and more.

Us:=20
It is a quiet studio; everyone has different schedules and it is rare tha=
t two or more people are in the entire space at once. We are a friendly a=
nd relaxed group who have known each other for years, looking for a serio=
us and considerate artist to join us. We are a mix of sculptors and paint=
ers, working in mixed media, but nothing that is noxious or which invades=
 others&#39; spaces. We help each other if and when needed, yet also high=
ly respect each other&#39;s privacy to focus on his/her work.

What is absolutely not tolerated:=20
--Maltreatment of the space (damage, not participating in helping maintai=
n the common area, sink or trash)=20
--Any activity that disrupts others&#39; ability to work in the space (ex=
cessive noise, dust, fumes, etc.)=20
--Late rent=20
--Smoking in the studio=20
--Parties or social gatherings in the space (unless organized together or=
 run by everyone)
Serious inquiries only from persons who are reliable and responsible. Tha=
nks!

Available: Feb 15, 2015 through Sept 15, 2015

I&#39;m writing a memoir and subletting my 400 sq-ft artist&#39;s studio =
in South Park Slope, beginning February 15th, for at least 7 months--unti=
l mid-September, 2015, or longer--we can talk. The $700 rent includes uti=
lities and internet.

It&#39;s really nice. On the ground floor of a small artists&#39; buildin=
g, it has two windows and a door that opens out onto a back courtyard, wh=
ich creates a good deal of light and air. The studio has 12&#39; ceilings=
, a slop sink, and good fluorescent lighting, with plenty of power and ou=
tlets for incandescent lights and equipment.

The overall 800 sq-ft space is shared with a couple of visual artists wor=
king in the other half of the space, separated by partial walls and two e=
normous curtains. Because it&#39;s on the ground floor in an old, well-in=
sulated building, it doesn&#39;t get too hot in the summer, and there is =
good baseboard heating (new boiler!) the rest of the year. There is a goo=
d drafting table/desk with a chair, a futon couch, two large empty shelf =
units, and an empty filing cabinet.

The studio is on a cross-street between 4th and 5th Aves, a couple of blo=
cks from the Green Wood Cemetery, around the corner from the best pizza p=
lace in Brooklyn, Luigi&#39;s, and on the same block as the great Girasol=
 Mexican Bakery.

The landlord, an artist himself, is happy to help with any issues that co=
me up.

t in Great Pre-War Apartment Seconds from Prospect Park
Available: Mar 01, 2015 through Aug 31, 2016

I am looking for a friendly, responsible, and cleanly flatmate to rent a =
lovely room in my spacious 2-bedroom apartment in Windsor Terrace, Brookl=
yn. The apartment is in a very well maintained pre-war building just a fe=
w steps from Prospect Park. Easy and safe subway and bus connections (1 b=
lock to F and G trains at Ft. Hamilton Parkway, 12 minute walk to Q train=
).=20

The Room: The room is 11&#39; x 10&#39; and has a small closet with two s=
helves and hanging space. The room has two bright windows with wood venet=
ian blinds and hardwood floors. The available bedroom will be unfurnished=
 except for a solid wood armoire with hanging space on top and shelves on=
 bottom (pic to come). In addition, there is a small linen closet with sh=
elves in the hallway which is reserved entirely for this room to suppleme=
nt storage space. You are also welcome to keep coats in the front hall cl=
oset and there is room to store a box and/or a suitcase as well.

The remainder of the apartment is fully furnished.=20

I&#39;d like to find a flatmate who is thoughtful, easy-going, and a good=
 communicator. You should also be steadily employed and preferably work a=
way from home by and large. I have lived here for 9.5 years and I am pret=
ty settled in, but I&#39;m happy to share my home. I&#39;d like a roommat=
e who will contribute to the household by purchasing household staples to=
gether and helping with periodic cleaning of common spaces. I will ask yo=
u about your day and be happy to share a meal when our schedules coincide=
.=20

* Rent is $1040 month plus security deposit (1.5x monthly rent).
* Heat and hot water included.
* We would split the cost of gas/electric and Cable TV/Wi-Fi Internet equ=
ally. This runs approximately $125/each a month.

Available March 1. This rental period is until the end of Aug 2015 with p=
otential to renew.

About Me:

I&#39;m 35 yrs old (female) and I work as Director of community organizin=
g and social justice programs for a non-profit in Manhattan. I am social =
and thoughtful. I am a bit artistic though I tend to lean towards &quot;f=
unctional&quot; art and crafts, carpentry, etc. I like to go hiking and a=
lso enjoy cooking but tend to forage in the fridge when it is just me com=
ing home late from work which happens often. On a typical weeknight, if I=
 am getting home anytime after 8pm, I tend to crash on the couch with a g=
ood book or watch TV, if I haven&#39;t made plans to hang out with friend=
s. On a particularly energetic day, I might wake up and go for a walk/run=
 in the park before work and on others I hit the snooze on my alarm clock=
 several times before I can drag myself to a shower. Aside from an occasi=
onal back log of laundry in my own room, and once in a while a rinsed dis=
h or two in the sink, I like to keep the apartment very clean and orderly=
 for a bit of calm. I expect my flatmate to contribute to maintaining thi=
s peaceful and airy vibe.

My Home&#39;s Features:

Well maintained pre-war elevator apartment building with great charm. Red=
 brick building, terrazzo floors in halls and lobby.
Well equipped eat-in-kitchen, with plenty of cabinet space, though best s=
uited for a tall person, which I am not...
Large living room with ample seating and space to relax after a long day.=
=20
Original hardwood floors throughout and many windows.
Clean space and clutter free.
Pay per load washers/dryers available in basement.
Sorry, NO pets allowed.
No cigarette smokers.
Please do not email me if you are a couple seeking housing together... I =
am looking for one roommate only.

If you are interested please send me a note with information about yourse=
lf like I have included here. Please allow me a day or so to respond.=20

as been in apt. a year and hasn&#39;t been bothered by smoke odor.

My cat is nine, trained, gentle and friendly. Nails clipped and hair groo=
med weekly, so apt. has minimal hair.

ests OK as long as overnights aren&#39;t regular, such as every weekend o=
r for several weeknights). We asked our current roommate to move and he&#=
39;s doing so amicably because he has a girlfriend who stays overnight ev=
ery weekend and wants to sometimes during week. A male or female of any t=
ype or persuasion is OK. We don&#39;t discriminate.

 top floor and a bed/bath on the lower level. The lower level also has a =

grill.

About the roommates:
They&#39;re awesome! Both are female and in mid-twenties. One runs the Sn=
apchat account for a media company and the other just moved here from the=
 UK. Both very easy to get along with and friendly people. We&#39;re look=

time, but not a crazy partier. We like to cook dinner together and hang o=
ut occasionally, but we all have relatively busy schedules.=20

$1,300.00 Per Month, Bushwick, Brooklyn, Entire Floor of Renovated Duplex=
 Apt - Private 1/2 bath + 2 rooms
Available: Mar 01, 2015

The entire unfurnished bottom floor of my duplex apartment in Bushwick ha=
s just become available to rent starting March 1st.  It is a very large s=
pace with two rooms and a private  bath (the shower is upstairs in the fu=
ll bath). Its the ideal situation for someone who wants an office space o=
r separate living room to call his or her own.  There is also a private e=
ntrance downstairs making it pretty much your own apartment.  My current =
roommate who is unfortunately leaving Nyc arranged the space so he had a =
bedroom, living area, and office all within his own floor of the apartmen=
t.  The whole building is brand new and was gut renovated 2 years ago.  T=
he detailing of the apt is exquisite with hard wood floors, chandeliers, =
and an electric fireplace in the living area.

In terms of local transportation, the place is located just two blocks fr=
om the Knickerbocker Ave. M train stop.  Its also a quick and easy walk t=
o the Myrtle-Wyckoff L train &amp; the Gates Ave J/Z trains.  Its also an=
 easy walk to the bars and restaurants near the Dekalb/Jefferson/Morgan L=
 train stops.

A few of the amenities include:
High Ceilings
Central Air!
Large Kitchen with stove/oven, microwave, and portable dishwasher
Wi-Fi Internet Access
Backyard perfect for parties, bbqs, sunbathing
Laundry in the building (actually right outside your door in the downstai=
rs hallway)!

You would have two male roommates (one gay, one straight).  One is a musi=
cian and works for Central Park Summer Stage and the other is a professio=
nal dancer in his late twenties.

A mature individual who has an appreciation for cleanliness is required. =
 I&#39;m somewhat of a clean freak and its important to me that the commo=
n areas are kept pristine.  If this sounds like something that appeals to=
 you, then that&#39;s a good sign!  Additionally, a long-term roommate wo=
uld be ideal.  Couples need not reply to this ad; I&#39;m looking for onl=
y 1 roommate.

Well-trained Dogs are welcome.  The backyard is fenced in and its an idea=
l situation for someone who wants the opportunity to just let the dog out=
 in the back instead of walking him/her all of the time.  The backyard is=
 easily accessible right outside your door.

The dog in the pictures is moving out.

No smoking in the apartment.

Utilities are not included in the monthly $1300 rent.  They (electric, ga=
s, and internet) typically range anywhere from $80  $170 per person.  The=
 apt is already hooked up for cable t.v. if that&#39;s something you woul=
d like to invest in.

$800.00 Per Month, Midwood, Brooklyn, New York, Huge Sunny Room (2windows=
)
Available: Feb 15, 2015

Hello,=20

I need a roomate for the second bedroom of this beautiful apartment.
Your room is really big, private and cozy. And the price is really good b=
ecause of the old rent agreement.

I&#39;m a 28 year old female from the Basque Country- Spain. I do graphic=
 design, collages and videoart, and work from home. It could be cool, if =
we get along, to work here all together, but if you are out all day that =
is convenient too. No parties at home, just exceptionally- on your bday, =
maybe. Or if we really have to get drunk and there&#39;s no way to get ou=
t of the house. We can figure that out but if that is your thing, this is=
 absolutely not going to work.=20

I am on the tidy side and especially tidy with the common areas. No messe=
s here. Dishes cleaned right after you eat. Don&#39;t apply if you plan t=
o do the opposite.
I&#39;d want to be friends with you, if possible. But a ghost roommate ca=
n work really really well too.

The room is 750+utilities. Utilities are $50 per month. Wifi included. Bt=
w- there si central heating system. That means the house and your room ar=
e perfectly warm when you arrive home from this awful weather- this luxur=
y isn&#39;t common in this city for this price, I believe.=20
Possibility of private bathroom in the near future.

One month deposit and first month before moving.
Flexible with moving dates.

The Q train is 6min away, runs express to the city so it takes 20min to g=
et to Canal St (Chinatown) from the station. 30 min to Union Square.=20

If your dog is wonderful you might be able to bring it. I prefer non smok=
ers, although occasional 420 is fine. Open minded, mature, respectful peo=
ple are welcome. No brats, por favor.=20

I think that&#39;s all, you can ask your questions now, and tell me about=
 yourself so I can answer asap.
Some link to your social media could be also good to get a grasp of who y=
ou are.=20

$1,650.00 Per Month, Crown Heights, Brooklyn, 347 sq. ft., Master Bedroom=
 In Gorgeous and Homey Three-Story Brownstone
Available: Mar 01, 2015 through Oct 01, 2015

Hi,=20

It is with true regret that I must give this room up. I&#39;m moving to S=
an Francisco or else I would have held onto it as long as I could. I&#39;=
ll begin with the actual room. It&#39;s enormous, measuring at 19ft x 17f=
t. There is also a closet area that is 8ft x 3ft, bringing the total to 3=
47sqft. It feels like a studio apartment and easily holds a bed, a desk (=
I work from home), and a couch / living room area, with plenty of empty s=
pace left over. There are three large windows that let in tons of sunligh=
t throughout the day and three closets. One wall is completely lined with=
 shelves for an extraordinary amount of storage and decorating space. Add=
itionally, I will be looking to sell my bed and all of my furniture; you =
will have first dibs should that be of interest.=20

Now for the house. It&#39;s a historic brownstone with parquet hardwood f=
loors, intricate molding and a decorative fireplace. Architecturally, the=
y don&#39;t make apartments like this in NYC anymore. There are three sto=
ries connected by a beautiful wooden staircase. A huge plus is that all o=
f the common areas are located on the first floor so noise is never an is=
sue. These include a parlor / sunroom, a sizable living room / movie room=
, a gigantic dining room (with an indoor bike rack) and a kitchen. But my=
 favorite part is the backyard. During the warmer months, nothing beats g=
ardening in our three raised vegetable beds, grilling &amp; eating on the=
 outside table, and playing cornhole on our homemade set. But that&#39;s =
just me. Oh and there&#39;s also a laundry room with a washer and dryer, =
too!

Roommates. There are a total of five bedrooms rooms (including the master=
) and one guest room, two on the second story and three on the third stor=
y. The master bedroom is on the second story. Each story has a bathroom (=
two total), so you will be sharing a bathroom with just one other person.=
 Her name is Ope and she&#39;s really great. Very chill with an infectiou=
s laugh. I&#39;m the only one who&#39;s home on a regular basis due to my=
 work and most of the time the house is empty. Even on weeknights and wee=
kends, there&#39;s rarely ever more than two roommates at a time in commo=
n areas. Everyone is a mid-to-late 20-something working professional (ele=
mentary teacher, clothing designer, comedy writer, &amp; landscaper) who =
tends to be out and about. When home, everyone is extremely respectful of=
 everyone else&#39;s space and time. It usually stays pretty low-key thou=
gh dinners are hosted, movies are watched and fun is had.

The building supervisor is also really great. He makes our life a lot eas=
ier. Anytime an issue arises, he&#39;s on it within 24 hours. He lives do=
wnstairs but we never see him unless we call.=20

The apartment is located in Crown Heights, about a block and a half from =
Franklin (at St. Marks Ave and Rogers). We are close to grocery stores, r=
estaurants, bars, coffee shops, bike shops, yoga gyms and tons of other r=
esources. Brooklyn Public Library, Grand Army Plaza Farmer&#39;s Market, =
and Prospect Park are a pleasant 1.2 mile walk from the house. There&#39;=
s also quick access to the following trains: A, C, 2, 3, 4, 5, Shuttle, a=
nd lirr.=20

Our lease began on October 1st. You will replace my girlfriend and I on i=
t. Everyone in the house will then sign a new contract, still expiring on=
 October 1st of this year. There is no broker&#39;s fee, but you will be =
expected to provide last month&#39;s rent and a security deposit.=20

Who you are: an individual or couple preferably in your 20s or early 30s.=
 Everyone in the house is respectful, kind, and no-drama. We&#39;re looki=
ng for someone with a similar demeanor. Though not everyone knew each oth=
er before living together, everyone gets along. It&#39;s not unusual to j=
oin in on another roommate&#39;s BBQ, board game or watching NBA. It&#39;=
s a very warm and comfortable home and that&#39;s highly valued by everyo=
ne. So the right fit will not only be financially credible (you will be a=
sked to submit the typical documentation proving your credibility as well=
 as a credit report) but also have generally good vibes.=20

March 1st is the move-in date. I will only respond to serious inquiries. =
No pets unfortunately. Thanks a ton, looking forward to meeting you!=20

Best,
Nick

$900.00 Per Month, Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, 110 sq. ft., Sweet room in a b=
ig 3-bedroom apartment (on Biggie's block!)
Available: Feb 11, 2015

Whaaat? Only $900 for a room in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn? An affordable roo=
m in an excellent neighborhood, could this be true? Yes, for real!=20

Coffee shops, restaurants, bars, two gourmet food stores, a general groce=
ry store, a pharmacy and a bunch of bodegas are all within a one-block ra=
dius. Walk a few blocks more and you&#39;ll be at Pratt, Ft. Greene park =
and its Saturday farmers&#39; market, Brooklyn Flea (during the summer) a=
long with everything else Clinton Hill, Ft. Greene, and Prospect Heights =
has to offer.

Transportation to Manhattan is a breeze (the C train is right around the =
corner) and the G train (2 blocks away) makes travel to other parts of Br=
ooklyn very accessible. Q, B, N, R, 2, 3, 4, 5, L I R R @ Atlantic Termin=
al is about a 15-minute walk away.

I have a large bedroom (can be furnished with a twin bed, desk, drawers) =
with two closets available in my 3-bedroom apartment, which is on a quiet=
, tree-lined block. It&#39;s on the 2nd floor of a prewar building, so th=
ere&#39;s a dining room and large, sunlit living room, also. The kitchen =
and bathroom were renovated a few years ago, so the apartment has all the=
 old world charm without the grossness of old buildings.

The ideal person for the room doesn&#39;t own a ton of stuff, is easy-goi=
ng, respectful, tidy, and comfortable around a sweet kid . The third &quo=
t;roommate&quot; is my 6-year-old daughter, who spends half the time with=
 her dad. I work M-F during the days (although occasionally from home). W=
e&#39;re not around a whole lot, but when we are we appreciate our home f=
ull of its good vibes and warmth.

First month plus a security deposit to move in. You will need to provide =
three references. No shares nor couples; sorry! Utilities (wifi, electric=
ity and gas) are around $50/month. There is a cleaning person (price incl=
uded in rent) who comes every other week. The move-in date is flexible, a=
s is the move-out date. Just looking for a steady, easy-going nice person=
.

$1,100.00 Per Month, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, 8.5' x 11' sq. ft., Seeking Ro=
ommate for Sunny, Brand New Home
Available: Mar 01, 2015 through Mar 01, 2016

About the Space: We just found this amazing three bedroom apartment right=
 off the Nassau G in Greenpoint and are seeking a third roommate.  The ap=
artment is located on the third floor, every room has a window, it was ju=
st newly renovated, and we would be the first people to live there.  The =
communal kitchen space is small but the rooms are all relatively equal in=
 size and have more than enough room for a full/queen size bed, desk, and=
 dresser.  Your room doesn&#39;t have a closet, but if you need a little =
more storage space you can use the communal closet in the hallway.

Although there&#39;s nothing extra-fancy about the apartment amenities, i=
t is located in prime Greenpoint within walking distance to two parks, th=
e waterfront, tons of great restaurants and bars, and laundry is around t=
he corner.

About Us:  We&#39;re two females in our mid-20&#39;s, both with full-time=
 creative careers.  Although we do love to hang out, eat, and grab a drin=
k, we&#39;re both relatively quiet and like to keep our home a mellow and=
 drama free sanctuary from busy city life.  =20

About You:  Mid-20&#39;s to 30&#39;s, laid back, will always pay the bill=
s and rent on time, friendly and can share a laugh but respects alone tim=
e and doesn&#39;t bring the party home.  Major plus if you&#39;re also a =
nature lover, cyclist, or self-proclaimed introvert.  No couples, please.=

$1,300.00 Per Month, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, Bedroom + Workspace Available=
 Together
Available: Feb 15, 2015

Hi! I&#39;m looking for someone to take over half of a spacious apartment=
 in a great location for $1300. Available short term as well.

The apartment takes up the 3rd floor of a walk-up and is split into a pri=
vate bedroom, a living room/large office, and a closet for each tenant. F=
ull bathroom with tub, separate sink room for convenience, and standard k=
itchen with new appliances, including a dishwasher. This will all be shar=
ed and will be on your side of the apartment. The rooms pictured are the =
ones for rent, but will be unfurnished.=20

Utilities run $60-100/month depending on the time of year; includes inter=
net, gas, electric. Landlord owns the restaurant downstairs so is readily=
 available. Dogs allowed on case-by-case basis.

Location:
10-15 min walk to B/Q/R at Dekalb or the C at Lafayette; 10 min walk to G=
 at Clinton-Washinton; B54 right out front, 2-3 blocks to B69 and B62.
Close to Manhattan Bridge by bike. My commute to the East Village takes 1=
5-20 min.
Across the street from Walgreen&#39;s and 24/7 food market, close to a st=
retch of restaurants and shops on Dekalb, 2-3 blocks away from laundromat=
, bike shop, Fort Greene Park, hardware store; very close to Pratt by bus=
 or bike, or a nice walk. All in all, very convenient location.

About Me: Late 20&#39;s female; I work in design. I enjoy spending time o=
utside of the apartment, riding bikes, eating out, and prefer an apartmen=
t that can be a respite from work and the rest of the city. Mostly spend =
my time at home reading and drawing. My half of the apartment has a priva=
te entrance from the hallway, so it&#39;ll be like having your own apartm=
ent most of the time.

About You: In your late 20&#39;s-30&#39;s, steadily employed or in school=
, clean, responsible, and considerate. Male or female (couples okay for a=
dditional $200 rent). Great situation for someone who needs a bit more cr=
eative/work space and enjoys a sense of privacy. Also, the rest of the ob=
vious stuff: no smoking indoors, no significant others who never leave, c=
leans their own mess, etc.=20

Showing this week before the 14th. If this sounds like a good fit, email =
me a little about yourself, what you&#39;re looking for in a roommate and=
 an apartment, and if you have any social media stuff, feel free to send =
it over.=20

$1,695.00 Per Month, Nolita, New York, Come and share our lovely Nolita A=
partment, with a roof deck!
Available: Feb 09, 2015

 Hi Everyone!

Two sisters are looking for a roommate for our lovely top floor apartment=
. It has a private roof deck and amazing views across downtown Manhattan.=


Perfect location-- minutes from SoHo, LES, and East Village. The neighbor=
hood has lots of awesome little spots to eat, drink and go out. It is a f=
ive minute walk from three subway stops- Bowery, Spring Street, and Grand=
 Street. There is laundry in the basement, a live-in superintendent who i=
s efficient and friendly. It&#39;s a very peaceful, cozy and convenient s=
pace to live in.

The room that&#39;s available is the downstairs room. It&#39;s a good siz=
ed double room, which easily fits a queen sized bed and has built in hang=
ing space and a window.

About us...
We are two sisters in our 20&#39;s. One of us works in magazine advertisi=
ng and the other works as an assistant and freelance film editor. Our job=
s require long hours so we hope that this place can maintain
a calm, welcoming, and fun atmosphere.

Please get in touch with a paragraph about yourself to see you&#39;d be a=
 good fit.

P.S. Sadly, this isn&#39;t suitable if you are just looking for somewhere=
 for only a few months. Our lease ends on August 31st, so we&#39;re looki=
ng for someone to take the room long term (i.e. at least until then, with=
 the possibility of looking into renewing the lease if you wanted to).

$1,100.00 Per Month, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 150 sq. ft., Cute Bedroom Av=
ailable In The Heart Of Williamsburg!
Available: Mar 01, 2015

I am renting a bedroom in my 2br in the middle of Williamsburg. It&#39;s =
available March 1.=20

The room is square shaped, about 12 x 12. It faces east. There is a good =
sized closet with a lot of room for storage, and enough room for a queen/=
full bed, desk, and whatever else you may want to add. The landlady allow=
s us to paint the walls so you can paint it whatever color you like, as l=
ong as you paint it back before you leave. I&#39;m thinking of repainting=
 the living room once it gets warmer out. There is a cute pink/beige-ish =
bathroom with a bathtub. The living room and kitchen are of average size.=


The location is really the best, you can&#39;t beat it. It&#39;s equidist=
ant from the L, G, and M trains, each are about a 5 minute walk away. You=
 can get nearly everything you need within a 5 minute walk or less. It&#3=
9;s close to two grocery stores, about 800 bars (Barcade, Bushwick Countr=
y Club, Burnside is across the street, Huckleberry, Noormans Kil, Lovegun=
, etc), nearly every type of food (notably exquisite ramen and Indian foo=
d), hardware store, laundromat, yoga studios, comic book stores, psychics=
, you name it.

You will be living with one 24 year old female and one 4 year old cat. I =
work full time in Manhattan so I&#39;m typically not around during the da=
y. In the evenings I&#39;m either at a yoga class, hanging out with frien=
ds, or working on various creative projects.

My ideal roommate would be: female (though not necessary), around my age,=
 clean, respectful, not a party animal. If you have a cat that&#39;d be g=
reat too, I&#39;d love a friend for mine. You don&#39;t have to sign a le=
ase but I&#39;m looking for someone who can commit to at least 3 months.

No dogs
No couples
No smoking cigs inside the apartment (pot ok)

1 month rent + 1 month deposit ($2200) to seal the deal.

If this all sounds nice to you, please reply with a little info about you=
rself along with any questions you may have!

$1,300.00 Per Month, Bed-Stuy, Br, 2000 sq. ft., Large Room In Large 2BR =
Duplex - Live/Work/Basement
Available: Mar 01, 2015

Hi. I have a large room for rent in a my two bedroom duplex apartment in =
Bed-Stuy. It is available starting March 1st. The apartment includes the =
entire ground floor and backyard of a beautiful brownstone, plus the big =
and finished basement. The place is very bright, airy and spacious.=20

The place is located on Madison st between Marcus Garvey and Lewis in Bed=
-Stuy, Brooklyn. It is a 10 minute walk from the Utica stop on the A/C tr=
ains, and a bunch of bus lines are near by. Having a bike here is easy an=
d encouraged. Street parking is available on both sides of the street.=20=


I am 35, a student at Columbia School of General Studies, and I am also a=
 musician. At school, I am studying urban planning and creative writing, =
which means I am home most of the week doing school work. I spend my spar=
e time practicing and playing music in the space I&#39;ve set up in the b=
asement. (I am pretty conscious of people&#39;s work hours). I sell recor=
ds and various music-related things online and work as a DJ, spinning 45s=
 of old rock n roll. There are a lot of records here.=20

Your bedroom is about 450 sf, and has two big windows. It was recently re=
novated by the landlord, but still has some antique elements to it. We wi=
ll share the large, open kitchen and living room, hallway, bathroom and b=
ackyard. You are welcome to use part of the basement for work, storage or=
 studio space (I use about a third for my studio), which makes this an ex=
cellent place for artists. I am happy to move things around to accommodat=
e. You are also welcome to start a garden in the backyard. We are on the =
first floor and have a private entrance.

The rent is $1300, including heat and hot water. That is similar renting =
an apartment and studio space, so you might consider this live/work. Shor=
t term or long term available. If you want to stay here for only a month =
to try it out, that&#39;s fine too.=20

If you would like to take a look, please send me a short note with info a=
bout yourself, and a few different times when you might be able to stop b=
y. I look forward to hearing from you.

Cheers,
Ben

$950.00 Per Month, Bed-Stuy/Bushwick, Brooklyn, 900 sq. ft., Roommate for=
 Large room w/ Private bathroom!
Available: Mar 01, 2015 through Jun 01, 2015

Details
Looking for a good roommate to fill out a large 3 bedroom apartment
Month to month OR long term possible
Room ca. 9&#39; x 15&#39; with closet and full private bathroom
Possibility of having room furnished
Private roof access

The Area
JMZ myrtle =3D 5 min walk (express J train is 11 minutes and 2 stops to M=
anhattan)
G =3D 10 min walk
Bike =3D 15 min to Manhattan (if you&#39;re quick), 5 min to Roberta&#39;=
s/Bushwick proper, 10 min to Williamsburg

Overall a really central location - there is also a 24 hour laundromat an=
d grocery store right by the Myrtle subway stop and tons of stores/bodega=
s/cafes along Broadway.

One thing to note, regarding this location, is that we are right next to =
a set of housing projects (which is why the price is so good for the loca=
tion). This doesn&#39;t bother me at all and you don&#39;t have to walk t=
hrough the projects to get to the subway. But just to be fully transparen=
t you should know that.

Me
I&#39;m a male artist and documentary filmmaker in my 30s, looking for pe=
ople in their late 20s or 30s to share the space with. Common interests a=
re great but if you&#39;re an interesting and decent person we&#39;ll get=
 along.

I&#39;m not often home as I work from my studio space in Manhattan, and a=
lso have a  research assistant position in the Princeton neuroscience dep=
artment that I go to two days/week.

I&#39;m outgoing and sociable but not looking for roommates who bring the=
 party home (unless it is a realllly good one). Also looking for people w=
ho enjoy living in a clean/tidy space (and are willing to do a bit of wor=
k to have it be that way), and don&#39;t work from home. Cooking/dinner p=
arties are good.

If you&#39;re interested, get in touch.

$850.00 Per Month, Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, Lovely serene and spacious roo=
m available in great apt on a great block
Available: Feb 15, 2015

For your consideration: A spacious, sunny bedroom (12x17 ft, with two lar=
ge backyard- facing windows) with hardwood floors and a roomy walk-in clo=
set. It&#39;s semi-furnished with a queen sized bed, large mirror and boo=
kshelves. Shared kitchen and bathroom only; the room has a private entran=
ce. I&#39;m a nonsmoker and prefer the same, but there is fire escape acc=
ess if you&#39;re committed to that occasional nicotine fix.=20

The apartment is a 4th floor walkup in a brownstone on lovely block that&=
#39;s conveniently located to all amenities (C and G subway lines, bus st=
ops, 24-hr laundry, supermarkets, post office, coffee shops, great restau=
rants and more are all within a 2-block radius). It&#39;s a 15-min subway=
 ride to downtown Manhattan; 1/2 hour to midtown. Prospect and Fort Green=
e Parks and Brooklyn Flea are all within walking distance. This is a perf=
ect space for someone with a busy schedule/long hours who&#39;s looking f=
or a calm space to recharge in.=20

ot an artist, and clean, with pretty decent social skills. I cook and bak=
e sporadically. Looking for someone who knows how to share space without =
needing prompts for the basics. There are non-arduous shared chores--rota=
ted cleaning of kitchen/bathroom on alternate weeks. I don&#39;t mind if =
there&#39;s someone spending the night once in while but every other nigh=
t (or worse, every night) would not be OK.=20

An even-keeled and friendly cat is also in residence.

Rent includes utilities (wifi, gas and electric). Feb 15 or March 1st OK =
for move in. I do require a one-month security deposit upon move in, and =
would prefer a minimum six-month stay (a longer stay is possible if the v=
ibes are right).=20

Cheers to you, and good luck with your apartment search!

Hi!

I&#39;m looking for a roommate in my apartment. It&#39;s a super convenie=
nt location in South Williamsburg- 5 minute walk to the JMZ and a little =
under 10 to the L train.=20
It&#39;s a cozy, beautifully lit spot.=20

I&#39;m open to a bunch of options! A month stay, an open-ended thing, et=
c. The room (that&#39;s pictured empty) is furnished with a bed, lamp, dr=
esser and rug but I don&#39;t have a picture because my current roommate =
(and her things) are in there...To be  honest, it&#39;d be ideal if you w=
ere not planning on bringing too much furniture.=20

Couple things about the place (and me):=20

I work a bunch and probably want to live with someone who keeps the same =
amount of busy as I do.=20

On the scale of 1 to annoyingly-clean-and-organized-and-sparse- I lean to=
wards the annoyingly clean and organized and sparse.=20
=20
So. That&#39;s it. Let&#39;s chat. My pics don&#39;t really do the place =
justice- it&#39;s a great spot. I&#39;m just looking for a competent, rea=
lly kind, independent, fun, clean person that I don&#39;t find depressing=
!=20

I know searching for housing is tough- I&#39;ll do my best to be really p=
rompt and clear on my end. I&#39;ll likely get back to you this weekend..=
.so don&#39;t sweat it if I don&#39;t immediately respond...

$900.00 Per Month, Sunset Park, Brooklyn, Approx. 130 sq. ft., Spacious a=
nd sunny 2 bedroom share in Sunset Park
Available: Mar 01, 2015

I&#39;m looking for a roommate for 3/1 for my gorgeous apartment in Sunse=
t Park.
I&#39;m on 40th Street between 6th and 7th Avenues. Floor through apartme=
nt in a semi detached row house - lots of light! It&#39;s so sunny it is =
hard to photograph during the day.

Tons of plants, my cat Miss California, Chicken &amp; Chorizo the parakee=
ts, and Frank Finatra the fish. No other dogs or cats please but someone =
in a tank/cage/bowl would be welcome!

Rent is $900/month + $75 for wifi/gas/electric. I&#39;ve got level billin=
g so no surprises. The room is about 11&#39;x11&#39; with one window and =
presently comfortably holds a queen sized bed, two large dressers, an end=
 table, and a large book case. Comes unfurnished. Decent sized closet for=
 your use is in the hall.

Shared spaces include a cozy eat in kitchen with lots of storage, a perfe=
ctly nice bathroom with a full tub, a huge living room with a Roku, a lar=
ge entrance room that could easily accommodate a desk if you had one or a=
 bookshelf, and a big walk-in closet for things like coats/air conditione=
rs/holiday ornaments/suitcases/etc.

I&#39;ve been here going on three years, land lord is upstairs and very s=
weet. It&#39;s a really homey block where people look out for each other&=
#39;s kids and socialize on the stoops in summer.

I&#39;m 30, Puerto Rican, from Jersey City. I work full time in administr=
ation at The Met and tend to go to bed early. I&#39;m gone 7:30ish to 7:3=
0ish every day. I cook a lot! I smoke but never in the house. I drink som=
etimes in the house, and will have a friend over for dinner once a week o=
r so but nothing rowdy.

My cat is elderly and sweet. Her litter box is in my bedroom so you won&#=
39;t have to deal with it at all, and she won&#39;t go in your bedroom un=
less invited. She&#39;d happily cuddle with you if permitted though!

Hopefully you are a cat lover, employed, tidy, ok with being considerate =
of noise after 11pm on weeknights and would like to watch Doctor Who with=
 me sometimes. It would be great if you could provide proof of employment=
 and/or a few recent pay stubs. Ideally you are established here and not =
brand new to the city.

To keep everything above board: I attend Al Anon regularly and am not abl=
e to share my living space with alcoholics, in recovery or otherwise.

The apartment is fully stocked and I have everything you could want short=
 of a blender. Bonus if you come with one!

To review: March 1st $975/month (rent+utilities) with a $900 refundable s=
ecurity deposit paid to the land lord.

No lease, it&#39;s month to month. Land lord would give me a lease if I a=
sked but I like the flexibility.

Please reply with some info about yourself, where you&#39;re living now, =
how long  you&#39;re looking to stay, etc. Thanks!

$950.00 Per Month, Gramercy, New York, roommate needed for affordable 3 b=
edroom in Gramercy-  March 1
Available: Mar 01, 2015 through Feb 29, 2016

Looking for a new roommate! =20

March 1 for one year.  25th at 3rd Ave. =20

I&#39;m renewing my lease for another year.  This apartment is a great fi=
nd.  It&#39;s probably the cheapest rent in Gramercy for such a decent sp=
ot.=20

About the apartment:
3 bedroom with kitchen and bathroom.  The kitchen is really the only shar=
ed space, but it has plenty of room for cooking, and having dinner with a=
 couple people.  Each room has windows and gets plenty of light.=20

The super lives in the building and has been very helpful with fixing any=
thing. There&#39;s a safe area behind the building where you can store a =
bicycle, so if you have one you won&#39;t have to carry it up and down th=
e stairs. =20

I&#39;m looking for one person to renew the lease with me.  The thing tha=
t makes this place amazing is the deal we have on rent- the rent for the =
whole apartment is $3,200/ month.  I&#39;ve furnished the 3rd room and su=
blet it out month to month or air bnb style.  So to move in, we share the=
 rent and security deposit, then we just make sure the 3rd room is rented=
 out each month, so that our rent is just $950/mo each. =20

The only other expenses are TWC wifi which is $35/ month and Con Edison i=
s usually about $100/month total. Heat is included, and we use window AC =
units. =20

About me: =20
I&#39;m a 30 year old creative professional, I moved to NYC from Baltimor=
e almost 3 years ago.  I work in marketing and events, and also bartend p=
art time it a great little wine bar nearby. =20

I&#39;m a clean and easy going roommate.  I actually am in my room a lot =
when I am home, because I&#39;m not home that often.  I love to cook and =
I also play music.=20

About your room:
It&#39;s about 12 x 14 ft, with 2 windows, a radiator, and pocket doors, =
so you don&#39;t lose any floor space when doors are open.  The ceilings =
are decently high at 12- 13 ft. =20

** I have a cat- He&#39;s a Himalayan, he&#39;s old and declawed, sleeps =
most the day, and spends most time in my room.  The apartment is small, s=
o I don&#39;t think bringing another pet is a good idea. =20

$1,400.00 Per Month, Gramercy, New York, 500 sq. ft., cute, cozy, private=
 room in #2 bed/1 bath gramercy appartment
Available: Feb 10, 2015

i&#39;m a visual artist who works freelance on photoshoots and in the fas=
hion industry. my second bedroom is available for rent, fully furnished, =
and i&#39;d love to find a stable, responsible, and friendly person to re=
nt it, short- or long-term. the room is available immediately.
=20
your total monthly housing budget including a reasonable amount for utili=
ties and incidentals, should be around $1575. the apartment has high spee=
d internet, renters insurance on the apartment, and water filters in both=
 the shower and the kitchen. i try to keep the home as &quot;green&quot; =
as possible, using healthy cleaning products, etc., even if they cost a l=
ittle more. the room is fully furnished (full bed, dresser, desk, and arm=
oire,) with a window onto the quiet side yard. the apartment is cozy with=
 high ceilings and bedrooms on opposite ends of the apartment, so, althou=
gh it is not large, it&#39;s quite comfortable for two people to share an=
d enjoy a bit of privacy. the apartment is on a low floor (not a lot of s=
tairs to climb) and in a convenient area, just a few blocks from lots of =
green space, gyms, yoga, cycling &amp; pilates studios, all kinds of rest=
aurants and food shops, plus some really cool bars and cafes. plus, we&#3=
9;re one stop on the L from williamsburg, and one or two stops from soho,=
 chelsea, grand central, etc.=20

the union square green market is nearby and is actually one of the reason=
s i first moved into this apartment. i love to cook but tend towards the =
very simple and season driven... i&#39;ve also been thinking of joining t=
he east village food co-op, but I&#39;m waiting to see if my new roommate=
 wants to join, too. that said, i don&#39;t mind if you live on chinese t=
akeout and i&#39;ll recommend a good place! for fun, i attend lots of art=
, music, and fashion industry events, travel as much as time and budget a=
llow, and volunteer now and then with various arts organizations.
=20
i&#39;ve lived with friends as often as not, and prefer living with other=
 creative people who enjoy sharing space as well as housing costs. i have=
 lived in the city a long time and travel a lot for work and pleasure, bu=
t i am also a social person and enjoy good conversation, a spontaneous me=
al, and the like with a roommate from time to time. sometimes i&#39;ll wo=
rk from home and, on the flip side, sometimes i am gone for days or weeks=
 at a time. i hope you&#39;ll be okay with either one. when i am home, i&=
#39;m usually on my computer, reading, or listening to music or wnyc. i l=
ike to relax at home and have tried to create a place that is conducive t=
o that. no tv in the living room, but lots of books and a stereo, instead=
. that, and a tree-filled, generally quiet neighborhood help to make this=
 a very nice place to relax and unwind.
=20
without a wide-angle lens it&#39;s hard to get good photos of the apartme=
nt but i hope you can get an idea from these images. please let me know i=
f you&#39;re interested in meeting and seeing the place! i&#39;m showing =
it asap.

$1,400.00 Per Month, Financial District, Manhattan, Large Flex Room in Hi=
gh Rise
Available: Feb 14, 2015 through Jul 01, 2015

The Room:

The available space is a flex room separated off from the living room. Th=
e living room is rather large so, even with the division, there is still =
a traditional living room space. The room is large and has 10 ft ceilings=
, its own A/C and heating unit, and easily fits a full/queen-sized bed an=
d has room for a desk or other things you might have. The floor-to-ceilin=
g windows offer plenty of light and a pretty awesome view to wake up to. =
What&#39;s great is that we separated the room with a large closet wall. =
It&#39;s the equivalent of three closets, so you&#39;d have more than eno=
ugh space for your clothes. The downside is that it is not a full wall. A=
lthough the closet wall is huge, you&#39;d have to close it off further i=
f you wanted to make it more secluded since there is no door. The last tw=
o roommates didn&#39;t really mind it, but there are plenty of creative w=
ays to seal it off which would be up to your discretion.=20

The Building:

It is a doorman building with a gym, yoga studio, concierge, billiards ro=
om, club room, indoor pool, in-building laundry, several patios, and a 53=
rd story roof deck with beautiful views of the city. The building is foot=
steps from Seaport and Stone Street, offering plenty of great food and dr=
inking options. When you want to get away, the building is near both the =
Fulton Street and Wall Street stations, offering access to the A,C,E,1,2,=
3,4,5,6,J,Z,R, and the Path.  Times Square and Grand Central is about 15 =
minutes away.=20

The Roommate (me):

I&#39;m a 29-year-old lawyer (former teacher) and work nearby in the Fina=
ncial District. I work typical business hours, though I often come home l=
ate. I&#39;m respectful, dependable, communicative, clean, and generally =
quiet. I&#39;m definitely past my college years, but I&#39;m also not a h=
ermit. I enjoy legal things, coffee, movies, reading, sarcasm, Netflix ni=
ghts, politics, bars over clubs, and traveling.=20

You:

I&#39;m looking for a dependable, stable, mature, and respectful roommate=
. Someone who is tidy and knows how to share an apartment. It&#39;s easy =
to list off adjectives, but I basically want to live with someone that I =
can get along with or hang out with. I&#39;m not looking for a best frien=
d, but I also don&#39;t want to live with a stranger. A big part of this =
search is to see if we&#39;d be a good fit.  I have no hangups regarding =
potential roommates (sex/orientation/race/politics, etc.) as that&#39;s w=
here the respectful part comes in. (Though if you&#39;re a Republican kno=
w that I&#39;m a progressive vegetarian, so my mere existence might frigh=
ten you.)=20

The Deets:

The lease runs through July 1st, 2015 with an option to renew, and is ren=
t stabilized. I&#39;m hoping for someone long term, to finish the lease w=
ith (though I will probably renew anyway). I&#39;m looking for: first mon=
th (February/prorated), one thousand for security, and $400 for the wall =
closet (it cost more than 1k to get). So, $2125 to move in. There is also=
 a possibility of a March 1 move (let me know if that&#39;s what you&#39;=
re interested in).

If you are interested, please email me with some details about you (e.g.,=
 profession, personality, random thoughts, haikus, presidential race pred=
ictions). A social media link would also be great so I know you aren&#39;=
t a computer. Feel free to ask me any questions as well. I&#39;m hoping t=
o meet and show the place throughout the week/weekend.

Thanks for reading and good luck hunting. Everyone deserves a medal for s=
uccessfully finding a place in NYC.

$700.00 Per Month, Crown Heights, Brooklyn, 1 Large Bedroom Avail in 4 Be=
droom Brownstone of Late 20's/Early 30's Creative People
Available: Mar 01, 2015

We are looking for a wonderful new roommate for our 4 bedroom Brownstone =
in Crown Heights for March 1st!=20

About the Apartment:
- The bedroom is large (around 14&#39; x 11&#39; ... maybe larger).
- The apartment is huge. We have the top 2 floors (and roof) of a brownst=
one. So there is plenty of communal space. We have a separate entrance an=
d 2 full floors (one floor is just a huge living room, a dining room, kit=
chen, w/d, closets, etc), upper floor is the 4 bedrooms &amp; bathroom (s=
hared by only 3 of the 4 roommates). Then roof above that and landing bel=
ow the 1st floor.
- There&#39;s a washer/dryer in unit
- We are 1 block away from the 2 &amp; 5 train at President Street Stop (=
which is only one stop past Franklin Ave) or a few blocks from the 3 at N=
ostrand.
- Utilities are probably around $100 a month

About Us:
- 29 y/o writer/cinematographer, early 30s actor, &amp; mid-20&#39;s musi=
c industry employee.

To Move In:
- $700 1st month&#39;s rent, $700 last month rent, and the outgoing roomm=
ate is asking to have her security deposit bought out for $500.

What we are looking for:
- A friendly person who can both get along with living with roommates, bu=
t also not mind that the apartment is often quiet because of everyone&#39=
;s different schedules.
- We range from our mid 20&#39;s to early 30&#39;s, so we are looking for=
 another person in that age range that would fit well in here. With reaso=
nable rent we get a lot of interest from younger people, but we are hopin=
g to find someone who wants to save the money they normally pay on rent a=
nd put it toward their art, making the apartment better, and living well!=

- We&#39;d prefer to find a female roommate (not necessary). But we are 2=
 man and 1 woman, so a balanced apartment has worked out nice.
- We&#39;d love someone who is interested in creating a better home. The =
apartment has tons of potential.
- It&#39;s easy for an apartment of busy creatives to stay pretty quiet w=
ith all our different schedules. We are always looking for someone to bri=
ng energy and life into the place!

$1,200.00 Per Month, Lefferts Gardens, Brooklyn, Sublet Two Rooms
Available: Feb 15, 2015 through Aug 15, 2015

Hi everyone,

I am looking to sublet two rooms in my 3 bedroom apartment. You would be =
subletting the two rooms at the front of the apartment. My bedroom is in =
the back of the apartment. There is also a living room between my room an=
d the front rooms, so plenty of space and privacy.

I am a woman in my late 30s.  I am an artist and freelance designer.  My =
schedule varies.  When I&#39;m home I like to cook, make art, read and me=
ditate.

I am looking to share this apartment with someone who is friendly, respon=
sible and respectful.  This is a 6 month sublet with the possibility of e=
xtending to a year.

Here are some more details:

The apartment is a corner lot and has gated tree filled yards along the s=
ide and back. The apartment is on the first floor of a two family house. =
The bedrooms and living room all have windows and natural light. The bath=
room and eat-in kitchen are also quite spacious. It is across the street =

y with 9 different subway lines (d/m/n/r/b/q/2/3/4/5) &amp; the Long Isla=
nd Railroad. The a/c and the g lines are about 6 blocks further). The ren=
tal is close to the new Barclays Center as well as Prospect Park, centere=
d at the convergence of several awesome neighborhoods (Park Slope/Gowanus=
/Downtown Brooklyn/Boerum Hill/Fort Greene) All photos in the ad are of t=
he private room. I have more of the rest of the apartment and would be ha=
ppy to send them if interested.

-Can be occupied March 1st (possibly earlier) and is available for 3 - 6 =
months (some possibility of extension). The space is a little set off fro=
m the rest of the apartment, toward the front and up one step. It is larg=
e size (apprx 15x12), with two windows overlooking 4th Ave, and is set up=
 studio-style. There&#39;s a breakfast bar area with seating, coffee pres=
s, hot pot, small convection oven and a mini fridge. In the living room c=
orner there&#39;s a modern sofa &amp; reading chair (converts to a twin b=
ed for guests) as well as a study space with desk, chair &amp; bookshelf.=
 A full sized bed fits into a curtained alcove and storage is provided vi=
a slatwall shelves &amp; hanging bars just outside the door. Personal spa=
ce heater/AC units &amp; Wifi included. I also provide all bedroom linens=
 paper goods and cleaning supplies (sheets/towels/pillows/blankets/toilet=
 paper/paper towels).

-The apartment has 2 bathrooms, 3 bedrooms, office, full communal kitchen=
/hangout area, with all the usual dishes, etc for your use. You would onl=
y have to share the bathroom with one other person. The apartment is very=
 clean, and the decor is eclectic and urban. It&#39;s a former law office=
 renovated into an funky apartment - a very cool place!

-Rent is $1375 plus $100 for all utilities. To move in I require full pay=
ment of 1st month &amp; 1/2 of last month up-front and a copy of a valid =
photo ID.=20

-The living environment is independent, quiet but social, very relaxed an=
d chill vibe. I am seeking someone who is respectful and friendly, with a=
 mature attitude, good communication skills, busy schedule and a tendency=
 toward neatness. (I am especially serious about cleanliness and have nev=
er had an issue with bugs or rodents of any kind). No smoking, no pets.

I am a mature professional female, I work from home and travel regularly.=
 I reside in a separate suite in the rear of the apartment with my own pr=
ivate space, it has a bedroom/office/bathroom/kitchenette/patio, so there=
 is limited sharing.

Please tell me a little about yourself and what your schedule is like. Pl=
ease provide a contact number if your inquiry is serious and you would li=
ke me to respond and I will do the same. Thank you!

This is a quiet, freshly renovated railroad style apartment with high cei=

ck in Sunset Park, Brooklyn (3 blocks from the park itself). It&#39;s the=
 2nd floor of a 3-story brownstone. Open layout so it&#39;s best for a co=
uple, but could easily accommodate 2 roommates (or individual who wants a=
 lot of space).  No pets. Heat and water included, and the apartment come=
s with 2 window-mount air conditioners. The apartment is unfurnished. R s=

The renter would take over our lease until July, with the option to renew=
 for the same price. First month &amp; 1 month security deposit required.=
 Landlord lives in the building. Available immediately.

I am the current renter who is in process of moving out. My lease is up i=

They use a standard boilerplate lease agreement This is a no-fee apartmen=
t. My lease for $1875 isn&#39;t up until July, so we&#39;re simply lookin=
g for a person to take it over, and if they&#39;d like to renew the lease=
 in July, the landlord agrees to keep it the same price. So to move-in, t=
he renter will need to put down 1st month rent and a 1-month security dep=
osit.

$2,250.00 Per Month, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, 330 sq. ft., Affordable, huge =
apartment in the heart of amazing Greenpoint
Available: Mar 01, 2015 through Mar 01, 2016

My roommate and I are looking for a new tenant to take over the lease in =
our incredible Greenpoint apartment come March 1st... with a small catch.=
 Curious? Read on!
=20
The apartment is $2,250 per month (i.e. a total bargain). Its a 2 bed/2 b=
ath located smack bang in the middle of Greenpoint (Nassau at Leonard). C=
lose to bars/shops/all things cool. 2 min to Nassau G, 10 min to Bedford =
L. Both rooms have closets and are big enough for queen beds and a couch.=
 Theres a small kitchen with enough room for a table and chairs. Tall cei=
lings, big gas stove, floorboards throughout. The back room opens onto a =
fire escape, great for summer lounging.
=20
Heres the catch: I (Georgia) am still there until July 1. Were struck a d=
eal with our landlord that I find a new tenant, they take over the lease =
and move into my roommate&#39;s room (the second bedroom in the pictures,=
 the one with the exposed brick walls). Then I sublet off the new tenants=
 for fours months, then I move out, and you take over the whole apartment=
. (The second bedroom room is $1062.50, mine is $1187.50.) For this reaso=
n, itd suit a couple or single person willing to compromise on space for =
a few months, with the understanding Im outta there come July. Two friend=
s is possible, but know youd have to either share the front room, or be o=
n the lease but have one person not living in the apartment until July. I=
ts actually perfect for a couple or single person: my room could be your =
bedroom and the front room could be a home office/kids room/lounge room e=
tc. And once youre in, youre in: weve been there for 3 years and the past=
 tenants were there for 7.
=20
We love our apartment and hopefully the fact its a bargain in BKs hottest=
 neighborhood makes up for the weird transition stuff. Right? Right! Gree=
npoint is safe, fun, and way more interesting than Manhattan. (Yes, it&#3=
9;s where Lena lives in Girls). You&#39;ll be surrounded by galleries, bo=
utiques and the best restaurants and cafes in BK! McCarren Park is two bl=
ocks away with a large green space, playgrounds, running track and a Farm=
er&#39;s Market on Saturdays.

Prospective tenants need to present pay stubs/proof of employment, letter=
 of recommendation from current tenant and be able to pass a credit check=
. Our landlord is great so I definitely want to hook him up with someone =
reliable.=20

I&#39;m an Australian writer, easy-going, friendly, after someone cool to=
 share the space with before I clear out in July. I&#39;m at my girlfrien=
d&#39;s half the week.  Just clean up after yourselves and we&#39;re all =
good. There&#39;s no real hang-out/communal space -- the kitchen is small=
 -- so it&#39;s kind of a &#39;you do your thing, I&#39;ll do my thing&#3=
9; vibe. I sometimes have friends stay, so I don&#39;t mind if you do tha=
t either.=20

This is a &#39;first in, best dressed&#39; scenario, so if you&#39;re kee=
n email me asap! Tell me about yourself, what you do in NY (you have to b=
e here to sign the lease in person), any links you have to your website/L=
inked In. I&#39;m actually overseas right now, so my roommate will show y=
ou the place, then you&#39;ll meet my Polish landlord to sign the paperwo=
rk. Guys, this place is the bomb! It&#39;s so freaking cheap for Greenpoi=
nt and the back room is huge! Jump on it!

$1,599.00 Per Month, Cypress Hills/Highland Park, Brooklyn, Sunny newly r=
enovated 2-bedroom (could be used as 3-br), with garage option
Available: Feb 01, 2015

A very bright, sunny apartment on the second floor of a two-family home  =
- 2 blocks away from Highland Park (a 140-acre greenspace with jogging pa=
ths, a resevoir &amp; various athletic courts).=20

Newly renovated apartment. Brand new kitchen with butcher block counter. =
Hardwood floor throughout.

There are three rooms that are completely separate from each other - it c=
ould be either used as a 2-bedroom apartment, or a 3-bedroom (in that cas=
e foregoing having a living room). Two of the rooms are large, one is sma=
ll.  Two of the rooms have two light exposures (this is a corner house).=20=


Shared small outdoor space: a porch, as well as a sliver of garden space =
around the perimeter of the house (enough to have a bench, grill &amp; a =
party/gathering!)

There is also a garage on the property, which is an option if you are int=
erested - it would be an additional $100 per month (not inclusive in the =
$1599) You could use it for your car, and creative types - you&#39;re wel=
come to use it for storing your tools/supplies/projects, although I doubt=
 you&#39;d want to use it as a studio as the garage is not heated and doe=
s not have much light.=20

Cross streets: Hendrix St &amp; Sunnyside Ave (which is beautiful! google=
 streetview it!)=20
Closest transport: J/Z train 4 blocks away (Van Siclen station), also an =
option: Broadway Junction station (A, C, J, Z &amp; L trains) which is a =
15 minute walk.=20

Neighborhood is quiet and full of greenery &amp; flowers in the spring/su=
mmer. Heat &amp; hot water included.
1st month&#39;s rent &amp; 1 month&#39;s deposit to move in - NO FEE, ren=
ted by owner. Pets are considered on a case by case basis. I am the owner=
 of this apartment and also live in the same house and will be showing it=
 personally. There is a $40 per person application fee and I ask for tax =
returns and pay stubs as part of the application process

My lovely one-bedroom apartment is on one of the most beautiful blocks in=
 Brooklyn. It&#39;s on the third floor (walk up) of an elegant brownstone=
 one door down from Ft Greene Park and two minutes walk from great coffee=

mperature controlled heat all throughout so it stays quite warm even thou=
gh most spaces this large can typically get cold in the winter. This plac=

ke this in NYC, especially the size. Its unique and artistic details are =
designed everywhere into the house. One of the walls is made of entirely =
of old windows and found objects. Another wall is made of a net of tiny w=

There are 2 other roommates.  Mature, nice, easy going, respectable and c=
onsiderate.  One is a PHD student and other a graphics.  The vibe of the =
house is mellow.  We dont have a own a tv and its more conducive to readi=
ng, listening to music and hanging out with your laptop, rather than part=
ying.  We are social types but we also know when to keep to ourselves and=
 be quiet.  The loft is eclectic and tidy.  Non smokers. No pets.=20

$1,500.00 Per Month, Astoria, Williamsburg, Greenpoint, UWS, New York Cit=
y, Seeking a roommate for two bedroom share
Available: Mar 15, 2015

In January of this year I moved from Portland, OR to NYC to take a positi=
on with Doctors without Borders. Ive been working with Doctors without Bo=
rders internationally now for three years and most recently spent a year =
in Amman, Jordan.  I took a position in their NYC office and have discove=
red the challenge of finding a place to live in NYC. To add to this chall=
enge I own a dog. My dad has kept my dog for the last year, but he is now=
 in NYC with me  learning to be a city dog. Fortunately, he is super cute=
 so we have had good luck with taxis when I&#39;ve needed to transport hi=
m.  He is a loving, charming 10 year old Golden Retriever, but despite hi=
s endearing personality, finding a place to rent remains a challenge. I a=
m currently in a sublet, but would like to find a place to call home by M=
arch 15 as I am tired of living out of suitcase.

I have found in my search that there are more two bedrooms within my pric=
e range ($1500) that allow dogs. So I thought I might have better luck ad=
vertising for roommate to share a 2-bedroom apartment.  The areas I like =
so far are UWS near the park (where I am subletting), Williamsburg, Green=
point, and Astoria. Im flexible to areas, but am looking for a place clos=
e to a park and where I feel secure to walk my dog late night at night.  =
Close to cafes, yoga studios, organic stores, good places to eat, and gro=
cery stores a bonus!

In terms of who I think would be fit is someone who leaves the party outs=
ide (as I read from so many ads) and who does not bring their hookups hom=
e or make their partner the third roommate. I&#39;m usually up early on t=
he weekdays so would like someone with a similar schedule (sleep patterns=
). Personally, I am past my party days, but I do like an occasional dinne=
r party with friends that include good conversation,  good wine, cocktail=
s, card and/or board games. I&#39;m not necessarily a neat freak, but do =
like a clean place, which means dishes done, counters wiped, bathroom cle=
an.  I take full responsibility for my dog and recently bought a vacuum a=
s the place I am subletting didn&#39;t have one and with a shedder for a =
dog, frequent vacuuming is a necessity.  I won&#39;t expect you to be res=
ponsible for his care, unless you volunteer and even then not likely to t=
ake you up on it very often. In general home for me is a place where I re=
charge my batteries so am looking for someone who shares and/or respects =
this view.  Im new to NYC so lots to discover and explore. I am eager to =
end the hunt for a place to live so I can establish a routine. I hope to =
get back to regular yoga, photography classes, cooking classes, and whate=
ver else might surface. I own a condo in VT that needs some renovations s=
o will spend some weekends there as well.  If this sounds like a fit, ple=
ase send me an email with a bit about you.
