re expanding the number of studios in the building. I will be the one sho=
wing the spaces and there are absolutely NO fees involved.

$500.00 Per Month, Clinton Hill, New York, 210 sq. ft., Charming, Stimula=
ting Work Space/Share in Newly Renovated Building
Available: Dec 15, 2014 through Jun 15, 2015

I am looking for an artist/designer/writer/architect/photographer/video e=
ditor to share this beautiful, floor-to-ceiling exposed brick space. This=
 is a quiet, professional atmosphere to get work done and/or have studio =
visits.

The studio is located in an old doll factory near the Brooklyn Navy Yards=
. There is a slop sink, multiple outlets, and heat/AC located inside the =
studio. There is also one large window (approx. 65 x 48&quot;) in the stu=
dio, facing south.

The building has recently been renovated and offers 24-hour access, a ser=
vice elevator, multiple bathrooms on each floor, a video intercom system,=
 and security cameras throughout. Many restaurants, cafes, delis, and an =
art supply store within walking distance. Clinton-Washington G is nearest=
 subway stop.

I am a 30-year-old multi-disciplinary artist currently working in drawing=
 and video.
Ideally, I am looking for someone whose schedule does not conflict with m=
y own and whose work can be kept fairly contained (105 sq. ft. to yoursel=
f). The space probably wouldn&#39;t work for a painter or sculptor. I wor=
k four days a week so really the space will be available to you most of t=
he time. I generally use the space on Mondays, early mornings, evenings, =
and one alternating weekend day. The hours of availability will be the fo=
llowing:

Monday, TBD
Tues- Fri, 9:00am - 7:00pm
Saturday or Sunday, (full day alternating)

There will be some flexibility also, and this will be worked out/clarifie=
d in more detail later on. The space can also be re-arranged to suit both=
 of our needs. The rent is $500 including utilities and WiFi. Please cont=
act me for more information and to schedule a viewing

$600.00 Per Month, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, 200 sq. ft., Charming office/stu=

Available: Jan 01, 2015

A semi-private space is available for sublease in my studio beginning Jan=
uary 1st, approximately 200 square feet for $600, utilities included (hea=
t &amp; electricity). The ceilings are 11 feet high, so it feels larger. =
The entire 600 sq foot studio is shared with two other people - my space =
is in the back and completely private with a door, while your space is in=
 the middle, divided from the other studio with a partial wall, which goe=
s all the way up to the ceiling. There are no windows, but abundant wall =
space and a small storage loft. Perfect for a painter.

The charming space has one exposed brick wall, and original details of wo=
od ceiling, beams and floor. It feels very comfortable and homey in there=
, great place to work. The photos feature my previous studiomates&#39; st=
uff, but it&#39;s best to take a look at it in person and see how you wou=
ld set it up yourself.

There is a freight elevator, mailbox, slop sink, clean bathrooms, and 24-=
hour access to building. Many artists and creative professionals in the b=
uilding.

Amazing, prime location, just 2 blocks from the G at Greenpoint Ave and w=
alking distance to tons of great bars, shops, and restaurants.

I prefer someone with a quiet practice - no woodworking (occasional is ok=
), loud machines, or toxic materials. It&#39;s also preferable if you wor=
k mostly nights and weekends since I work mostly weekdays, but not a requ=
isite. Also, I&#39;m only renting to an individual to keep the # of peopl=
e in the space to a minimum, no duos or groups. I require first month&#39=
;s rent plus 2 months security deposit. The lease is for one year, but if=
 you need to leave before then, you can give me 45 days notice.=20

$350.00 Per Month, Soho, Little Italy, Manhattan, 150 sq. ft., unusual he=

Available: Dec 24, 2014

I have a beautiful new studio/office I use for body-work, i.e. massage, e=
tc. that I would like to share/offer to another healing practitioner.=20
It&#39;s on Broome just below Bowery so it&#39;s convenient to the JM/ NR=
Q/ BD/ and 6 trains.=20
My space is up a flight of easy, wide stairs on a floor with 4 other arti=
sts.=20
The space has new walls, a new wood floor, a silver-leaf door, and a beau=
tiful skylight! It&#39;s serene.=20
The room is about 150sq. ft. so there&#39;s ample room for a small group =
(2-3), like for Pilates or Yoga.=20
I have a small seating area, yoga mats, a desk, file cabinet, an Ikea cre=
denza for sheets, and my bodywork table.=20
Otherwise, it has a bohemian atmosphere very different than a healing cen=
ter/office type one. It&#39;s so refreshing having a whole studio to your=
self for this kind of work. Outside my space it&#39;s NOT pristine, like =
I say, it is an artists building, but it&#39;s cool. There is no waiting =
room. The bathroom isn&#39;t super fancy either, but it&#39;s quite new a=
nd very clean. My clients love the space and find it a comfortable settin=
g for receiving bodywork. I don&#39;t play music, but you could if you wa=
nt.=20
The neighborhood is hip and lively and there are a variety of cafes and e=
ateries close by.=20
The space would be ideal for Feldenkrais, Rolfing, Alexander technique, M=
assage, private yoga, Reflexology, Acupuncture, etc.

together and feel safe/comfortable leaving your workstation setup here. I=
t&#39;s as much your space, as it is for the other 3 people you&#39;d be =
sharing with.

$1,150.00 Per Month, Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, Beautiful, Spacious, Lig=
ht-Filled, Renovated 1BR in 3BR
Available: Jan 01, 2015

Hello apartment seekers! One of my two roommates is leaving at the end of=
 this month and we need to find a new lady to take her place / finish out=
 her lease. We are looking for someone to move in at the beginning of Jan=
uary (room will be available the last week of December, so moving in earl=
y is an option and encouraged) and stay, at least, through September. Our=
 lease begins anew on October 1st of next year, and you will have the opt=
ion of sticking around and adding your name to it then. Only gals need ap=
ply.

We live on the border of Prospect Heights and Clinton Hill in a spacious,=
 renovated apartment. The neighborhood, if you&#39;re unfamiliar with it,=
 is a dream. More bars and restaurants than you could ever visit in a lif=
etime of living here. Ample Hills, which has got the greatest ice cream i=
n the universe. Chuko Ramen, Hot Bird, Little Brother BBQ, Gen Sushi, etc=
. etc. etc. Prospect Park is just a few-minute walk, as is the Grand Army=
 Plaza Farmer&#39;s Market, the Brooklyn Public Library, Brooklyn Museum,=
 and, well, all sorts of other stuff.

The place is about a block and a half from the C train, which&#39;ll take=
 you right into the city. The G train is a 10-minute walk (or you can jus=
t transfer to the G, easily, at Hoyt-Schermerhorn). We&#39;ve got a nice =
big living room (with A/C in the warm months), a fully loaded kitchen, an=
 eating area with table and two bathrooms. I redecorated a few months bac=
k, and the place is full of mid-century furniture and has got something o=
f an autumnal vibe. We&#39;ve got an impressive record and book collectio=
n, and some cheery plants.=20

The room for rent is the largest of the three and it has its own bathroom=
 (toilet, no shower; we share the main shower). It can fit a queen-sized =
bed, a dresser and an armoire. It&#39;s got a closet, too. All of the fur=
niture in the room is for sale, so if you&#39;re in the market, please me=
ntion that in your response to the ad. Cost is $1150/month + utilities/In=
ternet, which never come out to more than an additional $55/month. The la=
ndlord requires a security deposit as well, in the amount of one month&#3=
9;s rent. There are only two apartments in the building: this one and the=
 one upstairs, which houses a trio of really nice, friendly dudes. There =
is laundry (!!) in the basement. The room and the apartment itself have l=
arge windows and are filled with light.

We are two women in our late twenties and though we keep different schedu=
les, we&#39;ve become good friends and hang out when we can. I&#39;m a jo=
urnalist and she is a city planner and passionate cyclist. My roommate&#3=
9;s out of the house from early morning until around 6:30pm. I sometimes =
work from home, sometimes from a cafe down the street. We don&#39;t often=
 have tons of people over, but I&#39;ll sometimes throw dinner parties an=
d other types of get-togethers. I&#39;d like to keep this a pretty social=
 space; we listen to music in the living room, watch movies on laptops, i=
nvite the guys down from upstairs, etc. Would be great to get a third lad=
y in here who is fun, easygoing, responsible and will occasionally kick b=
ack with us at the end of the day with a bottle of red.=20

Shoot me an email, tell me a bit about yourself and let&#39;s set up a ti=
me to meet, soon! Would love to put the right person into this room at th=
e end of the month.

Thanks,

Hillary

$1,200.00 Per Month, South Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 800 sq. ft., 1 Bedroom=
 Available in South Williamsburg -- Bright Light &amp; Open Space
Available: Jan 15, 2015

Hello!
Our roommate is headed abroad, so the nicest bedroom in our 3br apartment=
 is suddenly available. We&#39;re two easy going girls who keep a clean h=
ome and take things pretty easy. Could you tell us a little about somethi=
ng you love, or something you do, and a little bit about your schedule at=
 home?

Helpful stuff:
* 1 bedroom available for month-to-month lease in South Williamsburg, ren=
t $1200 + utilities. Available January 15th.
* 1st month and security to move in. Amazing transportation, food etc, al=
l within a few minutes walk. We smoke outside the apartment, but never in=
side.
* The living room and kitchen are fully furnished with everything you nee=
d.=20
* There is a construction site one block down, but it doesn&#39;t bother =
us really. This is New York after all. We are on the top floor, and the s=
ounds are all the mild sort: horns and rumbles, no earth shaking stuff. N=
ever at night, only when we&#39;re up for work anyway, it just hasn&#39;t=
 been an issue for any of us.
* There&#39;s a cat. She&#39;s great.

The Room:
* Has a fireplace, 13-foot ceilings, and striking gold afternoon and even=
ing light. We&#39;re one block from the river.
* Also a tall window, a built in closet, a pretty Noguchi lamp on a dimme=
r, exposed brick (the nice kind), and room for a full or queen bed and on=
e or two small pieces of furniture.

About us:
One of us is a film colorist from Switzerland, the other works with fabri=
cs and hails from France. When we&#39;re not working, we like to cook din=
ner, watch a film, or stumble around the neighborhood for drinks and good=
 times. If we&#39;re honest, we&#39;d like to find someone who doesn&#39;=
t mind leaving the bedroom door open when you&#39;re out, as we both do -=
- because the light through the windows is just so nice. Thanks for readi=
ng this! Looking forward to hearing from you.=20

(If you&#39;re curious, more about the place:)
Three bedroom, the only apartment on top floor of our building. High ceil=
ings, an 800 sq. ft open layout, a total of six windows face east and wes=
t.
* The kitchen is big, open and fully stocked. Dishwasher, jumbo fridge, p=
retty plates. Two tall windows look out over the treetops.
* There&#39;s a not-New-York-sized bathroom. Giant skylight, big tub, hap=
piness.
* The living room is furnished with a super comfy couch and chairs, stere=
o, shared work desk, and a nice tv. No cable, but fast internet.
* Right outside our apartment door. . . a little hatch takes you to the r=
oof. In spring, summer and fall, there&#39;s a grill, la fuma lounge chai=
rs, and a view of two bridges and the skyline to say hello to every night=
.

$1,400.00 Per Month, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, Bedroom + Workspace Available=
 Together
Available: Jan 01, 2015

Hi! I&#39;m looking for someone to take over half of a spacious apartment=
 in a great location for $1400. Move in date flexible around Jan. 1st.

The apartment takes up the 3rd floor of a walk-up and is split into a pri=
vate bedroom, a living room/large office, and a closet for each tenant. F=
ull bathroom with tub, separate sink room for convenience, and standard k=
itchen with new appliances, including a dishwasher. This will all be shar=
ed and will be on your side of the apartment. The rooms pictured are the =
ones for rent, with my furnishings which I will be moving to the other ha=
lf of the apartment.=20

Utilities run $60-100/month depending on the time of year; includes inter=
net, gas, electric. Landlord owns the restaurant downstairs so is readily=
 available. Dogs allowed on case-by-case basis.

Location:
10-15 min walk to B/Q/R at Dekalb or the C at Lafayette; 10 min walk to G=
 at Clinton-Washinton; B54 right out front, 2-3 blocks to B69 and B62.
Close to Manhattan Bridge by bike. My commute to the East Village takes 1=
5-20 min.
Across the street from Walgreen&#39;s and 24/7 food market, close to a st=
retch of restaurants and shops on Dekalb, 2-3 blocks away from laundromat=
, bike shop, Fort Greene Park, hardware store; very close to Pratt by bus=
 or bike, or a nice walk. All in all, very convenient location.

About Me: Late 20&#39;s female; I work in design and music. I enjoy spend=
ing time outside of the apartment, riding bikes, eating out, and prefer a=
n apartment that can be a respite from work and the rest of the city. Mos=
tly spend my time at home reading and drawing. My half of the apartment h=
as a private entrance from the hallway, so it&#39;ll be like having your =
own apartment most of the time.

About You: In your late 20&#39;s-30&#39;s, steadily employed or in school=
, clean, responsible, and considerate. Male or female (couples okay for a=
dditional $200 rent). Great situation for someone who needs a bit more cr=
eative/work space and enjoys a sense of privacy. Also, the rest of the ob=
vious stuff: no smoking indoors, no significant others who never leave, c=
leans their own mess, etc.=20

Showing from Thursday-Sunday, Dec. 18-21. If this sounds like a good fit,=
 email me a little about yourself, what you&#39;re looking for in a roomm=
ate and an apartment, and if you have any social media stuff, feel free t=
o send it over.=20

$1,000.00 Per Month, Bushwick, Brooklyn, 2 Awesome Roommates Needed for I=
ncredible Bushwick Apartment!
Available: Jan 15, 2015 through Jul 15, 2015

Hi there!
I&#39;ve been living happily in my beautiful Bushwick apartment with two =
wonderful roommates for over a year now, but sadly, the time has come for=
 us to part ways. As such, I&#39;m looking for two great new people to fi=
ll the other rooms... and the void in mine heart. As the current lease ex=
pires on the 15th of January, that will be move in day - although I *am* =
looking for at least one person to co-sign the lease extension (6 months)=
 with me asap. So why should you live in this awesome place? Well, I&#39;=
m glad you asked.

The apartment itself is unreal. It&#39;s on the third (and top) floor of =
the building, and as such, has very high ceilings - 15 feet or so. There&=
#39;s a ton of exposed brick, a ridiculously large living room, huge bedr=
ooms, skylights, lots of windows, a gigantic new kitchen with stainless s=
teel appliances (including a dishwasher!), two full bathrooms (seriously,=
 what 3-bedroom apartment has 2 full bathrooms???), wood floors, plenty o=
f storage space, and a roof with a 360 degree view of the city! Additiona=
lly, we&#39;re only a block from Maria Hernandez Park, and a 5 minute wal=
k from either the L or M train!

About the rooms themselves:=20
-Room #1 is huge; extremely high ceilings, exposed brick, and two full wi=
ndows (one with a view of the World Trade Tower). It&#39;s in the front o=
f the apartment, and is only $1050 a month.
-Room #2 is smaller, but still much larger than a normal NYC bedroom. It =
has extremely high ceilings, a skylight (in lieu of a window), and a ton =
of storage space for $900 a month.
-Both rooms have built-in AC/Heat units with remote controls, and built-i=
n armoires!

About me: I&#39;m a mid-twenties ESL teacher at a private school in the F=
inancial District; I love Monday night trivia at the local beer bar, read=
ing, petting dogs, playing guitar really, really poorly, the San Francisc=
o 49ers, and watching the occasional episode of Gilmore Girls. I keep the=
 apartment relatively clean, but not compulsively so, and I think there a=
re few things in the world better than a really good cup of coffee in the=
 morning. Perks for you - I love to bake bread and cookies in the winter,=
 and my homemade hummus is second to none!

About you: I&#39;m looking for someone around my age, preferably a profes=
sional or a student, (since I keep normal-ish hours and don&#39;t really =
party anymore). Aside that, just be kind, considerate, and responsible! I=
 think a home should be a safe and comfortable space for everyone, so com=
munication is key. We&#39;re all adults; we shouldn&#39;t have to argue o=
ver whose turn it is to buy paper towels and the like.=20

Anywho, as I said before, these rooms will be available on the 15th of Ja=
nuary, but I&#39;m looking for someone to co-sign with me asap (for a 6-m=
onth lease). If you&#39;re interested in taking a look at the place, feel=
 free to shoot me an email with a little bit about yourself and your avai=
lability!

addition to that we split the cost of common items, which we buy in bulk =
every few months (toilet paper, paper towels, dish detergent, etc).

The room is not furnished, and while we have a few pots and pans that can=
 be shared, we&#39;d prefer if you bring your own if you have them. =20

We are looking for someone who is friendly, clean, not too loud, and comf=
ortable around dogs.   =20

Room is available immediately; please contact me to arrange a meeting to =
view the room.  We can meet on weekdays after 7pm and weekends.

dows.  The apartment has exposed brick and dark hardwood floors throughou=

$1,100.00 Per Month, Brooklyn Waterfront Columbia/Degraw, Brooklyn, NY, H=
uge Sunny Bedroom in a cozy home with a cat
Available: Dec 15, 2014

Hello,
I am looking for a new roommate to move into and unfurnished room on Dece=
mber 15, 2014, or latest January 1, 2015. The room is quite spacious at 9=
 X 19, the apartment is on the third floor, with access to the roof. The =
view of the southern tip of Manhattan is stunning. One of the features of=
 this apartment is the bright sunlight, and the beautiful colors you can =
see from the windows and mini skylights. Located about 1 block from the d=
ocks of the Brooklyn Marine Terminal, this place has a unique nautical ch=
arm.
This is my fifth year in this house, and I adore the remote step away fro=
m all the gentrification of Court and Smith Streets. The Brooklyn Bridge =
Park, and the Governor&#39;s Island ferry are five blocks away.=20
Some people call this neighborhood Red Hook, or Columbia Heights, but it =
truly is the Brooklyn Waterfront. The F or G trains stop is an eleven min=
ute walk away. The B 61 Bus runs right down Columbia Street. There are so=
me small convenience stores close by, and the closest supermarket, Met fo=
od is four blocks away. There is also Union Market on Court Street. My fa=
vorite, is the Fairway Supermarket, all the way down Van Brunt Street, in=
 Red Hook. The laundromats are over on Union Street, with self serve or d=
rop off service.
The average utility cost is $60, this time of year, and about $80 in the =
Summer (if AC is needed) It is so open and breezy over here by the water,=
 so the summer is fairly mild. The landlord covers heat and hot water. It=
 is very quiet here at night.
I am a thirty-nine year old painter. My cat is nine. I kindly prefer that=
 she is the only pet in this house. I make visual displays in midtown dur=
ing the work week. I usually depart around eight, to come home around sev=
en. I rarely work on weekends.
I am a quiet person by nature. I like to watch movies in the living room =
sometimes, or cook a simple meal. I love my job, but it is physical, so I=
 like to recharge on the weeknights. I am an extremely chilled out person=
, and I enjoy keeping the place in order, especially in our shared spaces=
. In my opinion, this promotes optimism, and moving forward. I do not wan=
t to live with someone who is too busy to chip in on the cleaning. I am l=
ooking for someone who will speak up if any problems arise, and not sit i=
n passive silence. There is no cigarette smoking inside the apartment. Pl=
ease be prepared to fill out a brief rental application. I look forward t=
o meeting you, and giving you a tour of my home, which could be ours.

cal NYC room, about 150 sf, with great windows, hard wood floors, and bas=
eboard heat. Each room is $975.

The loft is located in the coolest community and best neighborhood for ev=
erything! Quick ride to Manhattan on L train, either Morgan Ave or Jeffer=
son stops. Shops at the Loom, hip restaurants, bars, music, and galleries=
 are all in walking distance. Bushwick is the NYC underground.

ughout, over 11 feet up. There is a double kitchen with new appliances, a=
 dishwasher, and aluminum counters. There are 2 large, full bathrooms wit=

and graduate students, mostly around mid-20s in age, with some older. All=
 people / all ages are welcome to live here. However, we have a no-cat po=
licy. There are no pets living here currently and pets in general are dis=
couraged, but not always. We are looking for an eager and compatible room=
mate for those already in the other rooms. The loft has a pleasant and li=
vely vibe. If you are a responsible, working, and open-minded person, you=
 will fit in here.

We are asking for a minimum 6 month commitment with first, last and depos=
it upfront, up to 1-yr lease. WiFi is free. Utilities, weekly cleaning se=
rvice, and common goods are extra, but are equally shared and reasonably =
priced (about $50/month total).=20

My partner and I are not the building landlords and are subleasing the lo=
ft out. However we act as your landlords, as well as the loft designers a=
nd caretakers who personally take care of everything. If you have a compl=
aint, we&#39;re on it. If you want custom shelving or a room loft (for a =
bed/storage), we can build it for you at a reasonable rate.

If this sounds like something you&#39;d like to be a part of, let us know=
 if you&#39;d like to come by for a viewing on Wednesday evening. Or we c=
an show the rooms at other times.

You&#39;d be sharing the apartment with a relaxed and clean 28-year-old f=

 and see friends out. We&#39;re both friendly and currently cook and shar=
e meals with our current roommate but also are all respectful of each oth=
er&#39;s space and privacy. There are two desks in the living room so who=
ever moves in could have a workspace either out there or in their room if=
 they were interested.

The apartment is conveniently located one block from the Clinton-Washingt=
on stop on the C train and 2 blocks from the Clinton-Washington stop on t=

on this deck to be a year round life-changer. Our home has ample space, l=
ight, and it&#39;s in charming neighborhood too!

I&#39;m a 30-yr old female who has loved living in this very special home=
- my two roommates and I have had a great time here, but all three of us =
are moving to new spots on Jan 1, so this is a very special opportunity t=
o take over my room and make this apartment what you want it to be with t=
wo other new roommates! We&#39;re getting lots of responses for the other=
 two rooms available and we&#39;re happy to pick two respectful/fun/kind/=

ing each other and we&#39;re hopeful this creative process can work for y=
ou too.

lock on Woodhull at Hicks St. It&#39;s a quick 9 minute walk from the Car=

$2,500.00, Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, Big Room in Big Apartment Available=
 for Sublet
Available: Dec 22, 2014 through Mar 16, 2015

I am looking for a subletter for my room in my apartment in Brooklyn. It =
is a roommate situation. It can be available as early as 12/22 until 3/16=
.=20

I am going to SF for the holidays and then doing a show in SF from Jan to=
 mid March. =20

The apartment is on the top floor of a two story house. There are 3 large=
 bedrooms. My room is big, has a couch, bed, 2 dressers, and 3 large wind=
ows facing the street. I have 2 really great roommates, Johanna who is fr=
om Columbia, she&#39;s 25 I think? She&#39;s sweet, funny and loves to co=
ok. She works at a school in Brooklyn in their accounting department. the=
n Santiago, he&#39;s 42, from Peru but grew up in Brooklyn, he is a mange=
r over at a wine shop in Manhattan. He&#39;s very cool, mellow, loves to =
play soccer and softball and watches lots of sports and also cooks. They =
are both very clean, we have a cleaning schedule where we trade off clean=
ing the common areas every 2 wks. It has worked well so far. The house is=
 usually pretty quiet as everyone is very busy and we all socialize outsi=
de the home.=20

There is one tiny room that will be used by my cousin when he comes in to=
wn (just FYI he probably won&#39;t come in town)- he&#39;s from Ireland a=
nd he is a cousin in law, he and my aunt and uncle own the house. The apa=
rtment has a large kitchen, small dining area, and a small living room fo=
r the common areas. We have cable with all channels, high speed internet =
and everyone just uses their mobile phone.

The neighborhood is very nice, quiet and safe. It is becoming more - dare=
 I say-  &quot;hip&quot; all the time. There are a few restaurants in wal=
king distance, as is a wine shop, a deli, and a new bar. It is Windsor Te=
rrace, Brooklyn, which is just south of Park Slope. You can walk to Park =
Slope in about 15 minutes. It is 1 block from the F/G line, B68 bus line,=
 Prospect Park and a laundromat. The Q is about 15-20min walk across the =
park. Everything is very convenient. It takes me about 30 min to get to w=
ork at W. 23rd and 6th Ave, about 40-45 to Times Square

I&#39;m looking for $2500 if you wanted to be there 12/22-3/16 or $2000 1=
/17-3/16. That would include all the utilities and everything. It would n=
eed to be paid upfront and I would draft up a sublease for you to sign.

Let me know if you&#39;re interested or anyone you know and trust might b=
e interested, thank you!
Cheers,
Mary

$1,150.00 Per Month, Columbia St. Waterfront District, Brooklyn, Winter o=
n the Waterfront in a Warm and Cozy Home
Available: Jan 01, 2015

Furnished room available in lovely 2 bedroom apartment in the Columbia Wa=
terfront neighborhood. Exposed brick, hardwood floors, great light, bedro=
oms face a beautiful view of Lower Manhattan. The room has a full-sized b=
ed, dresser, and wardrobe for hanging storage. $1,150 includes utilities =
and wifi. A $1,150 deposit is required. The landlord controls the heat, w=
hich there is plenty of, and hot water -- no tepid dribble showers going =
on here. Full-sized bathtub too. I&#39;m a woman in my late 30&#39;s with=
 a dog -- a 1.5 year old energetic and absurdly affectionate lab mix who =
already loves you to bits. If you love canine company, then she will be a=
 great companion. If dogs annoy you, she will drive you bananas. I have n=
o such simple equation for my human company, however -- that you&#39;ll j=
ust have to check out for yourself. I&#39;m an artist with a number of jo=
bs that keep working out of the house or in my studio for the time being,=
 though I am a homebody and work from home when I can. I like to be in my=
 pj&#39;s making soup and catching up on TAL or Radiolab whenever possibl=
e. That&#39;s the kind of wild lifestyle you&#39;d be in for if you lived=
 with me.

It&#39;s definitely a no smoking kind of place. My dog would probably lov=
e your cat but I&#39;m allergic. And the space isn&#39;t suitable for cou=
ples.

If you&#39;re looking in this neighborhood then you already know what a t=
errific place it is, and how hard it is to find anything here. Short or l=
onger term arrangements are ok. Let me know if you&#39;d like to come by.=

$1,600.00 Per Month, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 1 Private BR Sublet Availabl=
e in a 2 BR Spacious New Apt in the Heart of Williamsburg, same block as =
Bedford L train
Available: Jan 18, 2015 through Mar 22, 2015

This is for one private room of a 2 BR, 1 bath, spacious, and new apartme=
nt located in the heart of the vibrant artistic community of Williamsburg=
, Brooklyn. We&#39;re located on the same block as the Bedford L stop so =
it&#39;s extremely convenient for getting around -- you can get to Union =
Square in 5 minutes and we&#39;re only 1 stop away from Manhattan. I&#39;=
ll be in South America and Antarctica for 2 months from January 18 - Marc=
h 22, so those are the dates that the room is available. I&#39;m asking f=
or $3,200 for the duration of 1/18 - 3/22, which comes out to $1,600 a mo=
nth for 2 months. You would be potentially sharing the apartment with ano=
ther guest. I&#39;m also asking for a security deposit of $800.

The room contains a double bed. The place is bright and clean and in a gr=
eat area -- close enough to Bedford, Metropolitan, or Grand to enjoy all =
of the amazing bars, cafes, and restaurants, but just a touch off of the =
main drag to provide a semblance of peace. Also, if you like movies and/o=
r independent cinema, there are some great movie theaters within walking =
distance of our apartment. We are also 5 blocks from the waterfront, wher=
e you can experience some of the best views of the Manhattan skyline and =
also the Brooklyn Flea market and Smorgasburg food festival on the weeken=
ds.

Fresh linens and towels are provided, there is high speed internet and ca=
ble, central AC. Free coffee and tea are available upon request. In addit=
ion, I would be more than happy to provide information about the area or =
Manhattan or help out in whatever way we can.

There&#39;s ample desk and table space in case you want to hook up a lapt=
op and work for a while. Last but not least, our apartment building has a=
 rooftop!

If you need any recommendations, you can ask me and I&#39;ll do my best t=
o help you enjoy the city!

if you are a commuter, you can use it as your &quot;home away from home&q=
uot; for a comforting sleep when working in the city during the weeks. It=
 is available for both live and work options. For fewer days, the price i=
s negotiable. The apartment will not be available on the weekends, but Su=
nday night arrivals can be arranged if necessary.  If you need the space =
for more than two months, a security deposit is necessary.=20

The apartment is located near the Lincoln Road Q directly across from Pro=
spect Park. It is an easy 15 minute express trip to Manhattan.=20

I am flexible with what you might need. Feel free to ask questions!

$1,000.00 Per Month, ridgewood/bushwick, new york, 2 Rooms in Very Large =
Renovated Industrial Space in Ridgewood/Bushwick
Available: Dec 01, 2014 through Apr 30, 2015

We lease a very large space that used to be a button factory (living/dini=
ng room are 55x26x11) and We have 2 rooms available January 1st (sooner i=
f needed).

10x9x11 lofted room with big window and bed included if needed, and a 11x=
12x11 lofted with 2 big windows. There&#39;s lots of furniture to choose =
from as well!

The communal space is bright during the day with 4 windows and a skylight=
. It&#39;s an event space, so you could have an art opening, teach a clas=
s, have a performance art show, movie screening, photography/film shoot, =
etc. We are currently under construction downstairs building a recording =
studio, and would ideally like to get some musician/ film types in there,=
 but at the end of the day, I&#39;d really just like roommates that I don=
&#39;t have to clean up after! :) Also, looking for someone who will stay=
 4 months in the larger room, and around that long in the smaller room (w=
e are flexible).

One thing to note: The massive space does not get comfortably warm in the=
 harsh winter months. We have only 2 radiators in the communal area. It&#=
39;s bearable but chilly, so you will have to be okay with wearing layers=
. The bedrooms each have a radiator and we&#39;ll provide a supplemental =
electric heater if need be, but they stay comfortably warm throughout Win=
ter.

We are technically one block into Ridgewood, but hip shops in a proper bu=
shwick neighborhood are only a 7 block walk away just off the jefferson s=
top. We&#39;re a 3 block walk from the L train stop Dekalb stop-- Post of=
fice, shops, supermarket, dollar stores, beer distributors, &amp; laundro=
mats are all within short walking distance! The M train is a short 9 bloc=
ks away as well as the B38 bus around the corner takes you to downtown Br=
ooklyn in 20 mins! If you have a bicycle, we have plenty of space for you=
 to park it inside.

About us!

Roommate #1 &amp; #2 (couple) live downstairs and are constructing the st=
udio. We both work in film (in the field mixing and booming, in the studi=
o post-production) and we play in our duo band (whatpreytell.bandcamp.com=
) We&#39;re young at 26 &amp; 29, ambitious, drink sometimes, smoke somet=
imes, and like to throw a show out of the event space in the winter time.=
 We practice about twice to 5 times a month and only during the day time =
hours so it doesn&#39;t disturb anyone&#39;s slumber. We are fun, easy-go=
ing and very busy!

roommate #3 is a film &amp; sound guy. He works a lot, but you&#39;ll see=
 him in the afternoons. He&#39;s a cheeky sort of chap, a little older (s=
omething like 35) but young at heart. Very fun to be around when he&#39;s=
 had a few. Loves to play chess. He&#39;s renting his room out for the 4 =
months he&#39;ll be in china.

Roommate #4 &amp; #5 are a friendly couple. She&#39;s a bartender/waitres=
s who likes to hoola hoop and he manages the seafood station at whole foo=
ds. They have the front room so some nights are requested to be a little =
more quiet so they can sleep.

Roommate #6 works a lot but is very knowledgeable in technology and compu=
ters. He&#39;s also a dj by night. Fun great awesome guy.

Roommate#7 works 2 jobs and goes to school so we never see her, but she i=
s sweet and makes awesome fish soup.

3 bathrooms - Couple #2 have one private. The lot of us are busy/gone mos=
t of the time with the exception of the evening when everyone seems to ge=
t home from work, but the house is very quiet during the day.

We all love to play vinyls. Sometimes we put a movie on the projector at =
night. We all do our part to keep the communal spaces neat and clean. Bug=
s and rodents are a non-issue. We smoke our cigs outside. The vibe here i=
s free &amp; chill, and we hope to maintain that. It isn&#39;t a party ho=
use by any stretch- it is a home, but we have our friends over sometimes =
and it can get a little loud. We all try our best to be respectful and co=
mmunicative about our needs. All I really mean is, if the record is playi=
ng too loudly or voices are up, just say so.=20
Please No furry pets. unfortunately 2 of us are allergic, But we have a p=
air of old bearded dragons we keep around.


First months, last months rent and deposit are required to move in. That&=
#39;s $3,000 all day. A great deal for someone who has an appreciation an=
d use for so much communal event space. Again, the room can be furnished =
with furniture and anything else you might need. Just ask! The rent does =
not include utilities, which runs about $70-$90 per person.

Ask anything and please put &quot;&#39;Your name&#39; in Space!&quot; in =
the subject line when replying! Thanks!

$2,400.00 Per Month, West Village, New York, Charming village studio for =
one
Available: Jan 07, 2015 through Mar 15, 2015

My efficient and comfortable studio has a true city feeling. It is centra=
lly located on a quiet street, just three blocks from the Hudson River Pa=
rk.=20

The one room apartment is available for weekly or monthly rental from Jan=
 - March. It is cozy, quiet, and very clean and faces the back of the bui=
lding and shared garden space. The apartment is a nice oasis with a high =
speed internet connection, air conditioner, fresh linens, and good mini s=
peakers. Sorry, no tv, but lots of books. The sofa is also the single bed=
 so it is only suitable for 1 person. No couples please. Mature, discreet=
 guest preferred.

Also, please note there is currently repair work to the outside of my bui=
lding and it may not be peaceful during weekdays if you are home. I want =
to be upfront about the 4 workers who are generally present in and around=
 the building from 9-4:30 Mon - Fri. I can honestly say the noise level i=
sn&#39;t terrible, but it is a presence. When they leave, however, it&#39=
;s very very quiet. I&#39;m not sure how much work will be done during th=
e winter months.

The neighborhood is quaint with lots of cafes and boutique shopping and t=
ree-lined streets and it&#39;s a short walk to the Hudson River parks whe=
re you can walk or run, play tennis, play mini golf, skateboard, bike or =
lounge. Location is close to most subway lines. (A, C, E, D, B, F, L, M, =
1, 2, 3)

 with beautiful morning light and access to the roof for sunsets. I have =
a small working studio if that can be useful to you. I also have a new be=
d and a long claw foot tub; perfect for hot soaks! My place likes to stay=
 tidy and would be best for one who is particular in that way- it&#39;s a=
 bit Japanese in arrangement.=20
This is not a condo, it&#39;s very much like a hideaway tree house.
We have a super grocery next to the park, Archies pizza- open til 4am, co=
ffee-bars, Miles, Tandem, and King Noodle!! all within a few blocks.=20
Close to the M at Central, the J at Myrtle, and the L at Morgan

$1,000.00 Per Month, Ridgewood, Queens, Room and workspace for sublet in =
a spacious, beautiful apartment
Available: Dec 22, 2014 through Feb 08, 2015

Seasons Greetings, dear listers!

We (my partner and I) are travelling for a spell, and are sub-letting our=
 large and beautiful bedroom in Ridgewood, Queens from the last week of D=
ecember through the first week of February.  The room is in a three bedro=
om apartment, one room of which is occupied by our roommate, a print/vide=
o-maker in her mid-20&#39;s, and the other of which is a studio/workspace=
 which you would have free use of. The apartment has a (really) large liv=
ing room with bay windows and a large kitchen that looks out onto a small=
 garden. We are on a one block street that opens out onto a park and a sm=
all Jewish cemetery. We also have two skylights! One in the hall, and ano=
ther in the bathroom.=20

The block is quiet, and there is good parking should you have a car. It i=
s a bit of a hike to the train (10+ minutes to each), but the walk is nic=
e in both directions. Ridgewood is also a fun neighborhood - its mostly r=
esidential, but there are good grocery stores, strange little thrift shop=
s, several impressive churches(!), and some good balkan bars.=20

We have spent a lot of time and effort on the apartment and hope that you=
&#39;d treat it like a home as well (You&#39;d have to water some plants,=
 for example. Otherwise, nothing much). Finally, we are open to a partial=
 sublet and pro-rating that amount. If you have questions or would like a=
ny other pictures, please don&#39;t hesitate! Thanks for reading.=20

Regards,

Noah and Mollie

We&#39;re looking for someone to stay the full six weeks, if possible. Bu=

he total for the 6 six weeks would be $3,000. Its $2,000 for 1 month, and=
 $1,000 for 2 weeks.

Our rent is normally $23,000, but weve brought the price down to consider=
 cat-lovers for a discount. We have 2 super sweet, low-maintenance kittie=

mpared to the main part of Williamsburg, and still has that residential, =
Italian neighborhoody feel.

$1,000.00 Per Month, Midtown to downtown NYC, New York City, Female young=

 Hello, my name is Nicole and I am currently searching for an apartment i=
n Manhattan. I am in my mid-20s and work in real estate. I don&#39;t work=
 a 9-5 so I work both at home and at my office. I am looking either to re=
nt a room in an apartment or to meet other young professionals to rent an=
 apartment with. I am looking for a January 1st move-in, so would also be=
 okay with finding a temporary spot for a few months if this would make t=
hings easier.=20

I am hoping to stay in Manhattan, somewhere below 59th Street all the way=
 downtown to the Financial District. I have two cats (brothers, short hai=
r domestic breed) who are very loving, so pet-friendly is essential. I am=
 hoping not to spend more than $1000 per month but could spend up to $125=
0 for the right apartment.=20

I grew up in Los Angeles and lived in Europe for six years. I enjoy going=
 out to restaurants/bars in the city with friends just as much as I do a =
night at home watching TV. Looking for: easy-going, friendly roommates wh=
o also keep shared common spaces clean, respect each other&#39;s privacy,=
 like animals, work hard and are just all-around nice people. I hope to h=
ear from my future roommate(s) soon! Thank you!

Kreuzberg, Berlin, Germany, 800 sq. ft., New Yorkers  are you looking for=
 a Flat Swap with Berlin?
Available: Mar 01, 2015 through May 23, 2015

Hi,=20
We are two Photographers living in Berlin, and wed love to do a Flat Swap=
 with New York, preferably Brooklyn. If you think you could be a good fit=
, wed love to hear from you!=20
We live in Kreuzberg SO36, in one of the nicest neighborhoods in Berlin. =
Our bit of the street is very quiet, but numerous galleries, cafes, books=
tores and shops are all very close by. Markthalle 9, a 19th century cover=
ed market recently revived (a true food-lovers heaven!) is a three minute=
s walk, and some of Berlins most renowned nightlife attractions are also =
within walking distance (Berghain, Watergate, Tresor...) There are also n=
umerous parks around, one right next door next to a church.=20
You can see a bit of the neighborhood in the photos, they were all taken =
within 5 minutes walking distance from our home. Kreuzberg is still a rel=
atively mixed neighborhood, with a big Turkish population, many artists a=
nd students, but rents have been going up steadily over the last five or =
six years.=20
Our flat is about 800 square foot, has two large rooms (living room and w=
ork room), one smaller bedroom, a bathroom, kitchen, and small balcony (b=
ig enough to have breakfast on). It has original parquet floors, and stuc=
co in the bedroom. Except for the bathroom, the flat has not been fully r=
enovated for at least thirty years, which gives it some of its original c=
harm, but you have to be prepared for it... :)=20
The kitchen is very well-equipped, since we love to cook, and there is a =
beamer installed in the living room.=20
We are a both in our early 30s, were married recently, and have called th=
is place our home for eight years now.
We are looking for a comparable place in New York, if possible Brooklyn, =
and a nice person (or persons) to swap with. The best time for us to do s=
o would be between March and May 2015, from eight to twelve weeks.=20
If you&#39;re interested, please get in touch!=20

Nyc pet care over the holidays!, $25.00 per pet, NYC anywhere, Brooklyn &=
amp; Manhattan =3D easiest for me but let's discuss regardless, New York,=
 NY, I'm in town over the holidays and can feed your pets that are stayin=
g behind while you travel!
Available: Dec 16, 2014 through Jan 31, 2015

Life-long cat person who also adores dogs and other small animals.  NY&#3=
9;er for 17 years.  For the first time ever, I&#39;m in town over the hol=
idays and a big problem for me this time of year is usually finding someo=
ne to care for my two cats...  Since I&#39;m in town this year, I&#39;m o=
ffering to take care of this for you!  If we talk and it seems like a goo=
d fit, I&#39;m an easily verifiable professional person in the music indu=
stry, and I can give you countless references as well if you&#39;d like. =
 Also I&#39;ve used listings project many times in the past for housing. =
 :)

Boroughs/neighborhoods --- Williamsburg Bklyn is easiest for me, $25 per =
pet per day seems fair for house calls --- though let me know what feedin=
g &amp; cleaning schedule your pets usually keep and we&#39;ll work out a=
 plan specific to your needs financially &amp; living-creature-wise.  For=
 cats I&#39;m comfortable feeding and and leaving out fresh water, we cou=
ld discuss twice a day if that&#39;s your normal.  I&#39;m fine to clean =
out their litter boxes as well.  For dogs, let me know what you need &amp=
; if I can accommodate, I will.  For rabbits, hampsters, ferrets, birds, =
fish, whatever, just get in touch with what you need &amp; we&#39;ll sort=
 it.  The less time needed, the cheaper it can be!

I am willing to give basic medicines, though would be less likely to agre=
e to pet-sit if your pet were very seriously injured or sick. =20

And I&#39;m happy to hang out with them a bit each time I visit, provide =
them a friendly face, a good attitude &amp; some play time.  If not neede=
d, that&#39;s fine too.

Happy to travel beyond Williamsburg to whatever neighborhood &amp; boroug=
h if it makes sense financially, so just get in touch &amp; let me know w=
here you are/what you need &amp; we&#39;ll go from there.  Cheers!

udio/office I use for body-work, i.e. massage, etc. that I would like to =
share/offer to another healing practitioner. <br>
It&#39;s on Broome just below Bowery so it&#39;s convenient to the JM/ NR=
Q/ BD/ and 6 trains. <br>
My space is up a flight of easy, wide stairs on a floor with 4 other arti=
sts. <br>
The space has new walls, a new wood floor, a silver-leaf door, and a beau=
tiful skylight! It&#39;s serene. <br>
The room is about 150sq. ft. so there&#39;s ample room for a small group =
(2-3), like for Pilates or Yoga. <br>
I have a small seating area, yoga mats, a desk, file cabinet, an Ikea cre=
denza for sheets, and my bodywork table. <br>
Otherwise, it has a bohemian atmosphere very different than a healing cen=
ter/office type one. It&#39;s so refreshing having a whole studio to your=
self for this kind of work. Outside my space it&#39;s NOT pristine, like =
I say, it is an artists building, but it&#39;s cool. There is no waiting =
room. The bathroom isn&#39;t super fancy either, but it&#39;s quite new a=
nd very clean. My clients love the space and find it a comfortable settin=
g for receiving bodywork. I don&#39;t play music, but you could if you wa=
nt. <br>
The neighborhood is hip and lively and there are a variety of cafes and e=
ateries close by. <br>
The space would be ideal for Feldenkrais, Rolfing, Alexander technique, M=
assage, private yoga, Reflexology, Acupuncture, etc. <br>

e end of this month and we need to find a new lady to take her place / fi=
nish out her lease. We are looking for someone to move in at the beginnin=
g of January (room will be available the last week of December, so moving=
 in early is an option and encouraged) and stay, at least, through Septem=
ber. Our lease begins anew on October 1st of next year, and you will have=
 the option of sticking around and adding your name to it then. Only gals=
 need apply.</p><p>We live on the border of Prospect Heights and Clinton =
Hill in a spacious,=20
renovated apartment. The neighborhood, if you&#39;re unfamiliar with it, =
is a dream. More bars and restaurants than you could ever visit in a life=
time of living here. Ample Hills, which has got the greatest ice cream in=
 the universe. Chuko Ramen, Hot Bird, Little Brother BBQ, Gen Sushi, etc.=
 etc. etc. Prospect Park is just a few-minute walk, as is the Grand Army =
Plaza Farmer&#39;s Market, the Brooklyn Public Library, Brooklyn Museum, =
and, well, all sorts of other stuff.</p><p>The place is about a block and=
 a half from the C train, which&#39;ll take you right into the city. The =
G train is a 10-minute walk (or you can just transfer to the G, easily, a=
t Hoyt-Schermerhorn). We&#39;ve got a nice big living room (with A/C in t=
he warm months), a fully loaded kitchen, an eating area with table and tw=
o bathrooms. I redecorated a few months back, and the place is full of mi=
d-century furniture and=20
has got something of an autumnal vibe. We&#39;ve got an impressive record=
 and book collection, and some cheery plants.=20
</p><p>The room for rent is the largest of the three and it has its own b=
athroom (toilet, no shower; we share the main shower). It can fit a queen=
-sized bed, a dresser and an armoire. It&#39;s got a closet, too. All of =
the furniture in the room is for sale, so if you&#39;re in the market, pl=
ease mention that in your response to the ad. Cost is $1150/month + utili=
ties/Internet, which never come out to more than an additional $55/month.=
 The landlord requires a security deposit as well, in the amount of one m=
onth&#39;s rent. There are only two apartments in the building: this one =
and the one upstairs, which houses a trio of really nice, friendly dudes.=
 There is laundry (!!) in the basement. The room and the apartment itself=
 have large windows and are filled with light.</p><p>We are two women in =

Our roommate is headed abroad, so the nicest bedroom in our 3br apartment=
 is suddenly available. We&#39;re two easy going girls who keep a clean h=
ome and take things pretty easy. Could you tell us a little about somethi=
ng you love, or something you do, and a little bit about your schedule at=
 home?</p><p>Helpful stuff: <br>
* 1 bedroom available for month-to-month lease in South Williamsburg, ren=
t $1200 + utilities. Available January 15th. <br>
* 1st month and security to move in. Amazing transportation, food etc, al=
l within a few minutes walk. We smoke outside the apartment, but never in=
side. <br>
* The living room and kitchen are fully furnished with everything you nee=
d. <br>
* There is a construction site one block down, but it doesn&#39;t bother =
us really. This is New York after all. We are on the top floor, and the s=
ounds are all the mild sort: horns and rumbles, no earth shaking stuff. N=
ever at night, only when we&#39;re up for work anyway, it just hasn&#39;t=
 been an issue for any of us. <br>
* There&#39;s a cat. She&#39;s great.</p><p>The Room: <br>
* Has a fireplace, 13-foot ceilings, and striking gold afternoon and even=
ing light. We&#39;re one block from the river. <br>
* Also a tall window, a built in closet, a pretty Noguchi lamp on a dimme=
r, exposed brick (the nice kind), and room for a full or queen bed and on=
e or two small pieces of furniture.</p><p>About us: <br>
One of us is a film colorist from Switzerland, the other works with fabri=
cs and hails from France. When we&#39;re not working, we like to cook din=
ner, watch a film, or stumble around the neighborhood for drinks and good=
 times. If we&#39;re honest, we&#39;d like to find someone who doesn&#39;=
t mind leaving the bedroom door open when you&#39;re out, as we both do -=
- because the light through the windows is just so nice. Thanks for readi=
ng this! Looking forward to hearing from you. </p><p>(If you&#39;re curio=
us, more about the place:) <br>
Three bedroom, the only apartment on top floor of our building. High ceil=
ings, an 800 sq. ft open layout, a total of six windows face east and wes=
t. <br>
* The kitchen is big, open and fully stocked. Dishwasher, jumbo fridge, p=
retty plates. Two tall windows look out over the treetops. <br>
* There&#39;s a not-New-York-sized bathroom. Giant skylight, big tub, hap=
piness. <br>
* The living room is furnished with a super comfy couch and chairs, stere=
o, shared work desk, and a nice tv. No cable, but fast internet. <br>
* Right outside our apartment door. . . a little hatch takes you to the r=
oof. In spring, summer and fall, there&#39;s a grill, la fuma lounge chai=

/p><p>Hi there! <br>
I&#39;ve been living happily in my beautiful Bushwick apartment with two =
wonderful roommates for over a year now, but sadly, the time has come for=
 us to part ways. As such, I&#39;m looking for two great new people to fi=
ll the other rooms... and the void in mine heart. As the current lease ex=
pires on the 15th of January, that will be move in day - although I *am* =
looking for at least one person to co-sign the lease extension (6 months)=
 with me asap. So why should you live in this awesome place? Well, I&#39;=
m glad you asked.</p><p>The apartment itself is unreal. It&#39;s on the t=
hird (and top) floor of the building, and as such, has very high ceilings=
 - 15 feet or so. There&#39;s a ton of exposed brick, a ridiculously larg=
e living room, huge bedrooms, skylights, lots of windows, a gigantic new =
kitchen with stainless steel appliances (including a dishwasher!), two fu=
ll bathrooms=20
(seriously, what 3-bedroom apartment has 2 full bathrooms???), wood floor=
s, plenty of storage space, and a roof with a 360 degree view of the city=
! Additionally, we&#39;re only a block from Maria Hernandez Park, and a 5=
 minute walk from either the L or M train!</p><p>About the rooms themselv=
es: <br>
-Room #1 is huge; extremely high ceilings, exposed brick, and two full wi=
ndows (one with a view of the World Trade Tower). It&#39;s in the front o=
f the apartment, and is only $1050 a month. <br>
-Room #2 is smaller, but still much larger than a normal NYC bedroom. It =
has extremely high ceilings, a skylight (in lieu of a window), and a ton =
of storage space for $900 a month. <br>
-Both rooms have built-in AC/Heat units with remote controls, and built-i=
n armoires!</p><p>About me: I&#39;m a mid-twenties ESL teacher at a priva=
te school in the Financial District; I love Monday night trivia at the lo=
cal beer bar, reading, petting dogs, playing guitar really, really poorly=
, the San Francisco 49ers, and watching the occasional episode of Gilmore=
 Girls. I keep the apartment relatively clean, but not compulsively so, a=
nd I think there are few things in the world better than a really good cu=
p of coffee in the morning. Perks for you - I love to bake bread and cook=
ies in the winter, and my homemade hummus is second to none!</p><p>About =
you: I&#39;m looking for someone around my age, preferably a professional=
 or a student, (since I keep normal-ish hours and don&#39;t really party =
anymore). Aside that, just be kind, considerate, and responsible! I think=
 a home should be a=20
safe and comfortable space for everyone, so communication is key. We&#39;=

, Brooklyn, NY, Huge Sunny Bedroom in a cozy home with a cat</p><p>Availa=
ble: Dec 15, 2014</p><p>Hello, <br>
I am looking for a new roommate to move into and unfurnished room on Dece=
mber 15, 2014, or latest January 1, 2015. The room is quite spacious at 9=
 X 19, the apartment is on the third floor, with access to the roof. The =
view of the southern tip of Manhattan is stunning. One of the features of=
 this apartment is the bright sunlight, and the beautiful colors you can =
see from the windows and mini skylights. Located about 1 block from the d=
ocks of the Brooklyn Marine Terminal, this place has a unique nautical ch=
arm. <br>
This is my fifth year in this house, and I adore the remote step away fro=
m all the gentrification of Court and Smith Streets. The Brooklyn Bridge =
Park, and the Governor&#39;s Island ferry are five blocks away. <br>
Some people call this neighborhood Red Hook, or Columbia Heights, but it =
truly is the Brooklyn Waterfront. The F or G trains stop is an eleven min=
ute walk away. The B 61 Bus runs right down Columbia Street. There are so=
me small convenience stores close by, and the closest supermarket, Met fo=
od is four blocks away. There is also Union Market on Court Street. My fa=
vorite, is the Fairway Supermarket, all the way down Van Brunt Street, in=
 Red Hook. The laundromats are over on Union Street, with self serve or d=
rop off service. <br>
The average utility cost is $60, this time of year, and about $80 in the =
Summer (if AC is needed) It is so open and breezy over here by the water,=
 so the summer is fairly mild. The landlord covers heat and hot water. It=
 is very quiet here at night. <br>
I am a thirty-nine year old painter. My cat is nine. I kindly prefer that=
 she is the only pet in this house. I make visual displays in midtown dur=
ing the work week. I usually depart around eight, to come home around sev=
en. I rarely work on weekends. <br>
I am a quiet person by nature. I like to watch movies in the living room =
sometimes, or cook a simple meal. I love my job, but it is physical, so I=
 like to recharge on the weeknights. I am an extremely chilled out person=
, and I enjoy keeping the place in order, especially in our shared spaces=
. In my opinion, this promotes optimism, and moving forward. I do not wan=
t to live with someone who is too busy to chip in on the cleaning. I am l=
ooking for someone who will speak up if any problems arise, and not sit i=
n passive silence. There is no cigarette smoking inside the apartment. Pl=
ease be prepared to fill out a brief rental application. I look forward t=
o meeting you, and giving you a tour of my home, which could be ours. <br=

are discouraged, but not always. We are looking for an eager and compatib=

on, you will fit in here.</p><p>We are asking for a minimum 6 month commi=

a complaint, we&#39;re on it. If you want custom shelving or a room loft =
(for a bed/storage), we can build it for you at a reasonable rate.</p><p>=

ough Mar 16, 2015</p><p>I am looking for a subletter for my room in my ap=
artment in Brooklyn. It is a roommate situation. It can be available as e=
arly as 12/22 until 3/16. </p><p>I am going to SF for the holidays and th=
en doing a show in SF from Jan to mid March.=20
</p><p>The apartment is on the top floor of a two story house. There are =
3 large bedrooms. My room is big, has a couch, bed, 2 dressers, and 3 lar=
ge windows facing the street. I have 2 really great roommates, Johanna wh=
o is from Columbia, she&#39;s 25 I think? She&#39;s sweet, funny and love=
s to cook. She works at a school in Brooklyn in their accounting departme=
nt. then Santiago, he&#39;s 42, from Peru but grew up in Brooklyn, he is =
a manger over at a wine shop in Manhattan. He&#39;s very cool, mellow, lo=
ves to play soccer and softball and watches lots of sports and also cooks=
. They are both very clean, we have a cleaning schedule where we trade of=
f cleaning the common areas every 2 wks. It has worked well so far. The h=
ouse is usually pretty quiet as everyone is very busy and we all socializ=
e outside the home.=20
</p><p>There is one tiny room that will be used by my cousin when he come=
s in town (just FYI he probably won&#39;t come in town)- he&#39;s from Ir=
eland and he is a cousin in law, he and my aunt and uncle own the house. =
The apartment has a large kitchen, small dining area, and a small living =
room for the common areas. We have cable with all channels, high speed in=
ternet and everyone just uses their mobile phone.</p><p>The neighborhood =
is very nice, quiet and safe. It is becoming more - dare I say- &quot;hip=
&quot; all the time. There are a few restaurants in walking distance, as =
is a wine shop, a deli, and a new bar. It is Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, w=
hich is just south of Park Slope. You can walk to Park Slope in about 15 =
minutes. It is 1 block from the F/G line, B68 bus line, Prospect Park and=
 a laundromat. The Q is about 15-20min walk across the park. Everything i=
s very convenient. It=20
takes me about 30 min to get to work at W. 23rd and 6th Ave, about 40-45 =
to Times Square</p><p>I&#39;m looking for $2500 if you wanted to be there=
 12/22-3/16 or $2000 1/17-3/16. That would include all the utilities and =
everything. It would need to be paid upfront and I would draft up a suble=
ase for you to sign.</p><p>Let me know if you&#39;re interested or anyone=
 you know and trust might be interested, thank you! <br>

 bit Japanese in arrangement. <br>
This is not a condo, it&#39;s very much like a hideaway tree house. <br>

pell, and are sub-letting our large and beautiful bedroom in Ridgewood, Q=
ueens from the last week of December through the first week of February. =
The room is in a three bedroom apartment, one room of which is occupied b=
y our roommate, a print/video-maker in her mid-20&#39;s, and the other of=
 which is a studio/workspace which you would have free use of. The apartm=
ent has a (really) large=20
living room with bay windows and a large kitchen that looks out onto a sm=
all garden. We are on a one block street that opens out onto a park and a=
 small Jewish cemetery. We also have two skylights! One in the hall, and =
another in the bathroom. </p><p>The block is quiet, and there is good par=
king should you have a car. It is a bit of a hike to the train (10+ minut=
es to each), but the walk is nice in both directions. Ridgewood is also a=
 fun neighborhood - its mostly residential, but there are good grocery st=
ores, strange little thrift shops, several impressive churches(!), and so=
me good balkan bars.=20
</p><p>We have spent a lot of time and effort on the apartment and hope t=
hat you&#39;d treat it like a home as well (You&#39;d have to water some =
plants, for example. Otherwise, nothing much). Finally, we are open to a =
partial sublet and pro-rating that amount. If you have questions or would=
 like any other pictures, please don&#39;t hesitate! Thanks for reading. =

 Berlin, Germany, 800, New Yorkers are you looking for a Flat Swap with B=
erlin?</p><p>Available: Mar 01, 2015 through May 23, 2015</p><p>Hi, <br>
We are two Photographers living in Berlin, and wed love to do a Flat Swap=
 with New York, preferably Brooklyn. If you think you could be a good fit=
, wed love to hear from you! <br>
We live in Kreuzberg SO36, in one of the nicest neighborhoods in Berlin. =
Our bit of the street is very quiet, but numerous galleries, cafes, books=
tores and shops are all very close by. Markthalle 9, a 19th century cover=
ed market recently revived (a true food-lovers heaven!) is a three minute=
s walk, and some of Berlins most renowned nightlife attractions are also =
within walking distance (Berghain, Watergate, Tresor...) There are also n=
umerous parks around, one right next door next to a church. <br>
You can see a bit of the neighborhood in the photos, they were all taken =
within 5 minutes walking distance from our home. Kreuzberg is still a rel=
atively mixed neighborhood, with a big Turkish population, many artists a=
nd students, but rents have been going up steadily over the last five or =
six years. <br>
Our flat is about 800 square foot, has two large rooms (living room and w=
ork room), one smaller bedroom, a bathroom, kitchen, and small balcony (b=
ig enough to have breakfast on). It has original parquet floors, and stuc=
co in the bedroom. Except for the bathroom, the flat has not been fully r=
enovated for at least thirty years, which gives it some of its original c=
harm, but you have to be prepared for it... :) <br>
The kitchen is very well-equipped, since we love to cook, and there is a =
beamer installed in the living room. <br>
We are a both in our early 30s, were married recently, and have called th=
is place our home for eight years now. <br>
We are looking for a comparable place in New York, if possible Brooklyn, =
and a nice person (or persons) to swap with. The best time for us to do s=
o would be between March and May 2015, from eight to twelve weeks. <br>
If you&#39;re interested, please get in touch! <br>

talk and it seems like a good fit, I&#39;m an easily verifiable professio=

sually keep and we&#39;ll work out a plan specific to your needs financia=
lly &amp; living-creature-wise. For cats I&#39;m comfortable feeding and =
and leaving out fresh water, we could discuss twice a day if that&#39;s y=
our normal. I&#39;m fine to clean out their litter boxes as well. For dog=
s, let me know what you need &amp; if I can accommodate, I will. For rabb=
its, hampsters, ferrets, birds, fish, whatever, just get in touch with wh=
at you need &amp;=20
we&#39;ll sort it. The less time needed, the cheaper it can be!</p><p>I a=

39;m happy to hang out with them a bit each time I visit, provide them a =
friendly face, a good attitude &amp; some play time. If not needed, that&=

ghborhood &amp; borough if it makes sense financially, so just get in tou=
