$850 per month, Greenpoint, 750 square feet, The office space for rent  is =

Available: February 20, 2013
The office space for rent is located in 67 West Street, a converted  factor=
y now
 occupied by artists and entrepreneurs of many stripes in a  seven-story ve=
ry secure
building (key card access and security guards).  Three blocks from the G tr=
ain at
Greenpoint Avenue, and two blocks from  the India Street stop on the East R=
iver=20
ferry, the office is situated in  the heart of Greenpoint - a vibrant and d=
eveloping
neighborhood full of  great cafes, restaurants, and small businesses.
Ovenly is a bakery and creative food company and we are looking to rent a  =
portion
of our beautiful 750 square foot office on the seventh floor of  this conve=
rted=20
factory. The space has a large window, high ceilings,  exposed brick, wood =
beams;
it is has an industrial feel with the  comforts of a modern workplace.
The office atmosphere is social but hard working. We conduct many  meetings=
 with
 clients and staff at a conference table, and do play music  on low through=
out the
day; if you're looking for a silent work  environment this may not be the b=
est fit.
The corner area we are looking to rent has room 2-4 people and storage.

The original house was built in 1849 on a 600-acre apple orchard. Old  floo=

 Today,
the house still feels like it is exactly  where a house should be.

$1,500 per month, Greenpoint, Light-Filled Room in Large, Beautiful 2BD -- =
W/D,=20
Dishwasher, Exposed Beams and Brick
Available: March 1
I just moved into a beautiful 2bd in Greenpoint and I'm looking for a fun, =
relaxed
and courteous roommate.
The apartment just went through a huge remodel, and the photos show a  few =
unfinished
bits that have since been completed. I'm aiming for a  move-in date of Marc=
h 1,=20
although I'm open to someone coming earlier.  The room is $1,500. I'm also =
willing
to negotiate couples for $1,700.
Important stuff first:
The apartment: It's the whole top floor of a three-story walkup. At  1,000 =
square
feet, it has a huge living room, which features a red brick  wall and expos=
ed ceiling
beams. (The ceiling's also high, although I'm  not sure exactly how high. 1=
5 feet?)
The living room gets nice light  from a skylight. The bedrooms are on oppos=
ite ends
of the apartment. The  available one is large (it's queen-sized), with a bi=
g closet
and two  tall windows with a view of the Chrysler Building. The separate ki=
tchen
  is completely remodeled, with brand-new appliances (including a  dishwash=
er!)=20
and marble counters. You can't see it well in the photos,  but there's also=
 a long
marble counter that runs against the opposite  wall. It's got a window that=
 opens
to a fire escape. The bathroom is  also totally remodeled, and it has subwa=
y tiles
and a skylight. Possibly  the best thing about this place is that there's a=
 washer
and dryer in  the unit. There are hardwood floors and original crown moldin=
g  throughout.
This is basically the quintessential Brooklyn apartment.
The place is fully furnished except for the open room, although I do  have =
an armoire
and nightstand you're welcome to use. Otherwise, I'll  get rid of them.
The neighborhood: Amazing. The place is on Calyer (a cozy little  tree-line=
d street),
right off Franklin, which I think may be the nicest  street in all of Green=
point/Williamsburg.
Lots of shops, restaurants and  caf=E9s with beautiful storefronts without =
the craze
of Bedford Ave.  McCarren Park is also a short, 5- to 7-minute walk. The Gr=
eenpoint
and  Nassau G stops are a few blocks away, but I usually just go to the  Be=
dford
 L because the walk is so pretty.
Me: I'm a 30-year-old journalist working on a master's degree at  Columbia =
in science
journalism. My program ends in May, but right now I  spent four days a week=
 on campus.
I have a large dog who's actually a  German Shepherd/Akita mix but looks li=
ke a=20
panda/raccoon hybrid and does  this thing called "the unicorn." Also, I wil=
l occasionally
bake you  things and more than occasionally ask if you want to have a game =
night.
I  literally just ordered "Apples to Apples" on Amazon. So there's that.
You: I'm open to anyone, including couples, but I prefer females. I'm  look=
ing for
a fun roommate who doesn't usually bring the party home.  Obviously, I'm al=
so looking
for someone responsible and courteous who  likes things clean. Big bonus fo=
r someone
who enjoys the idea of living  with a dog. (It's pretty great.)
Moving in: First month plus a one-month security deposit. Heat and hot  wat=
er are
included in the rent, and the rest of the utilities and  Internet are divid=
ed down
the middle.

$800 per month, Greenpoint, Cozy room in great neighborhood -
Available: March 1st, 2013 (flexible) through Open
I am looking for a roommate to share my cozy and sweet, though quite  small=
, apartment
in North Greenpoint - a neighborhood I absolutely  adore, and have lived in=
 since
I moved to NY 4 years ago.
The apartment is filled with light and plants and books, and feels like a  =
little
haven. It's box shaped with a narrow entrance hall, has two  private rooms,=
 a small
kitchen, a bathroom with shower (no bath), and a  small dining room with a =
kitchen
table. Both private rooms are about the  same size, have large windows that=
 let=20
in tons of light and great cross  currents in warmer weather, but all stay =
the perfect
warmth during the  winter. It's a 4th floor walk up in an old building with=
 lots
 of  character - friendly neighbors who I never hear but say hi to in the  =
stairway.
I currently live here alone, and work from home when I'm not travelling -  =
but I
 am getting a studio and will be working from there much of the  time. The =
pictures
are about a year old but show the place quite well,  and some of the stuff =
will=20
be moved to my studio so it won't have as  much of my work things. I'm actu=
ally=20
open to renting out either room and  moving stuff around to accommodate. Th=
e apt
 is furnished, so a sublet  set-up would be best as there isn't a ton of st=
orage
 space. Even though  it's small, I've had a number of fantastic roommates i=
n the
 past and  it's a really cozy place to share, especially if, like me, you w=
ork a
  lot and have a nice life outside the house.
The rent is $800 per month, and that includes all utilities (heat, WIFI,  e=
tc, but
not airconditioning... though if you want to put one in and  pay for it you=
're more
than welcome to). I'm pretty flexible with move  in date and length - but w=
ould=20
love to get someone in March to stay at  least a month or two, ideally long=
er. =20
If you're interested but not sure  about timing, get in touch anyway as may=
be we
 can work it out.
I am a documentary filmmaker and editor - I travel about a week a month  on=
 production,
and the rest of the time I work freelance, mainly  editing. I work a lot, b=
ut I=20
also love to unwind with a glass of wine at  a neighborhood bar, or a movie=
 or reading
at home. Like most people,  I'm both very social and need some shut off pri=
vate=20
time. I'm easy going  and considerate, have a tidy and clean but slightly c=
luttered
style,  and would like to find someone similar who will clean up after  the=
mselves
but not be anal.  I have small dinner parties at the house  sometimes, but =
mostly
it's a place I come to to relax and toodle around.   It's important to me t=
hat I
 roommate with someone who I can say hello  to in the morning and have a ni=
ce chat
every once in a while, but I'm  also happy to give you your space.
I really love this part of Greenpoint - it's both quiet and safe, a  little=
 off=20
the beaten track but not too much to be a hassle, and has  enough bars and =
restaurants
and plenty of cafes.  There are literally 3  of my favorite cafes within wa=
lking
 distance, great neighborhood bars as  well as two lovely wine bars, a grea=
t pizza
place, fab polish food, a  shnazzy cheese and wine place, one of the best n=
atural
grocery stores in  BK, etc, etc! There are a lot of artists in the neighbor=
hood,
 and it's  on the quieter side from Williamsburg and south Greenpoint and i=
t has
 a  great neighborhood vibe. We are right by the G train which links up wit=
h  the
L into Manhattan. We are also right by the 7 train and it takes 20  mins to=
 get=20
to Times Square.
Thanks!

$850 per month, Park Slope, 12 X 8 1/2, Sun drenched 12 X 8 1/2  room in co=
zy Park
Slope apt
Available: March 1 through whenever
Room is in the 2nd floor apartment of a two story house on 12th Street  nea=
r 7th
 Avenue, Park Slope. It is 12 X 8 =BD, has a window overlooking a  garden, =
is sun-filled
and very quiet. Rent is $850.00 per month, W-Fi  included. Utilities are $3=
0.00=20
per month.
The room is big enough for a queen size bed, dresser and chair..or a  twin =
bed which
would then allow room for a small desk as well. There is a  clothes closet =
with=20
a storage shelf in the private upstairs landing  which would be for the exc=
lusive
use of the roommate. There is also room  for storing a bicycle in an empty =
space
 adjoining the stairwell. The  room is being rented unfurnished, however I =
would
 consider providing  some furniture if necessary. Also I have a queen or tw=
in size
airbed  that I can provide temporarily, but it would not be a long term  so=
lution...these
beds tend to leak air after long term use.
The apartment itself is 600 sf and is newly renovated, with an all new  kit=
chen,
 bathroom, refinished hardwood floors, and beautiful new paint  job. It is =
two small
flights up from street level.
Although the apartment is a one bedroom, I am using it as a two bedroom  (t=
he "living
room" being the 2nd bedroom). The bedrooms are private,  with doors, and si=
tuated
on either side of the large kitchen which  includes a small common area wit=
h a table
and chairs. The entrance to  the apartment opens into the kitchen.
Re the Kitchen: It is dream for someone who likes to cook..brand new 5  bur=
ner range
and stove, giant new refrigerator, and new very spacious  cabinets. It is f=
ully=20
outfitted with kitchen stuff like dishes, pots,  pans, knives, forks, cups,=
 bowls,
blender, toaster, etc., and a  cappuccino machine.
The bathroom is shared and is situated one window away from the room for  r=
ent,=20
so is very convenient for a roommate. The bathroom has a window,  gets lots=
 of light,
and has a very large bathtub and shower.
The apartment is also home to two friendly cats which basically stay in  my=
 room
 unless invited out by the roommate. If you have a cat that you  would like=
 to bring
with you that is negotiable, although I would prefer  not having any more a=
nimals
in the apt.
Note:* The apartment and entire building is a No-Smoking environment. So  i=
f you
 smoke you would have to do it outside of the building.
Room is available starting March 1 which is when my current roommate is  mo=
ving=20
out to start living with her boyfriend. To move in you will need  first mon=
th's=20
rent in advance plus one month's rent as Security Deposit.
About me:
Photographer, male, 70's, work in the arts, hang out with artists and  acad=
emics.
Spend very little time at home, mostly working in my studio,  or out with f=
riends.
When I'm home I like the space to be a respite from  the somewhat hectic li=
fe I=20
lead outside of it, and would hope that a  roommate would have that same fe=
eling
 about their living space.
About you:
Somehow connected to the arts, able to pay the rent on time, reasonably  ne=
at, considerate
of others, done with your partying days, or if not, at  least not into brin=
ging=20
the party home.
It would be nice if we had enough in common so that when we pass each  othe=
r coming
in or out, or happen to be in the common space at the same  time, we might =
engage
in some interesting bits of conversation, but that  would be a plus, not a =
necessity.
The neighborhood is full of great restaurants, bars, cafes, shops of  every=
 description,
Park Slope Food Coop and other food stores, &  many laundromats, Zipcar gar=
age down
the street, F & B trains a  block away, and the R a five minute walk; Two b=
locks
 from the 5th Ave  bus line, =BD block from the 7th Ave bus lines, 4 blocks=
 to a YMCA
with a  great pool, and Yoga all over the place.

Available: March 1st through April 30th
Looking for a roommate to take over my room while I'm away for an art  resi=
dency
 in Iceland for March and April. Live in a fully furnished 1400  square foo=
t, four
bedroom open loft off the Bedford Avenue L train in  an art-filled fully fu=

4 blocks
away from the L train  (10 minutes to Union Square) and easy walking/biking=
 distance
to all  the great restaurants, bars, and shops the neighborhood has to offe=
r.  Having
lived here for the past 8 years I can attest to the amazing  location and c=
onvenience
of living in the neighborhood at this specific  apartment.
The remaining three roommates are hardworking, clean, friendly and  motivat=

year-olds, two girls and a guy: an environmental  scientist master chef, a =
9-5 finance
athlete, and a camera assistant for  tv, films, and commercials. We keep a =

conversation, if not a drink or dinner, to  catch up. We're definitely not =
crazy
 party people but we do occasionally  enjoy crazy parties, just not in our =
apartment.
If you think this seems like a good fit please respond to the post as  soon=
 as possible
to schedule a time to see the apartment. Ideally you  are an interesting pe=
rson=20
with a full-time responsibility (school and/or  job) and keep relatively no=
rmal=20
hours (no stay up all night vampires  please) who does not use hardcore dru=
gs (ever)
or smoke inside the  apartment. We discourage work-from-home hermit types a=
nd  bar/club/late-night
lifestyles compared to our own. It would be helpful  if you've lived in a l=
oft before
but not necessary, so long as you're  aware and respectful of others. The r=
oom is
only available for March and  April but we'd like to attract responsible-pl=
anning-ahead-types
so  please contact us as soon as possible.
All utilities are included in the $1300 per month rent (heat, water,  gas, =
electric,
cable, internet, everything). A one month security  deposit will be require=
d and
 ultimately used for your last month's stay  so long as you don't burn the =
apartment
down. So to move-in the total is  $2600 and you're good to go for both mont=
hs of
 your stay.
I'm allergic to cats so no-go for felines. We love dogs and dog-sit  sporad=
ically
but we're very hesitant to invite along a full-time 5th  roommate, especial=
ly if
 he/she drools, smells, and barks (this goes for  pets and significant othe=
rs, no
couples).

$1400 per month, Park Slope South, 300 sq. ft. +, Large live/work space in =
wonderful
neighborhood
Available: March 1
This space is available March 1.
I am renting a large space in a big apartment shared with three roommates.
The building is a converted factory and so the space has very high  ceiling=
s and
 old concrete floors with lots of light and an amazing view  of the harbor =
and lower
Manhattan. This has been a great  apartment/studio for me to live in and wo=
rk in
 with lots of good energy  and good neighbors. I am a working artist in my =
forties,
the other  roommates are a couple, two actors from Europe. We are quiet, fo=
cused
 on  our work. I rarely have a small group of friends over to drink wine,  =
eat and
talk but if you host an occassional party, that's fine.
There is roof access and gardening and bees there. Many good folks frequent=
 the=20
roof.
The building is in the Park Slope South/South Slope neighborhood which  is =
very=20
peaceful and laid back with a great selection of bars and  restaurants and =
grocery
stores and good train access.
Your space is private with its own door and a separate room inside. It's  a=
 wonderful,
quirky space. This is a large apartment formerly used by a  painter working=
 on massive
panels.
I have internet service and that is included.
Utilities are shared but these are usually remarkably low, especially for t=
he size
of the apartment.
The apartment also comes with an upright piano.
Rent is $1400 a month and I require one month security. I am open to  short=
-term
 leasing though I would prefer longer-term. What I would like  most is to f=
ind a
 good fit.
The R is two blocks away and the F and G are a short walk from here.

$2500 per month, Park Slope, 885 sq ft, Beautiful Family Friendly Apt. righ=
t by=20
Prospect Park
Available: June 1 2013 through Open
As an artist couple with a baby and a "strange" credit record, it was very =
hard=20
getting an apt. in this neighborhood.
Now that we are moving to Europe, we would love to pass it on to someone in=
 need
 of a child friendly home.
The apt is a spacious 2 bedroom with lots of light and wood flooring.  The =
rent=20
includes heating and there is a newly installed kitchen  including dishwash=
er. The
apt is a so-called butterfly shape - living  room, dining and kitchen in th=
e front,
bathroom in the middle, and 2  bedrooms (one large and one small) in the ba=
ck.
Or you could call it: Party in the front, baby in the back :)
The apt is on the 3rd floor (2nd floor in European terms) of a classic  Bro=
oklyn
 brownstone. Set on a tree-lined street right by Prospect Park  with all it=
s running
options, playgrounds and general niceness. Walk the  other way and you are =
surrounded
by bars, shops and restaurants.
Everyone in our building are super friendly and the same goes for the landl=
ord.
This is a great place to live. We hope to be able to pass it on to other gr=
eat people.
There is no broker fee (usually 15% of the annual rent) but we have made  i=
nvestments
of about $2,000 that we would like returned.
If anyone is interested, we will be leaving most of our furniture behind.

$1630 per month, Fort Greene, 400, Beautiful Fort Greene Walk-Up with Amazi=

of Manhattan/Brooklyn
Available: March 1 through June 1
I am looking to sublet my apartment ASAP - willing to start March 1st,  or =
discuss
mid-March/April as well, for a sublet to June 1st with an  option to take o=
ver the
lease (if you're interested).
It's a truly beautiful 4th floor walk-up in a gorgeous Fort Greene  neighbo=
rhood.
Fort Greene is one of the best areas in Brooklyn; it's a  historic district=
; you're
minutes from Fort Greene park; you're within a  10-minute walk to BAM, Barc=
lays=20
Center, Atlantic Center (Target, Best  Buy, etc). The bars and restaurants =
are fantastic,
as well.
The apartment can remain furnished until June, or can be unfurnished  when =
you move
in; whichever you prefer. I have a couch; large, beautiful  Restoration har=
dware
 desk; a dresser, queen-sized bed, and 55-in HDTV.  The bedroom has two lar=
ge closets
with storage room above, as well as a  hall closet. You have gorgeous views=
 of downtown
Brookyn and the  southern tip of Manhattan/Manhattan Bridge. You're also a =
top-floor
 apartment, so no noise from above.
The apartment is already equipped with internet if you'd like it, and  the =
television
streams Netflix in HD, etc. I also have a PS3 I'm willing  to leave, if you=
're interested.
More than anything, I'm looking for a responsible, clean, quiet tenant  (or=
 tenants
- it's great for a couple, and I occupied the apartment for a  year and a h=
alf with
my girlfriend) to take my place for a few months  or beyond. If you take th=
e sublet
you have first crack at the lease  (which will be raised to about $1,660 in=
 June).

ew fruit trees.<br /> <br /> You can walk out the front door, cross the 6-a=
cre field and access an  abandoned railroad track that connects to the Appa=
lachian Trail. This  part of the trail hugs the Basha Kill Wildlife Managem=
ent Area  (http://www.thebashakill.org/aboutbk.htm). Less than a mile down =
the  road is an organic vineyard  (http://www.bashakillvineyards.com/index2=
.htm) that is open every  Saturday and a small boat landing for non-motor b=
oats only.<br /> <br /> Wurtsboro: The town is 5 miles away and has a libra=
ry, post office,  veterinary hospital, wine shop, local art galleries, smal=
l health food  store, crystal healing center, ice cream stand, gas stations=
 and a few  stores and restaurants. It is a yellow ribbon town meaning that=
 is  dominantly Democrats. I also call it a pink bow town because several g=
ay  men and lesbians who grew up in the town work and own on main street.<b=

500 per month, Greenpoint, Light-Filled Room in Large, Beautiful 2BD -- W/D=
, Dishwasher, Exposed Beams and Brick<br /> Available: March 1<br /><br /> =
I just moved into a beautiful 2bd in Greenpoint and I'm looking for a fun, =
relaxed and courteous roommate.<br /> <br /> The apartment just went throug=
h a huge remodel, and the photos show a  few unfinished bits that have sinc=
e been completed. I'm aiming for a  move-in date of March 1, although I'm o=
pen to someone coming earlier.  The room is $1,500. I'm also willing to neg=
otiate couples for $1,700. <br /> <br /> Important stuff first:<br /> <br /=
> The apartment: It's the whole top floor of a three-story walkup. At  1,00=
0 square feet, it has a huge living room, which features a red brick  wall =
and exposed ceiling beams. (The ceiling's also high, although I'm  not sure=
 exactly how high. 15 feet?) The living room gets nice light  from a skylig=
ht. The bedrooms are on opposite ends of the apartment. The  available one =
is large (it's queen-sized), with a big closet and two  tall windows with a=
 view of the Chrysler Building. The separate kitchen  is completely remodel=
ed, with brand-new appliances (including a  dishwasher!) and marble counter=
s. You can't see it well in the photos,  but there's also a long marble cou=
nter that runs against the opposite  wall. It's got a window that opens to =
a fire escape. The bathroom is  also totally remodeled, and it has subway t=
iles and a skylight. Possibly  the best thing about this place is that ther=
e's a washer and dryer in  the unit. There are hardwood floors and original=
 crown molding  throughout. This is basically the quintessential Brooklyn a=
partment.<br /> <br /> The place is fully furnished except for the open roo=
m, although I do  have an armoire and nightstand you're welcome to use. Oth=
erwise, I'll  get rid of them.<br /> <br /> The neighborhood: Amazing. The =
place is on Calyer (a cozy little  tree-lined street), right off Franklin, =
which I think may be the nicest  street in all of Greenpoint/Williamsburg. =
Lots of shops, restaurants and  caf=E9s with beautiful storefronts without =
the craze of Bedford Ave.  McCarren Park is also a short, 5- to 7-minute wa=
lk. The Greenpoint and  Nassau G stops are a few blocks away, but I usually=
 just go to the  Bedford L because the walk is so pretty.<br /> <br /> Me: =
I'm a 30-year-old journalist working on a master's degree at  Columbia in s=
cience journalism. My program ends in May, but right now I  spent four days=
 a week on campus. I have a large dog who's actually a  German Shepherd/Aki=
ta mix but looks like a panda/raccoon hybrid and does  this thing called "t=
he unicorn." Also, I will occasionally bake you  things and more than occas=
ionally ask if you want to have a game night. I  literally just ordered "Ap=
ples to Apples" on Amazon. So there's that.<br /> <br /> You: I'm open to a=
nyone, including couples, but I prefer females. I'm  looking for a fun room=
mate who doesn't usually bring the party home.  Obviously, I'm also looking=
 for someone responsible and courteous who  likes things clean. Big bonus f=
or someone who enjoys the idea of living  with a dog. (It's pretty great.) =
<br /> <br /> Moving in: First month plus a one-month security deposit. Hea=
t and hot  water are included in the rent, and the rest of the utilities an=
d  Internet are divided down the middle.<br /><br /> <a style=3D"color: bla=

0 per month, Greenpoint, Cozy room in great neighborhood -<br /> Available:=
 March 1st, 2013 (flexible) through Open<br /><br /> I am looking for a roo=
mmate to share my cozy and sweet, though quite  small, apartment in North G=
reenpoint - a neighborhood I absolutely  adore, and have lived in since I m=
oved to NY 4 years ago.  <br /> <br /> The apartment is filled with light a=
nd plants and books, and feels like a  little haven. It's box shaped with a=
 narrow entrance hall, has two  private rooms, a small kitchen, a bathroom =
with shower (no bath), and a  small dining room with a kitchen table. Both =
private rooms are about the  same size, have large windows that let in tons=
 of light and great cross  currents in warmer weather, but all stay the per=
fect warmth during the  winter. It's a 4th floor walk up in an old building=
 with lots of  character - friendly neighbors who I never hear but say hi t=
o in the  stairway.  <br /> <br /> I currently live here alone, and work fr=
om home when I'm not travelling -  but I am getting a studio and will be wo=
rking from there much of the  time. The pictures are about a year old but s=
how the place quite well,  and some of the stuff will be moved to my studio=
 so it won't have as  much of my work things. I'm actually open to renting =
out either room and  moving stuff around to accommodate. The apt is furnish=
ed, so a sublet  set-up would be best as there isn't a ton of storage space=
. Even though  it's small, I've had a number of fantastic roommates in the =
past and  it's a really cozy place to share, especially if, like me, you wo=
rk a  lot and have a nice life outside the house. <br /> <br /> The rent is=
 $800 per month, and that includes all utilities (heat, WIFI,  etc, but not=
 airconditioning... though if you want to put one in and  pay for it you're=
 more than welcome to). I'm pretty flexible with move  in date and length -=
 but would love to get someone in March to stay at  least a month or two, i=
deally longer.  If you're interested but not sure  about timing, get in tou=
ch anyway as maybe we can work it out. <br /> <br /> I am a documentary fil=
mmaker and editor - I travel about a week a month  on production, and the r=
est of the time I work freelance, mainly  editing. I work a lot, but I also=
 love to unwind with a glass of wine at  a neighborhood bar, or a movie or =
reading at home. Like most people,  I'm both very social and need some shut=
 off private time. I'm easy going  and considerate, have a tidy and clean b=
ut slightly cluttered style,  and would like to find someone similar who wi=
ll clean up after  themselves but not be anal.  I have small dinner parties=
 at the house  sometimes, but mostly it's a place I come to to relax and to=
odle around.   It's important to me that I roommate with someone who I can =
say hello  to in the morning and have a nice chat every once in a while, bu=
t I'm  also happy to give you your space. <br /> <br /> I really love this =
part of Greenpoint - it's both quiet and safe, a  little off the beaten tra=
ck but not too much to be a hassle, and has  enough bars and restaurants an=
d plenty of cafes.  There are literally 3  of my favorite cafes within walk=
ing distance, great neighborhood bars as  well as two lovely wine bars, a g=
reat pizza place, fab polish food, a  shnazzy cheese and wine place, one of=
 the best natural grocery stores in  BK, etc, etc! There are a lot of artis=
ts in the neighborhood, and it's  on the quieter side from Williamsburg and=
 south Greenpoint and it has a  great neighborhood vibe. We are right by th=
e G train which links up with  the L into Manhattan. We are also right by t=
he 7 train and it takes 20  mins to get to Times Square. <br /> <br /> Than=

0 per month, Park Slope, 12 X 8 1/2, Sun drenched 12 X 8 1/2  room in cozy =
Park Slope apt<br /> Available: March 1 through whenever<br /><br /> Room i=
s in the 2nd floor apartment of a two story house on 12th Street  near 7th =
Avenue, Park Slope. It is 12 X 8 =BD, has a window overlooking a  garden, i=
s sun-filled and very quiet. Rent is $850.00 per month, W-Fi  included. Uti=
lities are $30.00 per month. <br /> <br /> The room is big enough for a que=
en size bed, dresser and chair..or a  twin bed which would then allow room =
for a small desk as well. There is a  clothes closet with a storage shelf i=
n the private upstairs landing  which would be for the exclusive use of the=
 roommate. There is also room  for storing a bicycle in an empty space adjo=
ining the stairwell. The  room is being rented unfurnished, however I would=
 consider providing  some furniture if necessary. Also I have a queen or tw=
in size airbed  that I can provide temporarily, but it would not be a long =
term  solution...these beds tend to leak air after long term use.<br /> <br=
 /> The apartment itself is 600 sf and is newly renovated, with an all new =
 kitchen, bathroom, refinished hardwood floors, and beautiful new paint  jo=
b. It is two small flights up from street level. <br /> <br /> Although the=
 apartment is a one bedroom, I am using it as a two bedroom  (the "living r=
oom" being the 2nd bedroom). The bedrooms are private,  with doors, and sit=
uated on either side of the large kitchen which  includes a small common ar=
ea with a table and chairs. The entrance to  the apartment opens into the k=
itchen. <br /> <br /> Re the Kitchen: It is dream for someone who likes to =
cook..brand new 5  burner range and stove, giant new refrigerator, and new =
very spacious  cabinets. It is fully outfitted with kitchen stuff like dish=
es, pots,  pans, knives, forks, cups, bowls, blender, toaster, etc., and a =
 cappuccino machine. <br /> <br /> The bathroom is shared and is situated o=
ne window away from the room for  rent, so is very convenient for a roommat=
e. The bathroom has a window,  gets lots of light, and has a very large bat=
htub and shower.<br /> <br /> The apartment is also home to two friendly ca=
ts which basically stay in  my room unless invited out by the roommate. If =
you have a cat that you  would like to bring with you that is negotiable, a=
lthough I would prefer  not having any more animals in the apt. <br /> <br =
/> Note:* The apartment and entire building is a No-Smoking environment. So=
  if you smoke you would have to do it outside of the building. <br /> <br =
/> Room is available starting March 1 which is when my current roommate is =
 moving out to start living with her boyfriend. To move in you will need  f=
irst month's rent in advance plus one month's rent as Security Deposit.  <b=
r /> <br /> About me: <br /> Photographer, male, 70's, work in the arts, ha=
ng out with artists and  academics. Spend very little time at home, mostly =
working in my studio,  or out with friends. When I'm home I like the space =
to be a respite from  the somewhat hectic life I lead outside of it, and wo=
uld hope that a  roommate would have that same feeling about their living s=
pace. <br /> <br /> About you:<br /> Somehow connected to the arts, able to=
 pay the rent on time, reasonably  neat, considerate of others, done with y=
our partying days, or if not, at  least not into bringing the party home. <=
br /> <br /> It would be nice if we had enough in common so that when we pa=
ss each  other coming in or out, or happen to be in the common space at the=
 same  time, we might engage in some interesting bits of conversation, but =
that  would be a plus, not a necessity. <br /> <br /> The neighborhood is f=
ull of great restaurants, bars, cafes, shops of  every description, Park Sl=
ope Food Coop and other food stores, &  many laundromats, Zipcar garage dow=
n the street, F & B trains a  block away, and the R a five minute walk; Two=
 blocks from the 5th Ave  bus line, =BD block from the 7th Ave bus lines, 4=
 blocks to a YMCA with a  great pool, and Yoga all over the place.<br /><br=

 /> Available: 3/1/2013 through 8/31/2013<br /><br /> I'm moving out of my =
room in this 2 BR in Greenpoint near McGorlick  Park. The apartment is a th=
ird floor walk-up and is railroad-style, with  high ceilings, original mold=
ings, built-in shelves, and other details.  The apartment is about 10 block=
s from the G train and a 20 minute walk  to the L. The B48 bus stops across=
 the street, and a B24 bus stop is one  block away. There is a grocery stor=
e and laundromat within a couple of  blocks. This is a nice little pocket o=
f Greenpoint that's very relaxed  and quiet.<br /> <br /> This is for the m=
iddle room in the railroad, which is about 13x8 feet.  There are built-in d=
rawers and shelves (the shelves are the perfect size  for records), and a l=
arge and deep closet. There are no windows, but  there's a glass panel abov=
e the door between rooms and the room gets a  decent amount of natural ligh=
t. I will leave my bed (full-size) and desk  if a prospective tenant or sub=
letter is interested in them. Rent is  $900 a month, and utilities (electri=
c, gas, cable) average $50 a month.  The security deposit is one month's re=
nt. Would prefer to stay at least  through the end of this lease (which is =
up at the end of August),  although 1+ month subletters can work.<br /> <br=
 /> About my roommate: Guy, 25, Works in an office in Manhattan and run a  =
record label. No pets but likes dogs and can tolerate a cat (cats have  to =
be cleared with the landlord). Looking for someone who's responsible,  rela=
xed, able to pay rent and utilities on time, and reasonably clean.  Non-smo=
kers preferred. Has friends stay over about once a month, and is  accommoda=
ting if you have friends who want to stay over (within reason).  If you're =
interested, please email me and tell me a little about  yourself.<br /><br =

00 per month, Williamsburg, 1400 square foot loft, big furnished bedroom in=
 huge loft off Bedford L train for 2 month sublet<br /> Available: March 1s=
t through April 30th<br /><br /> Looking for a roommate to take over my roo=
m while I'm away for an art  residency in Iceland for March and April. Live=
 in a fully furnished 1400  square foot, four bedroom open loft off the Bed=
ford Avenue L train in  an art-filled fully furnished bedroom. The loft has=
 a big open kitchen  with skylight and a large common area with wall to wal=
l windows. It's  located in the thick of Williamsburg only 4 blocks away fr=
om the L train  (10 minutes to Union Square) and easy walking/biking distan=
ce to all  the great restaurants, bars, and shops the neighborhood has to o=
ffer.  Having lived here for the past 8 years I can attest to the amazing  =
location and convenience of living in the neighborhood at this specific  ap=
artment.<br /> <br /> The remaining three roommates are hardworking, clean,=
 friendly and  motivated late-20 year-olds, two girls and a guy: an environ=
mental  scientist master chef, a 9-5 finance athlete, and a camera assistan=
t for  tv, films, and commercials. We keep a quiet, tidy, and respectful  a=
tmosphere about the apartment so if you're loud, unkempt, and a jerk,  plea=
se don't respond to this post! We keep very busy with our work  responsibil=
ities and various activities (going to art galleries/museums,  traveling, g=
oing to concerts, cooking, training, at the studio, etc.)  It's a rarity fo=
r us to all be at the apartment at the same time but if  we are we at least=
 share a conversation, if not a drink or dinner, to  catch up. We're defini=
tely not crazy party people but we do occasionally  enjoy crazy parties, ju=
st not in our apartment.<br /> <br /> If you think this seems like a good f=
it please respond to the post as  soon as possible to schedule a time to se=
e the apartment. Ideally you  are an interesting person with a full-time re=
sponsibility (school and/or  job) and keep relatively normal hours (no stay=
 up all night vampires  please) who does not use hardcore drugs (ever) or s=
moke inside the  apartment. We discourage work-from-home hermit types and  =
bar/club/late-night lifestyles compared to our own. It would be helpful  if=
 you've lived in a loft before but not necessary, so long as you're  aware =
and respectful of others. The room is only available for March and  April b=
ut we'd like to attract responsible-planning-ahead-types so  please contact=
 us as soon as possible.<br /> <br /> All utilities are included in the $13=
00 per month rent (heat, water,  gas, electric, cable, internet, everything=
). A one month security  deposit will be required and ultimately used for y=
our last month's stay  so long as you don't burn the apartment down. So to =
move-in the total is  $2600 and you're good to go for both months of your s=
tay.<br /> <br /> I'm allergic to cats so no-go for felines. We love dogs a=
nd dog-sit  sporadically but we're very hesitant to invite along a full-tim=
e 5th  roommate, especially if he/she drools, smells, and barks (this goes =
for  pets and significant others, no couples).<br /><br /> <a style=3D"colo=

eat and talk but if you host an occassional party, that's fine.<br /> <br /=

It's  a wonderful, quirky space. This is a large apartment formerly used by=
 a  painter working on massive panels. <br /> <br /> I have internet servic=

 The apartment also comes with an upright piano.<br /> <br /> Rent is $1400=

 artist couple with a baby and a "strange" credit record, it was very hard =
getting an apt. in this neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Now that we are moving =
to Europe, we would love to pass it on to someone in need of a child friend=
ly home. <br /> <br /> The apt is a spacious 2 bedroom with lots of light a=

 kitchen  including dishwasher. The apt is a so-called butterfly shape - li=
ving  room, dining and kitchen in the front, bathroom in the middle, and 2 =
 bedrooms (one large and one small) in the back. <br /> <br /> Or you could=
 call it: Party in the front, baby in the back :) <br /> <br /> The apt is =
on the 3rd floor (2nd floor in European terms) of a classic  Brooklyn brown=
stone. Set on a tree-lined street right by Prospect Park  with all its runn=
ing options, playgrounds and general niceness. Walk the  other way and you =
are surrounded by bars, shops and restaurants. <br /> <br /> Everyone in ou=
r building are super friendly and the same goes for the landlord. <br /> <b=
r /> This is a great place to live. We hope to be able to pass it on to oth=
er great people.<br /> <br /> There is no broker fee (usually 15% of the an=
nual rent) but we have made  investments of about $2,000 that we would like=
 returned.<br /> <br /> If anyone is interested, we will be leaving most of=
 our furniture behind.<br /><br /> <a style=3D"color: black;" shape=3D"rect=

 /> Apartment includes large bedroom with luxury raised queen sized bed and=
  32" flat screen TV connected to Netflix and Amazon movie streaming. Wifi =
 available for your use. Central air conditioning for hot summer days,  lar=

ving area includes a fully-equipped open kitchen, small table with  two cha=
irs, small leather couch, and work space with two desks. It's  minimally fu=
rnished as I mostly use it as my art studio and the space is  great if you =
need to work on art that's not too messy. I request that  you put down a ta=
rp if you plan to paint as the floors are new. There's a  small trampoline,=
 hand weights, and yoga mats available for your use.  Nice bathroom with sm=
all bathtub. I love to cook and a fully equipped  kitchen is available for =
your to use, also. Large, safe, family-oriented  building with a shared dec=
k downstairs and a shared laundry room. <br /> <br /> Price is negotiable f=
or the right person and includes all utilities:  Gas, Electric (please use =
smartly as I'm charging a flat rate), Heat,  Water, Wifi internet. This is =
a rent-stabilized building so I am looking  for 1 quiet house sitter to tak=
e over my home while I am away. I ask  that you are quiet and respectful of=
 the space: friends are okay, but no  big parties while staying here. No sm=
oking or pets are allowed in the  building. I'm very clean in my space and =
hope that you would be too or  at least leave the space clean. Linens are a=
vailable if you need them.  Apartment comes furnished and closet and dresse=
r can be cleared out as  needed for your stay.<br /> <br /> Cute restaurant=
s nearby on Lewis Ave (Saraghina Brick Oven Pizza, The  Pantry Coffee Shop,=
 and Peaches). Super Foodtown is a short 5 minute  walk away and carries or=
ganic produce. Three minute walk to A/C subway  to Utica or Kingston Throop=
, and accesible to Park Slope, Williamsburg,  and other brooklyn neighborho=
ods by subway and bus.<br /> <br /> I've subletted through Stephanie's List=
 before with great results, so  have the process down. Asking for full 2 mo=
nth's rent in advance in  order to secure sublet, in addition to a $200 dep=
osit which I will  return to you 2 weeks after end of sublet after inspecti=
ng that  apartment is cleaned and no items are missing. Sublet agreement wi=
ll be  provided and distant subletters can set up a skype meeting with me i=
f  it's not possible to meet in person. Cash or check is preferred but  Pay=
pal is acceptable for international subletters. When payment is  completely=

30 per month, Fort Greene, 400, Beautiful Fort Greene Walk-Up with Amazing =
Views of Manhattan/Brooklyn<br /> Available: March 1 through June 1<br /><b=
r /> I am looking to sublet my apartment ASAP - willing to start March 1st,=
  or discuss mid-March/April as well, for a sublet to June 1st with an  opt=
ion to take over the lease (if you're interested).<br /> <br /> It's a trul=
y beautiful 4th floor walk-up in a gorgeous Fort Greene  neighborhood. Fort=
 Greene is one of the best areas in Brooklyn; it's a  historic district; yo=
u're minutes from Fort Greene park; you're within a  10-minute walk to BAM,=
 Barclays Center, Atlantic Center (Target, Best  Buy, etc). The bars and re=
staurants are fantastic, as well. <br /> <br /> The apartment can remain fu=
rnished until June, or can be unfurnished  when you move in; whichever you =
prefer. I have a couch; large, beautiful  Restoration hardware desk; a dres=
ser, queen-sized bed, and 55-in HDTV.  The bedroom has two large closets wi=
th storage room above, as well as a  hall closet. You have gorgeous views o=
f downtown Brookyn and the  southern tip of Manhattan/Manhattan Bridge. You=
're also a top-floor  apartment, so no noise from above.<br /> <br /> The a=
partment is already equipped with internet if you'd like it, and  the telev=
ision streams Netflix in HD, etc. I also have a PS3 I'm willing  to leave, =
if you're interested.<br /> <br /> More than anything, I'm looking for a re=
sponsible, clean, quiet tenant  (or tenants - it's great for a couple, and =
I occupied the apartment for a  year and a half with my girlfriend) to take=
 my place for a few months  or beyond. If you take the sublet you have firs=
t crack at the lease  (which will be raised to about $1,660 in June).<br />=

the heart of Williamsburg, Brooklyn<br /> Available: 4/1/13<br /><br /> I'm=
 selling my open 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom floor-thru. The 800sf  apartment was=
 fully renovated in 2004 and features W/D, stainless steel  appliances, bam=
boo floors, ray doors, pressed tin ceilings, fantastic  closets, built in s=
helving, caged storage unit, and a shared back patio.  The apartment is on =
the 3rd floor and receives tons of natural light.  It is conveniently locat=
ed just 3 blocks from the Bedford Ave L train  and McCarren Park in a very =
"up" neighborhood that offers everything one  would need within walking dis=
tance.<br /> <br /> About the co-op: There are no impending improvements; t=
he boiler was  recently replaced. Maintenance is $250 per month. The buildi=
ng is an  HDFC (meaning it's zoned for low income inhabitants and has some =
tax  benefits) and has an income cap which is something like 100K, just for=
  the year in which you buy the place.  <br /> <br /> Move-in date is flexi=

t<br /> Available: 3/1/13 through any<br /><br /> Hey Listers, I am current=
ly looking for a room for rent or studio  apartment to sublet in Brooklyn. =
I've lived in New York all my life, and  do my best to spend most of my tim=
e either working or out and about.  When I am home, I enjoy reading, cookin=
g (so a nice fully working and  clean kitchen is a must), and catching up o=
n Hulu. I work in the  restaurant industry so my hours are a little wonky, =
but if you work  during the day you will hardly ever see me. <br /> <br /> =
I'm currently living in Prospect Heights with a woman who works in  fashion=
, and as much as I like the apartment, she is not clean at all.  This is so=
mething that I am looking for in the next space. I'm not a  wake up every m=
orning and scrub every surface kind of person, but I do  like to maintain a=
 clean and well tended to household. I'm not looking  to re-live college ye=
ars. <br /> <br /> I'd love to explore the possibility of either finding an=
 apartment with  someone or looking at rooms for rent in already establishe=
d apartments,  keeping in mind that I do have a good deal of kitchen stuff.=
 <br /> <br /> I am and ask that you be: <br /> pet friendly (I don't have =
pets, and if living in an apartment that mandates no pets then that's fine,=
 but I am a cat lover)<br /> 420 friendly (I'm not a wake and bake type per=
sonality, but every once  in a while I do enjoy unwinding with said substan=
ce, I don't do other  drugs)<br /> Generally speaking a lot of fun! I love =
to cook and share, so if you  like to eat, and are looking for some of the =
same things as me, get in  touch!<br /><br /> Please contact Samantha Moret=
