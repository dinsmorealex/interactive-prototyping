$450.00 Per Month, East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 200 sq. ft., Sublet/Lease T=
akeover
Available: Dec 01, 2013 through Apr 30, 2014

Hello,
I am looking for someone to take over my studio lease beginning December 1s=
t.=20
The studio is located in 1013 Grand st studios in East Williamsburg and is =
decent sized measuring just under 200 actual square feet, it is part of a l=
arger space shared with two other artists that has been divided railroad st=
yle. It feels pretty private and is at the far end of the space, so neither=
 of the other two artists have to cut through to get to their spaces. The l=
andlord won't allow further subdivides so this space can only be taken by o=
ne person.=20

It will be available for move in around November 18th.=20

My landlords work in the building and are very responsive and helpful. The =
bathrooms stay well stocked with soap and paper towels. The building uses a=
 keycard for entry, and is generally pretty secure.=20

The cost is $450 per month, plus a flat fee for utilities of $30. This incl=
udes heat, water, electric, and wifi. There is a common slop sink for the e=
ntire floor and trash removal. Tenants are responsible for offsite disposal=
 of solvents or oil based paint.=20

Welding and kilns are not permitted.
First month, and a deposit of $960 are required to secure the space.=20
I like this space a lot, but had the opportunity to share a space with some=
 friends otherwise I would not be moving at all. It's a great location and =
is easy to get to by train, bike and bus. It gets great light during the da=
y, and the building is generally pretty quiet.=20

$500.00 Per Month, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, 180 sq. ft., Private Studio + Shar=
ed Studio at 67 West
Available: Nov 15, 2013 through Nov 15, 2014

1. $500/ mo. which includes all utilities. 180 sq.ft. Private. Nov. 15th. T=
he studio is located on the 6th floor of the Greenpoint Terminal Building a=
t 67 West Street. It is a space subdivided from my personal studio on the 6=
th floor. (I also run Fowler Arts Collective on the 2nd Floor of the same b=
uilding.) This a great private room with a locking door, full walls, high s=
peed internet, and a quiet atmosphere. I do have a friendly dog that hangs =
out some days, so if you have a dog, he/she would be most welcome! The stud=
io does not have a window to the outside though there are windows at the to=
p of the wall allowing in natural light while preserving privacy. Because o=
f this, the space would probably not suit someone using toxic/ high fume ma=
terials. I mostly work in photo/video with a little painting thrown in the =
mix.

2. $365/ mo. which includes all utilities. A shared 270 sq.ft studio with a=
 window. Nov. 15th. This studio is located within Fowler Arts Collective on=
 the 2nd floor of 67 West. The sculptor who is in the space is looking for =
a new roommate whose share of the rent will be $365. Fowler is a studio and=
 gallery collective that was founded in 2010 and is artist-run. For more in=
formation on Fowler, go here: http://www.fowlerartsbrooklyn.org

67 West is a great building with a growing artist community!

$250.00 Per Month, Gowanus, Brooklyn, 140 sq. ft., Seeking one artist for g=
reat studio share!
Available: Nov 01, 2013

Hello, I am currently looking for someone to share my studio with starting =
in Nov. There would just be two of us using the space. We each pay $250 per=
 month, first and last month needed to move in. The space is 140 sq feet, n=
ewly renovated, with nice natural light from open ceiling. Heat, electricit=
y, wifi, bathroom (with shower), slop sink included, as well as exhibition =
opportunities. Work only, no live in. It's a month-to-month rental but I am=
 looking for someone long term.

I work a freelance job outside the studio and will not be using the space d=
aily, which often gives the other artist the space to themselves. I am look=
ing for someone with a similar situation. Perfect for an illustrator, graph=
ic designer, writer, or someone working on smaller scale pieces. The studio=
 is near the F/G 4th Ave stop, and R 9th St stop in Brooklyn. There's suppl=
ies, nice cafes, and bars nearby. The people who run the building are very =
friendly and helpful. It's a great space for a reasonable price! Responsibl=
e folks only please!

If interested please email me a bit about yourself and your studio needs. L=
ook forward to hearing from you!=20

$950.00 Per Month, Bushwick, Brooklyn, 1100 sq. ft., A spacious room in the=
 back of the house with soft sunlight and tranquility
Available: Nov 08, 2013

We have a large room available in a beautiful brand new 3br apartment in a =
brand new building in Bushwick, Brooklyn.

As you guys know, everyone is moving to Bushwick. This particular apartment=
 is brand new (no one has every lived in it before) and so is the building.=
 It really is gorgeous. I have been apartment hunting for past 2-3 months a=
nd I have not seen anything better than this for the price.
The apartment is very spacious (1100 Sq ft. in total) and so is the room av=
ailable for rent as well as the closet inside. Dishwasher along with brand =
new appliances and beautiful cabinets. Also, Laundry is on site in the buil=
ding!!! (yay)
=20
Also, we have central heat/AC, which definitely will help us save money.
It is an unfurnished apartment so you would have to bring your furniture fo=
r the room. If you need a futon to sleep on temporarily then please tell us=
, we can have one ready for you.

Rent: 950 + Utilities (Electricity, Cooking Gas, Internet) - we can talk ab=
out getting cable, if it is in a bundle with the internet or something.
Rent: can be a flat price that's higher than 950 that will include all the =
utilities if that's easier for you. We can talk about this if you are inter=
ested in this option.

You will be living with 2 people (including me) that are amazing cooks and =
really into music (we like to think we have good taste in music). We are ve=
ry easy going and chill - love being social but also know how to respect ot=
her's privacy. I work as an art director/designer and the other roommate is=
 a student studying music/business.

Ideal roommate for us would be someone who like to chill with us every now =
and then and share the responsibilities of house keeping. Also, if you are =
also into music, you get major brownie points!

$950.00 Per Month, Bushwick and BedStuy border, Brooklyn, 200 sq. ft., Larg=
e, spacious room with great light
Available: Dec 01, 2013

we are looking for a 3rd roommate, preferably female, in our quiet 3 bedroo=
m apartment on the border of Bushwick and Bedstuy. the room available is ve=
ry spacious, with 2 windows and great light and a massive closet.=20

about us:=20
-27 year old female artist fabricator, works a 9-5 job
-34 year old female filmmaker, occasionally works from home

we like to keep the apartment really clean, so we are looking for someone w=
ho does too. the common space/kitchen is cozy, so the apartment is not a pl=
ace to party or have lots of people over. ideally we'd like someone who wor=
ks more in the afternoon or has a night schedule, but it's ok too if you do=
n't. also there's one vegetarian in the house, so if you cook a ton of meat=
 really frequently (occasionally is cool!), it might not be a great fit.

the apartment is 3 blocks from the JMZ Myrtle ave stop and is walkable dist=
ance from the Morgan L train and the Myrtle/Willoughby G train stop. cafes,=
 bars, and good grocery stores nearby.

Available December 1st, longterm.

$1,200.00 Per Month, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, New York, Room available in spac=
ious, homey 2BRlots of light
Available: Dec 01, 2013

Room available in lovely 2BR box in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.
The apartment is the top floor of a three-story building. The living spaces=
 are generously-sized; large living room, full-sized kitchen replete with d=
ishwasher. The bedrooms are a little more modest, but the living spaces' br=
eadth allow for collaborative arrangement. The bedrooms are situated on opp=
osite sides of the apartment; the available room off of the living room, mi=
ne off of the kitchen. The apartment gets great light (windows on three sid=
es) and offers a nice reprieve from the claustrophobic squeeze of the city.

The culture of the building is homey and fairly quiet. The landlord (a very=
 good one) and his wife live on the first floor, and a kind couple (who has=
 lived in the building for about thirty years) lives on the second. It's im=
portant to me that whomever fills this vacancy is reverent of the rest of t=
he building. It's a terrific place to live with a nice dynamic.

The room is available on December 1. Rent is $1200, plus half of monthly ut=
ilities (electric, gas, Internet [heat and hot water are gratis]). No secur=
ity deposit is required. The G train, the closest laundromat, and closest g=
rocery store are all just a block's walk. The apartment is convenient to al=
l of the great trappings of the neighborhood, and Williamsburg is just down=
 the way.

I'm a 28 year-old book publicist, and as a roommate I am respectful, easy-g=
oing, and accommodatinglooking for something similar. According to the outg=
oing roommate, I am &quot;not home a lot,&quot; &quot;occasionally bothered=
 to cook,&quot; and &quot;the best.&quot; The dissolution of our living tog=
ether is amicable (she's engaged). Were she not starting a new chapter in e=
arnest we would have kept right on keeping on, which I suppose is some kind=
 of testament to my quality as a roommate.

$1,200.00 Per Month, Clinton Hill-Bedstuy, Brooklyn, Room w/office space an=
d backyard
Available: Nov 05, 2013

Room available with anteroom/office, both have closets so you will actually=
 have two closets available for use. The office or anteroom is in-between t=
he kitchen and hallway to bedrooms, so we walk through it to get to our bed=
rooms but it will be entirely your space to do with as you please. There's =
also a basement which you can use for storage if you'd like.

The living room gets a lot of light throughout the day and there's a great,=
 sizable backyard where folks hang out and have cookouts or a bonfire.
It's roughly a 4 minute walk to the Bedford-Nostrand G train stop. The hear=

att, which has some great places to eat and buy groceries.

I'm looking for someone in their late 20s-early 30s, gainfully employed, an=
d okay with dogs. There is a 8-month old black lab who is very sweet and ho=
use trained, I will of course not expect you to take part in taking care of=
 him (his name is Phife Dog) but it would be nice if you're comfortable wit=
h dogs.

About me: I'm in my mid 30s, work in media in midtown Manhattan, have lived=
 in new york for roughly 20 years. I occasionally have a friend or two over=
, but am not into throwing parties or &quot;bringing the party home&quot; a=
s they say. This is a great situation for a person who is okay with a littl=
e socializing but also wants some privacy, as I'm the same.

$1,100.00 Per Month, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 72 sq. ft., Cozy furnished roo=
m in amazing Williamsburg apartment
Available: Nov 30, 2013 through Jan 01, 2014

I am going on vacation for the month of December (YAY!) and hoping to suble=
t my room. It's a mini gem of a room (8x9 feet) in a big cozy apartment. Ro=
om just fits a comfy double bed and a dresser, cupboard and wardrobe, the a=
vailable space in which is negotiable depending on what you need. It's smal=
l but I've lived in it for nearly 3 years and love it! I like to think of i=
t as a luxurious ships's cabin... it has a window onto the yard and is quie=
t and peaceful.=20
You will share the rest of the fully furnished apartment (big kitchen you c=
an actually cook in, dining/office area, living room ) with a sweet and res=
pectful late-20s gay man. Apartment has back porch and big yard which might=
 not be the most helpful in December, but with global warming, who knows!? =
It's in what I think is the best neighborhood in North Brooklyn, with tons =
of great restaurants, bars, shopping, organic 24-hour bodegas, etc, but sti=
ll neighborhood-y and very safe. Apartment is 2 1/2 short blocks from the L=
 train at Graham Ave and across the street from 24/7 laundry.=20
$1100 includes utilities and wi-fi for the month, use of bed and linens and=
 some storage space in room, as well as the rest of the shared space and sh=
ared stuff in the apartment, including a great and well-equipped kitchen an=
d a sleeper couch and roku'd TV in the living room. You can even compost if=
 you want!
I leave in the morning November 30 and return in the evening January 1 so t=

$700.00 Per Month, Bed Stuy, Brooklyn, 400 sq. ft., Huge, light room availa=
ble immediately! Beautiful backyard, utilities included in rent
Available: Nov 03, 2013

Looking for a female roommate for a huge, light-filled bedroom in a 3-br, 2=
 story brownstone apartment. You can move in asap! Please read entire ad be=
fore replying.

The roommates: two women, 27 and 28. I write plays and work as a videograph=
er and freelance tutor, my roommate works nights in a restaurant and is als=
o in music production. We're both fairly quiet and low-key and the apartmen=
t has a peaceful, private vibe. The occasional party is welcome as long as =
there's fair warning.

The available room is about 400 square ft, with big windows and a wooden fl=
oor, and comes with a queen bed and some weirdly beautiful hand-carved shel=
ving. The room is semi-private (divided by a curtain) from my office space,=
 which I use as a reading/writing/storage area. I don't spend a lot of time=
 there, and I've set up several screens so there's visual privacy from both=
 sides and either of us can come and go without seeing the other. You will =
not be bothered!

Other perks/relevant facts about the place...utilities are included in the =
rent, there's a giant beautiful overgrown backyard with assorted outdoor fu=
rniture, including yard cats who stare ominously through the kitchen window=
s; the kitchen is spacious and good for cooking and making eye contact with=
 cats through the window. The landlady lives upstairs and is pretty prompt =
about taking care of issues. There's also a good amount of extra storage sp=
ace in the apt.

We're looking for someone who is 1) female, 2) wants a quiet, low-key place=
 to live, preferably for a while 3) pays rent on time, and 4) is reliable a=
nd mature and respectful.=20

Please tell us a little bit about yourself and when you can come see the pl=
ace. We're looking to fill the room immediately, so the sooner the better.=
=20

Thanks, and good luck!

$1,500.00 Per Month, Ivry Port/13th, Paris, France, 2000 sq. ft., Spectacul=
ar artist loft/home/studio on edge Paris 13th.
Available: Nov 01, 2013 through Dec 31, 2014

I'm an artist and I own a fabulous loft on the edge of Paris 13th, 3 metro =
stops from St Michel /Notre Dame, close to the river seine, in a converted =
factory, with communal garden.  It is really rare to find this sort of spac=
e in Paris, especially since as you sit in the sun taking your croissant an=
d coffee , you feel nearly rural in the garden!  I am traveling a lot now, =
and my daughter has left home, so I am left with a huge space I would like =
to share with other appreciative artists, and to give an opportunity to liv=
e and work in Paris. I have one young (25) Italian artist staying here alre=
ady, and I could house another 3, since I have three bedrooms available.  I=
 charge 1500 dollars all inclusive, per person, this includes double bedroo=
m, utilities, internet etc. I would prefer stays of a minimum of three mont=
hs but I'm open to shorter offers, or longer stays are possible.  I would l=
ike a mixture of artists and personalities, but since this is my home I do =
ask a minimum amount of respect for my home and property. It's not an unfin=
ished factory, so would not suit really dirty work, though there is a court=
yard which can be used for some more mechanical work. It's really easy to g=
et around Paris by public transport or walking, and you will be surrounded =
by other artists, since this area has the highest concentration of artists =
in France.  There is a web site on this area, http://www.usines-art-ivry.co=
m/ and this one is Moliere.=20

Available: Nov 02, 2013

Hello ,
I'm looking for a roommate and am open to both December 1st or asap options=
 as I'm the sole occupant at the moment.

The apartment is a railroad and I'm offering two rooms to one person for $7=
50/month. I am open to living with a couple for $1000. It's a great neighbo=
rhood with lots of families and a children's school on the block. Laundry a=
round the corner, plus lots of shops both local (Mexican food here is inexp=
ensive and exceptional) and large (Target, Costco, Bed Bath etc. 2 blocks a=
way) I've lived here for 11 years, so let's get the tour started:
The front room and kitchen. Nice light, especially in the afternoons. Furni=
shed with a large 6'x6' shelving cube unit. While two cats are pictured, th=
ere is only one in the apartment. The front room is 15'x8'

The second view from the kitchen. You can see straight through all 3 rooms

The middle/bedroom, furnished with two twin mattresses, 3 lamps, a desk, ch=
air, shelving unit, nightstand and a large closet (not pictured).

The middle bedroom has a home made wall that goes from the ceiling to the f=
loor to provide privacy.I am offering both the front room and the living ro=
om together for 900.Great if you are an artist or want to set up a computer=
/gaming station or office / work space that is separate from where you slee=
p. These rooms are very quiet also.

About myself: I'm an artist and split my time between working as a columnis=
t for Vice and as a bookkeeper in the health food industry. I cook a bit an=
d would describe myself as friendly. While working from home I'm usually li=
stening to podcasts or music (quietly). I've lived in the city my whole lif=
e and am at ease with a variety of people, keep the place moderately clean =
and am career focused. I have a girlfriend and usually stay at her place on=
ce a week. The...

I stay busy and am often not at home. While at home, I am friendly and quie=
t. I'm easy going and considerate w/ a sense of humor. Clean but not obsess=
ive.  I'm social, but always meet people outside the apartment. I'm a non-s=
moker, non-TV-watcher, mostly vegetarian. No pets of my own, just a few pla=
nts. In short, a low impact, great roommate :)

I also work as a professional web developer. Stable finances. Always paid r=
ent on time. Always gotten deposits back. Can provide letter of reference f=
rom previous landlord.

What I'm seeking:
A room in a happy, healthy home with male(s) or females(s). Fine with pets,=
 couples, etc. I'm open and flexible on most things but prefer not to live =
with indoor cigarette smoker or heavy TV-watcher in common spaces.

Prefer a room at least 120 SF if possible, but overall good living situatio=
n is more important. I'm not a mole; room must have windows.

Where:
Brooklyn (Williamsburg, Greenpoint, Fort Greene, Prospect Heights, Gowanus,=
 Cobble Hill, Boerum Hill, Carroll Gardens, Sunset Park, Park slope, Greenw=
ood, South Slope, Clinton Hill, Bushwick, ...), Downtown/LES, LIC

Price:=20
$750-1350ish depending on location, size, storage, amenities, etc...

Available: Dec 01, 2013

We are two friends (a man and a woman) in our mid twenties seeking a two be=
droom apartment or a long term two bedroom sublet in Brooklyn, Queens, or H=
arlem. Chris is a curator and works for a gallery in Chelsea. Abigail is a =
writer and photographer. We are responsible, clean, hard working, and will =
be on time with rent. A pre-furnished apartment is fine and we will take ca=
re of any furniture left behind.=20

We are also open to additional roommates.

Thanks! We look forward to hearing from you.

$1,100.00 Per Month, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Practically Anywhere, NYC, Swell =
couple looking for place to hang our hats.
Available: Nov 15, 2013

Hello,

We are a couple  looking to rent a room for short-term (4-6 months) or poss=
ibly longer.  We are flexible.   Looking for a room somewhere around $1100.=
  I work at a clothing store and write and my boyfriend works at a bookstor=
e in Manhattan I'm sure you've heard of, if not go to often.  I know that p=
eople don't prefer renting to couples but I assure you, we are respectful, =
clean, and not on the stupid-side.  (Unless we go to the wrong side of the =
train and ride completely in the wrong direction!)  We often keep to oursel=
ves, but also occasionally enjoy rooftop drinks with our current roommates.=
  These girls are available to vouch for us, all 3 of them.  Females: don't=
 worry about this dude.  He will replace the toilet paper.  Or if he forget=
s, I will do it and later nudge him and mummer something constructive about=
 replacing toilet paper.  And fellas? I will not get lipstick all over the =
kitchen table--this I swear.  Perhaps people don't enjoy couples because th=
ey may argue, but we have been in a lovely relationship for several years a=
nd think our love is the greatest, etc. etc.  We moved to NYC from Iowa and=
 adore going to museums, movies, and discovering the city.  Also like meeti=
ng new people and hearing their stories.  To sum it up, we are just looking=
 for some cool people (or a cool person, or even an okish person) who has a=
 room we can rent.  We will take good care of it. =20

Much thanks.  =20

Studio for sublet, $600.00 Per Month, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, Private Studio =
with Lots of Sunlight
Available: Nov 01, 2013

Hi, I'm looking to sublet my private studio in a new arts building that jus=
t opened this spring in Greenpoint.=20

My room is about 120 sq ft and has a window that lets in lots of sunlight a=
nd opens easily for fresh air. The building itself is incredibly well maint=
ained, is always clean, has a full-time office manager and a building manag=
er on site to help with all sorts of stuff, has central air, a conference r=
oom you can sign up to use whenever, an outdoor patio, vending machines, ki=
tchenettes, a gallery you can use to display your work, security cameras, a=
n intercom door system, a lobby/hang out area... I could go on!  The buildi=
ng already has a friendly community vibe and often hosts events to encourag=
e meetings and collaboration among the artist/designer tenants. Has a fast =
wireless set up and all utilities are included in the rent!  They also allo=
w noisy, dirty work here! All forms of work are welcomed here (I'm a jewele=
r who did lots of grinding and hammering).  Building is a short walk from t=
he Greenpoint Ave. G line.

I'm very proud of the space and love working there, but I will not be using=
 it for the year while I work on launching a new business. I would prefer s=
omeone who will rent for the full year, but I am willing to consider shorte=
r sublets. The studio is available immediately and I am available to show i=
t during business hours and on nights/weekends. Please note the studio will=
 be unfurnished. Thanks!

and will not be using the space daily, which often gives the other artist t=

Perfect for an illustrator, graphic designer, writer, or someone working on=
 smaller scale pieces. The studio is near the F/G 4th Ave stop, and R 9th S=

or a reasonable price! Responsible folks only please!</p><p>If interested p=

ello,</p><p>We are a couple looking to rent a room for short-term (4-6 mont=
hs) or possibly longer. We are flexible. Looking for a room somewhere aroun=
d $1100. I work at a clothing store and write and my boyfriend works at a b=
ookstore in Manhattan I'm sure you've heard of, if not go to often. I know =
that people don't prefer renting to couples but I assure you, we are respec=
tful, clean, and not on the stupid-side. (Unless we go to the wrong side of=
 the train and ride completely in the wrong direction!) We often keep to ou=
rselves, but also occasionally enjoy rooftop drinks with our current roomma=
tes. These girls are available to vouch for us, all 3 of them. Females: don=
't worry about this dude. He will replace the toilet paper. Or if he forget=
s, I will do it and later nudge him and mummer something constructive about=
 replacing toilet paper. And fellas? I will not get lipstick all over the k=
itchen table--this I swear. Perhaps people don't enjoy couples because they=
 may argue, but we have been in a lovely relationship for several years and=
 think our love is the greatest, etc.... <a href=3D"http://r20.rs6.net/tn.j=
