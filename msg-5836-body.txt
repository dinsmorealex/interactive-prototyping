Hello, 

We have a study taking place on Tuesday February 11th,
2014, in Manhattan, paying $85 via check. We are looking for females and
males 25 - 49 who own an mobile phone. There are several time slots
available, select the one that works best for you.

  If you are
interested in applying:  

* Visit www.nyfocusgroups.com/projects [1]


* Click "apply" next to the group you are interested in. 

The survey
you will be filling out is just an eligibility survey and you will not
be compensated for filling it out. 

FAQ

I've been applying for
studies, but I haven't been picked. Why? 

It could be a number of
reasons. Perhaps the study is already full or you didn't meet all of the
criteria we were looking for. Don't be discouraged! You won't be
accepted for every focus group. Keep trying and you should get an
opportunity! 

It could also be that, the number you provided in you
profile isn't working, or you didn't provide a number for us to reach
you. Please take the time to update your profile, to ensure that you
have provided a current phone number. 

Thank you for your time and if
you have any questions please feel free to contact me.
