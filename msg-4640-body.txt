Dear Friends and Members=2C

It is my pleasure to bring you some exciting news and ask for your support=
 by investing in 3rd Ward (http://www.3rdward.com/invest) .
Since 3rd Ward opened in 2006=2C we have served over 6=2C000 members and 1=
8=2C000 students at our flagship location in Brooklyn=2C offering shared w=
orkspace and a dynamic educational program. This year we opened in Philade=
lphia as our second location and signed a lease for our third=2C a Culinar=
y version of 3rd Ward in Crown Heights=2C funded in part by the New York C=
ity Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC).  We=E2=80=99ve partnered wi=
th some great restaurateurs to help them open Fitzcarraldo=2C a fantastic=
 new restaurant at our flagship location. We=E2=80=99ve attracted investme=
nt interest from angel investors and lending institutions alike=2C and we=
 are grateful for their support.
This year has also brought some challenges. Supporting geographic expansio=
n has been expensive. In addition=2C a change we made to one of our member=
ships=2C in an effort to improve it=2C caused a downtick in an important r=
evenue stream for us.  The full impact of these events took time to reveal=
 itself. Meanwhile we continued to invest in improvements to our space=2C=
 team and curriculum.
The good news is that 3rd Ward has the potential to continue to grow and p=
rosper with an investment of capital=2C and  (http://www.3rdward.com/inves=
t) we=E2=80=99d like to invite our community to make an investment in 3rd=
 Ward and join us as shareholders (http://www.3rdward.com/invest) . 3rd Wa=
rd is asking for your immediate support.
There are two ways to participate: equity investment for the accredited in=
vestors amongst us=2C or the purchase of an =E2=80=9CI Love 3rd Ward=E2=80=
=9D gift card that will reward purchasers with a 25% bonus on all gift car=
d purchases=2C available for the next two weeks.
Never before have companies like ours been able to go directly to their co=
mmunity to seek investment.  However=2C new SEC guidelines that are a port=
ion of the JOBS Act that allows for the crowd funding of equity into compa=
nies went into effect on Monday=2C September 23rd. We'd like 3rd Ward to b=
e among the first companies to take advantage of this new opportunity. The=
 idea of equity crowd funding is about reinforcing the connections between=
 customers and the institutions they use.  We believe 3rd Ward is already=
 a center of gravity for its community=2C thus making us an ideal organiza=
tion to launch an equity crowd funding initiative.
3rd Ward has partnered with Fundrise.com (https://fundrise.com/pre-offerin=
g/3/view) as a platform to make this equity offer to the general public an=
d accredited investors. We plan to raise a minimum of $1.5 million=2C regi=
stration on Fundrise starts now. Sign up today and share with your network=
=2E
3rd Ward is an innovative place for entrepreneurs=2C freelancers=2C and en=
thusiasts to pursue their passions and projects. Perhaps you are a long ti=
me member=2C maker and student=2C or perhaps you have been an admirer from=
 afar enjoying our mission=2C values=2C and culture.  Either way=2C today=
 is an important time for you to get involved so that we can continue to b=
e a resource for all you makers out there now and into the future.
Warm Regards=2C
Jason Goodman
Founder and CEO
