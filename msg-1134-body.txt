Congress is boring.  The Judiciary Committee is holding a hearing on Stop =
Online Piracy Act as we write.  (You can watch it over here if that sort =
of thing gets you going.)

But if you'd rather have a smile on your face this afternoon, check out =
these new comics by the creator of Get Your War On -- and make a phone =
call to Congress.=20

David Rees walks us through the tragic-comedy that would come to pass if =
Hollywood and the big media conglomerates succeed at taking over the =
Internet.  Check it out:

http://www.getyourcensoron.com/



There's a good chance this committee hearing will run through tomorrow -- =
and some members have made it clear that they're still on the fence about =
SOPA.

You don't need to watch the hearing, but if you don't want the rest of =
life to be as boring as Congressional debates can be, you'd better check =
out our comics, make a call, and save the Internet.

Keep 'em coming.
