Hello, List!
Here are the listings as of Oct 22, 2014.


Listings Project Story of the Week:

Your list-service has been the most--and I say this without hyperbole--th=
e most successful, and crucial, way for us to get out the word about the =
Oracle Club. We are a membership based writers/artists club. We lean away=
 from any kinds of typical advertising, and are very much a word-of-mouth=
 based organization. If you were to ever walk by our place, you would see=
 a library from the street, and have very little idea what it is. And we =
like it this way. That said, it makes membership growth a very slow going=
 thing. I would say half of all our members found out about us through yo=
ur list. So thank you so much. I will continue to advertise with you, and=
 tell people what a great thing it is you have going. All the very best, =
Julian


Best,
Stephanie

Present Company (www.present-co.com) is an artist run gallery led by Chad=

 slop sinks, a bathroom, and small kitchenette (fridge, microwave, coffee=
 pot). There is a loading dock and direct access to the studio floor from=

hwick galleries including Signal which is 2 doors down. Present Company p=
resents 6 or so exhibitions a year along with many special events/screeni=
ngs/performances so there is always a lively atmosphere in the space.=20

Shares are fine. Longer leases (6 months to a year or longer) are preferr=
ed but we will consider short term. The space is currently under construc=
tion so I only have sketchup images and mid-work images. Studios should b=

$450.00 Per Month, Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, 450 sq. ft., Artist Studio: We Hav=
e Space In Our Basement
Available: Nov 01, 2014

Hi. I live in an apartment with a large, finished basement and have some =
extra space that I&#39;d like to rent to an artist who needs some space t=
o work. It is located in Bed-Stuy. There is potentially some sunlight fro=
m a door that opens to a skylight. The basement is the size of an entire =
floor of a brownstone, and I use about a third for my studio (I&#39;m pla=
y music). My roommate uses part of the basement for storage; that is the =
smaller area with the door to the skylight. Your space is a bit flexible;=
 right now it is just space and you can make of it what you want. It is a=
 bit oddly shaped because of the room for the boiler and furnace. In the =
pictures, the target area for your studio is marked by the mattress, whic=
h is going to be moved upstairs. You also have this L-shaped area that br=
eaks away from that space. The A/C train to Utica is about a ten minute w=
alk, and many busses run near by. It is about ten minutes from Williamsbu=
rg and Bushwick by bike. There is also on-street parking. This space is i=
ntended for artist use only, because we live here and that is what we fee=
l comfortable renting the space for. The rent is $450 + deposit, and the =
space is about 450 SF total. If this sounds like something you can work w=
ith, then please send me a note and tell me a bit about yourself. This ca=
n be a very good space for you.

$1,400.00 Per Month, Clinton Hill/Navy Yard, Brooklyn, Plenty Of Spaces A=
vailable In Beautiful Newly Renovated Bldg! Huge Range Of Sizes/Prices Av=
ailable!
Available: Aug 01, 2014

To anyone looking for a great new studio space to work in, I have been as=
ked to refer you to a new art studio project. I&#39;ve had my studio in t=
he same building for many years now, and it truly is a wonderful place to=
 work!=20

Because it&#39;s a brand new build out, there are many different spaces a=
vailable. The prices begin at $1025-$1350 for the medium-large ones. All =
have massive windows, and and are perfect size for sharing.

And then there are the truly enormous spaces with FAR more space and even=
 more windows. These range anywhere from $1400 - $4000.=20

Each space will have plenty of light and ventilation, as well as a heat a=
nd AC unit in every space. The building also provides gorgeous rooftop vi=
ews, 24 hour access and security, and an enormous loading dock and freigh=
t elevator.=20

For those not familiar with the area, it&#39;s generally thought of as a =
safe, quiet Brooklyn neighborhood. The building is just a few blocks from=
 the G train, with plenty of food options and easy street parking.

I have had my own art studio in this building for almost 4 years, and the=
 management has asked me to help get interest in the new spaces as they a=
re expanding the number of studios in the building. I will be the one sho=
wing the spaces and there are absolutely NO fees involved.

If you&#39;re interested, please text Jordan. I look forward to hearing f=
rom you. Thanks!

$935.00 Per Month, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, 1,000 sq. ft., Huge Greenpoint s=
tudio Share/Sublet
Available: Nov 01, 2014

I&#39;m looking to share/sublet my Greenpoint studio. In total the space =
is 1000 sq ft and includes both a slop sink and private bathroom. Largest=
 wall for working or presentation is approx 45 x 12 ft. and there&#39;s p=
lenty of open floorspace as well. Studio is on the 2nd floor of a small b=
uilding in the industrial east end of Greenpoint by the BQE.

Ideal candidate is a serious artist/craftsperson, who is clean-ish (or wi=
ll take preventative measures to contain their fury and/or maintain the i=
ntegrity of the space), and has basic common sense in regard to any toxic=
ity and/or flammability of the materials they are using and how they are =
disposed of (the ventilation options in the space proper are limited, but=
 there is roof access when the weather cooperates). I will be largely wor=
king on projects outside of the studio, so youre mostly going to be shari=
ng it with my storage. This is work only with 24/7 access, no living.

$935/month + 1 month deposit. Utilities (Gas in the winter, Electric in t=
he Summer) are reasonable and will be split 50/50.

$600.00 Per Month, East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 200 sq. ft., Art / Photo =
Studio Share
Available: Nov 01, 2014 through Aug 31, 2015

Hi,
I&#39;m looking for a studio-mate to share a 400 square foot second floor=
 artist space in East Williamsburg. I am a 26 year old video artist / pho=
tographer and have been working in New York for three years. The artist s=
tudio is about a 10 minute walk from the Grand St. L stop and 15 minutes =
to the Graham Ave stop. It is in an old brick industrial building and occ=
upied by artists of all sorts.

I have a job elsewhere, and will only be around the studio three or four =
days a week. It would be nice to find a like-minded artist who would be i=
nterested in doing similar things so that we can respect the space in the=
 same way. I often shoot tabletop stills, stop motion animation and edit.=
 It would also be good for food / product shoots, portraiture, and any ot=
her fine arts. I think it would be best to split the space in half (200sq=
 feet each), and if either of us requires more space, we can share the ce=
nter as needed. I also have an available desk if needed. Slop sink and ba=
throoms are around the corner. There is an accessible outdoor roof.

The rent is 1200 total, split to 600 each. Utilities are additional. Look=
ing for long someone dedicated to at least 6 months. Please email me if y=
ou have any questions, and if you&#39;re interested tell me a little abou=
t what you do and we can set up a time to meet.

Thanks!
Jackson

$144.00 Per Month, Gowanus, Brooklyn, 250 sq. ft., Big music rehearsal ro=
om, extra soundproofing, lots of storage
Available: Nov 01, 2014

We recently lost a tenant in our music rehearsal space in Gowanus and are=
 looking to replace his share of our large rehearsal room. If you&#39;ve =
taken a few tours of the typical Brooklyn rehearsal rooms, this will feel=
 pretty spacious even though it is shared with other bands.  The other te=
nants currently only use it a few evenings a week, so the daytimes are wi=
de open if you are looking for a project studio in the day, and if you ne=
ed nights, there are a few to choose from. Ideally, we&#39;re looking for=
 a solo project, but are open to discuss any potential occupant.  It&#39;=
s in a great facility with it&#39;s own lounge and stage area that tenant=
s can use to put on their own shows if that interests you. Let me know if=
 you have any questions!

$1,200.00 Per Month, Ridgewood, NY, Beautiful sunny room in new building!=

Available: Nov 01, 2014

Hello!

We have a beautiful sunny room available in our two bedroom apartment. Th=
e space has incredible high ceilings, big windows in all rooms and a grea=
t view. Sick of waiting for the shower in your current apartment?! Well y=
ou would have your own bathroom!! AND the bedrooms/bathrooms are on oppos=
ite sides of the apartment. In addition to all this, the building has a r=
oof deck with lounging furniture, a full gym, games rooms with TVs, and a=
 laundry room. =20

WE ARE a married couple who up until recently were living comfortably in =
this apartment with another couple. So much so that sometimes we would go=
 for days without seeing them. They had to move out unexpectedly and so w=
e are looking for someone pretty quickly.  I am an arts educator and jewe=
lry design assistant in my mid 20s and my husband is a bartender in his 3=
0s. We keep the house very clean and orderly, and we love to cook. We are=
 both usually around in the mornings and gone from afternoon till evening=
/night. We have a very fluffy black cat named fatsy who is more like a st=
uffed animal. We have nice plants and a comfortable kitchen for cooking. =
 My husband bar tends, but we are not big  partiers - you can usually fin=
d me  frantically working on some new project in my  room.=20

If all of this sounds good, or if you have additional  questions  please =
 don&#39;t hesitate to contact me!=20

Have a  great day!

$635.00 Per Month, Washington Heights, New York, NY, 77 sq. ft., Sunny 3 =
BR share in WaHi, $635 includes wifi
Available: Oct 01, 2014

Hi,  there are two rooms available in my 3 BR apartment in Washington Hei=
ghts.   The rooms are both around 7 x 11 each has a window and no closet.=
  One room comes with a twin bed and another has a bookshelf and small de=
sk.There is a decent size living room, bathroom and kitchen with a portab=
le clothes washer you are welcome to use. Apartment is on the second floo=
r. Both the rooms are renting out for $635, which includes wifi and heat.=
 electricity we split three ways when the bill comes, its about $30 per p=
erson. To move in I&#39;m asking for first and last months rent and a $20=
0 deposit. =20

The apartment is located in the sub-trendy area of Washington Heights on =
Audubon Ave near 178th St, with closest trains the 181st St 1 train and t=
he 175th St A train.  There are grocery stores within 1 block, Word Up Bo=
okstore is 10 blocks away and the awesome free summer outdoor pool is 5 b=
locks away.  Its a neighborhood of families so its safe, but beware, it c=
an also be noisy. =20

About me: I am a writer with a day job in another borough, and I am gone =
about 12 hours a day.  When I come home I like to make dinner, chill, may=
be watch one tv show (more on that below), and on weekends I like to go t=
o my writers space. =20

What I&#39;m looking for in a roommate: =20

You are a self-motivated cleaner.  Yes, I should come up with a cleaning =
schedule. If I don[t get it together to do that, you figure out that may=
be you should do something--anything.  I am in no way a neat freak, but c=
ommon spaces have to be kept in okay condition. When the floor looks dirt=
y I&#39;ll vacuum it, and if the bathroom looks gross I&#39;ll clean it, =
and I would do very well with someone who has the same spirit. I just ask=
ed a roommate to move out who never once in a year and a half cleaned any=
thing.  If you are a slob looking for cheap rent, please look elsewhere.

You don&#39;t smoke, have pets or do drugs. I am so sorry, but no smokers=
 who step outside.

You have a night and/or weekend job.  I confess I love coming home and ge=
tting some time to myself.  I will give preference to anyone who works an=
 opposite schedule than a 9-5.  When were sharing like this it makes ever=
ything really easy for all and there&#39;s never ever a wait for the bath=
room or kitchen. =20

Your mode of living doesn&#39;t involve coming home for the evening, turn=
ing on the TV and leaving it on until you go to bed, or you&#39;re going =
to sit in your room and watch Game of Thrones marathons on your tricked o=
ut stereo system. Yes to whatever your fave shows are, yes to a big boomy=
 movie now and then. =20

Yes yes yes to vegetarians.  Not a requirement, but a plus.

Yes to minimalists. You can&#39;t have a lot of belongings.  The living r=
oom and kitchen cannot accommodate any extra furniture. Sorry!

You pay bills on time and I don&#39;t have to remind you that rent is due=
. =20

If any of this appeals, please send me an email and tell me a little bit =
about yourself!

No pets
No couples
Available Nov 4

Welcome to Greenpoint. My home is a half block from the Greenpoint Ave G,=
 the B62 and B43 buses, and less than a 10 minute walk to a beautiful par=
k overlooking Manhattan and Greenpoint&#39;s Waterway ferry pier. Most im=
portantly, it&#39;s right up the street from Budin and Ovenly: Greenpoint=
&#39;s best coffee and cookies. Such a great hood.

I have a box apartment so there are 2 rooms total here. On entering, your=
 room is hidden by a line of golden curtains, (I cannot see you at all wh=
en I quietly come in to the apartment) and is connected to the back garde=
n. My room is down a short hall and a bathroom is between our spaces. It&=
#39;s so charming and private. All who have stayed here find it peaceful =
and like their own little cottage in Greenpoint. Furnished simply and wit=
h a lovely touch, you just need to bring your bag.

Why does it work? (a curtain instead of a wall?)
Well you have four walls; just one is a curtain! :)=20
Because I am barely there! And when I am, I really honor your space! I re=
ally like sharing my place because it&#39;s so cute and lovely. When it&#=
39;s not filled with an Airbnb-er, it&#39;s open for a NY-er to call home=
 for a bit. It&#39;s got good vibes. A little haven.

Your furnished room:
Super comfy futon bed, your own dresser, plus a coffee table. Mountain Va=
lley water, shower/sleep kit, snacks, neighborhood info, good vibes.

Email me with your dates; your background and work; and why you need a te=
mp space!

Welcome.=20

aded in the summer by trees. The apartment fire escape is off that window=
, and can be used for reading or alley cat watching during nice weather. =
It is a corner apartment and every room has windows. We have 12ft ceiling=
s which makes the whole apartment feel more spacious and airy. We have ce=
ntral heating, and dishwasher as added amenities. Rent is $800 w/o utilit=
ies - utilities run between $50-90 depending on the season. We will be si=
gning a new lease Nov. 1st, so you would be joining the new year lease. I=
t is 1st months rent, and a security of $575 to move in.=20

There are no images of the bedroom uploading to our listing because we re=
spect our current roommates privacy. If you are interested in becoming ou=
r roommate we can happily show you the room in person

The Neighborhood:
Our apartment is a 5 min walk from the Kingston 3, a 15 min walk to the T=
hroop/Kingston A/C, and a pleasant 15 min walk down Eastern Parkway to th=

About Us:
We are all 24, with steady jobs in the art and service industry. K is a b=
arista and artist assistant. N is an artist assistant. I (E) am a part-ti=
me gallery manager, and boutique sales associate. K and I share a room, a=
nd N is the other. We all have our BFA&#39;s and are all trying to figuri=
e out what how life, art, and a good nights sleep fit together. We enjoy =
a very relaxed, clean environment. Mon - Thur we are the early to bed, ea=
rly to rise types. A perfect night afterwork includes a large helping of =
apple pie &amp; ice cream, mixed with intellectual conversation and a das=
h of mind numbing pop culture. Oh &amp; cats! Well at least one cat, who =
is feisty, friendly and curious. Fri - Sun we like to go out and have fun=
. We don&#39;t host any ragers, we&#39;d rather go somewhere like the bar=
 and leave the mess there. Every once in a while we&#39;ll have a low key=
 dinner party - we all love to cook and regularly do house meals. We like=
 to hang out in the communal kitchen/livingroom, talk about something we =
heard on npr, complain about work, listen to music (Frank Ocean / Beyonce=
 / Taking Back Sunday / Bon Ivor / Chvrches / Lana Del Ray / Slayer - you=
 know the classics).=20

We are not open to bigotry, or closed mindedness. We are interested in le=
arning and growing from each other and with each other.=20

About You

Please tell us a bit about yourself. What you do for work? What do you li=
ke to do in your free time? What is your past communal living experience?=
 What do you look for in roommates?=20

*Our cat is very spoiled and would not work well additional friends. So, =
as much as we would love to meet you and your pet, if you have a furry fr=
iend it unfortunately wont work out.*

We look forward to hearing from you!

Best,
E, K, N

$1,250.00 Per Month, Park Slope, Brooklyn, 211 sq. ft., Huge room with pr=
ivate entrance across the street from the Park Slope Food Co-op
Available: Nov 01, 2014

We want to live with an excellent, sensational individual (or couple)!

The Room
- Rent: $1250/mo. ($1500 for a couple - $750 each)
- Utilities: $80/mo.
- 211 square feet  plenty of room for a couple
- 10-foot ceiling
- 2 tall, south-facing windows
- Hardwood floors
- Private entrance
- Lavish wall trimmings

The Roommates
We are two chill dudes in our late 20s and early 30s with strong ties to =
the west coast (Vancouver and L.A.). We like thoughtful, real conversatio=
ns; playing music; eating delicious food; and watching movies (we sometim=
es organize screenings in the back yard). We&#39;re into art and technolo=
gy, and using them to make the world a better place. We recycle and compo=
st. We both have tech-related day jobs, but we&#39;re artists at heart.

The Apartment
- 829 Union Street
- 1st floor apartment
- Private balcony overlooking the backyard (with plants and pretty white =
christmas lights and a BBQ)
- Park Slope brownstone full of wonderful people (musician friends on the=
 3rd floor)
- Backyard access
- Sizable living room and kitchen
- Tall showerhead
- Sweetest, most gentle landlord on the face of the planet (fixes stuff, =
is overwhelmingly kind and responsive)

The Neighborhood
...is about as hooked up as neighborhoods get  many, many amenities nearb=
y
- Two blocks away from Prospect Park and Grand Army Plaza
- Laundromat, Dixons Bike Shop, Park Slope Food Co-op, and the Tea Lounge=
 are all a stones throw from our doorstep
- 7-minute walk to the 7th ave B, Q
- 7-minute walk to the Grand Army Plaza 2, 3
- 7-minute walk to the Union Street R
- 15 minute walk to Atlantic Ave Terminal / Barclays Center
- Average 25-40 minute commute to Manhattan

You
Were looking for someone who...

- Is enthusiastic about creating a pleasant living space and culture
- Has a light in their eyes
- Is easygoing and relaxed, but respectful and considerate of other peopl=
es needs
- Likes to hang out / make art or cook or watch movies, but who is also i=
ndependent
- Is a good communicator (being on the same page really helps things)
- Is fun, creative, happy, smart, and cares about others

The Vibe
- We like the idea of making the space more beautiful and inspiring, so f=
eel free to customize, redecorate, or renovate
- Ali, the landlord, will usually cover materials for any renovation
- If something seems unfair or someone is unhappy with household issues, =
we bring it up and talk about it like adults. That might mean having a me=
eting to hash things out and get on the same page.

Cleanliness
Were laid back, but we like living in a clean space. It keeps us sane.
- Neither of us actually likes cleaning, but we make an effort out of res=
pect for each other and for the space. Its a golden rule kind of thing.
- We dont leave messes for other people to clean up
- We keep a bi-weekly cleaning schedule, which you must be willing to par=
take in
- Were not OCD about cleaning, but we dont do a crappy job, either. We do=
 a pretty decent job.
- Again, if issues arise, we communicate like adults and find a solution =
that works for everyone

ng Collective
Available: Nov 15, 2014

The Basics
Hi friends and potential future housemates! We are looking for roommates =
interested in joining a shared housing collective in central Brooklyn. We=
 enjoy creating a shared intentional space that supports creativity, pass=
ionate work, and a strong community. We have 2-3 slots available for a ne=
w shared house that will be ready for move-in for sometime between Novemb=
er 1-December 1st, with rooms ranging from $600-$1000/month plus utilitie=
s. We&#39;re excited for this new collective, and if this sounds like the=
 next place you&#39;d like to call home, keep reading below to find out m=
ore. If you&#39;d like to apply, please fill out our quick application th=
rough this google doc: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1WBKrRlbmRpCx330xp=
ZzN0v2I9idgz3P83QKqXgvDsBs/

Values
We are interested in intentional collective living, with a focus on foste=
ring an environment that is supportive of social justice, community build=
ing, and the arts. We respect people&#39;s needs for individual as well a=
s common space, and support creating designated shared resources as well =
as personal space and storage. This means you will have designated privat=
e space for food and personal belongings in the kitchen, as well as a des=
ignated space for resources that roommates would like to share with the h=
ouse. We enjoy and encourage informal shared meals and house activities a=
s time and schedules allow. Creating a positive living environment also r=
equires everyone to pitch in to keep the house clean, organized, and resp=
ectful. We especially value clear and honest communication, and creating =
a safe and relaxed home that feels like family.

The House:
We are looking to establish a house that will be ready for move-in on Nov=
.15- December 1st. Our required criteria include: It is a 6 bedroom, 3 ba=
th home in Kensington.

About the Roommates:
About Dave: A 27 year old educator working full time at the intersection =
of social work/education. The last several years I have spent heading out=
 with students to various places; Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, to the C=
atskill Mountains. Having led trips for half a decade, I am certainly a t=
raveler at heart, yet also someone who loves to slowly roam the city stre=
ets. Being a native New Yorker, this can seem a bit out of whack. I reall=
y do try and bring back what I love about being away in far away lands to=
 my life here in NYC. I love to be in green space; bike, hike, and connec=
ting with friends over some good music as much as I love a relaxed night =
of eating and talking around a small kitchen table. I am serious and pass=
ionate about work and my relationships but hardly take myself too serious=
ly. I&#39;m a big supporter of the occasional costume and a good long nap=
 in a hammock.

About Andrea: I&#39;m 28 years old. Originally I&#39;m from Colorado and =
moved to the east coast 10 years ago for college. I&#39;ve since worked f=
or a medical university, on an organic farm, for a music venue, and parti=
cipated in an AmeriCorps Public Allies program. I like experiencing and l=
earning about new cultures, people, and places. I currently work remotely=
 for a CT-based nonprofit specializing in affordable housing and work in =
project management and grants administration. I&#39;m also a lifelong mus=
ician and play fiddle, sing, and write for a Brooklyn based string band. =
I help lead American roots music workshops for elementary through high sc=
hool students.=20

About You:
We are looking for housemates who are interested in collective living, wh=
o respect others, enjoy shared spaces, and are friendly and with a good s=
ense of humor. Do you value open communication and a mutual generosity of=
 time, energy, work, and friendship? A house filled with plants? If so, t=
his may be the place for you!

Room available in great, recently remodeled apartment in the heart of Bus=

work long hours. When I&#39;m home, I&#39;m there to relax and keep prett=

About Your Future Roommate:

Addie works in Social Media for an ad agency and keeps regular hours. She=
 loves snacking on plates of fancy or not so fancy cheeses while watching=
 TV shows she is too embarrassed to list here. She is very clean and has =
no qualms about scrubbing a toilet provided we take turns. She thinks hom=
e is a quiet escape where you go to be alone and unwind, not necessarily =
a place to host a party (although the occasional dinner with friends does=
 happen.) Addie will stop talking in third person now because it&#39;s ge=
tting weird.

About You:

You are in your mid 20&#39;s to early 30&#39;s, female and work regular h=
ours.=20
You prefer to go out rather than bring the hoopla home
You value having a quiet, clean place to come back to at the end of a lon=
g day
You are considerate and reasonable when using common areas
You don&#39;t smoke or do drugs
Bonus: You also like to eat fancy and not so fancy cheeses while watching=
 terrible TV (ideal night scenario type of deal.)

$2,600.00 Per Month, Bushwick, Brooklyn, 1000 sq. ft., Gorgeous Loft Apar=
tment - Help a MacDowell Fellow
Available: Nov 25, 2014 through Jan 31, 2015

My apartment is a huge, high-ceilinged loft in Bushwick. I&#39;m leaving =
for two months to do a residency at the MacDowell Colony (Yay!). The spac=
e is absolutely gorgeous, as you can see from the photos, and has views o=
f the Manhattan skyline, a lofted bed (an uber-comfortable Keetsa), and a=
 super comfortable new couch from Restoration Hardware (the photos were t=
aken before the couch was there, so you have to trust me). There&#39;s al=
so a projector, so you can watch big-screen movies while sitting on the c=
omfy couch, which is amazing. The apartment is in a building called &quot=
;The Loom,&quot; which has an upscale coffee shop (Kave) with an outdoor =
patio, a yoga studio, a laundry room, a shipping center, and a bunch of c=
ute stores you can visit without even going outside. It&#39;s also close =
to tons of great bars and restaurants, such as the famous Roberta&#39;s, =
Dear Bushwick, and Momo Sushi. Yum!

The rent I&#39;m charging is exactly what I pay. I&#39;ll also need half =
a month&#39;s rent for a deposit, for the sake of the lovely couch, but I=
&#39;ll cover utilities. Contact if you want more pictures! I&#39;ve got =
tons! : )

$3,200.00 Per Month, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 750 sq. ft., Cozy Williamsbu=
rg Loft
Available: Nov 01, 2014 through Sept 01, 2015

The Space

Old warehouse loft by the waterfront in South Williamsburg. One big open =
space with exposed brick and wood floors throughout, and windows on two s=
ides. It&#39;s a corner unit with lots of natural light. Wood floors span=
 most of the apartment, but there is tile in the kitchen and bathroom. Co=
ok in a spacious kitchen area with tons of counter space and a gas range.=
 Bathroom also has exposed brick, and a shower/tub combo.=20

Almost directly under the Williamsburg bridge, this early century buildin=
g houses just over 30 units, and this is one of the best in the building.=
 Space is comfortable and quiet most of the time. The view is decent, wit=
h partial views of the Williamsburg bridge and some neighboring warehouse=
-y like buildings.=20

The neighborhood is great - far enough away from the maddening heart of W=
illiamsburg on the charming, and more relaxed, south side. Diner, Bia, Mi=
ss Favela, Aurora, 1or8, Crown Victoria. There&#39;s tons of great option=
s this side of metropolitan.

-10 minute walk to M-J-Z subway line=20
-15 minute walk to L subway (direct to East Village/Manhattan)=20
- Taxi&#39;s are plentiful, but the neighborhood is also serviced by Uber=
 and NorthSide car service. Also, CitiBike is right around the corner and=
 the entire neighborhood is equipped with bike lanes.

It&#39;s the perfect apartment for a couple or a single person who want s=
ome loft-y charm in a great location.

I am a current tenant at this space and have been for two years. I am fav=
ored by the landlords and am offering a sublease to this unit, as I am mo=
ving in with my fiance. I am not a broker. I am posting this for myself. =
The management company will definitely have to approve the paperwork of a=
ny potential tenant, and it is standard NYC paperwork - ie credit check, =
letter of employment or other income verification, etc.

I will be happy to show the place myself. The only fees i know of are the=
 credit check (maybe $100) and then it&#39;s a one month security deposit=
 and that&#39;s about it.

the discounted weekly sublet rate. We have a neutered, 60lb, Australian C=
attle Dog named Darby who is high energy and high intelligence. The best =
situation for him is to have someone live here for a couple weeks beforeh=
and and get to know him, before being responsible for taking care of him =
while we are away. Taking care of him would mostly involve a 30-60 minute=
 walk in the morning, a bathroom break in the afternoon, and another a 60=
 minute walk in the evening. Experience with energetic dogs is a must.

Aside from the Chritsmas to New Year&#39;s period, you&#39;d be sharing t=
he apartment with us. We are easy going high school teachers that like to=
 relax at home in the evenings, cook dinner, and listen to records or wat=
ch a movie. The apartment is fully furnished and comfortable. The actual =
room we are subletting is about 8 feet by 12 feet, and has a large window=
, a full size bed, a desk, and storage space for clothes. There are groce=
ries, fast food, and a couple of bars and restaurants in the vicinity, an=
d the J train is just half a block away for easy access to Williamsburg a=
nd Manhattan (15-20 minutes).

I am the owner, live on site, and my wife or I will be showing the space.=

No brokers, no fees. I will need cash up front and a valid ID.

If you choose to contact us, please tell us a little about yourself, why =
you are in New York, and what experience you have taking care of dogs. Th=
ank you for looking. Alan, Sophie, and Darby.

7 Cross Street, Saugerties, NY, 12477

Four small warehouse buildings commercially zoned in the Village of Sauge=
rties.
about 2 hours from NYC, right off the thruway.

the property is in disrepair- however has a strong foundation and amazing=
 potential.

This is being sold as one lot- but great for a group of artists.
This is my late fathers &#39;s property. he was an artist. He lived and w=
orked there. As well, he had a gallery for a time in one of the buildings=


One drawback is the parking situation. There is a lot adjacent to the pro=
perty, that was my father&#39;s, but you would have to acquire from  the =
county for about 8k.

$1,400.00 Per Month, Brooklyn or Manhattan, New York, 27yr old Urban Desi=
gner from Omaha
Available: Nov 01, 2014

My name is David, I&#39;m a 27 straight male omnivore. I work as an urban=
 designer at a nonprofit design firm in Manhattan (been there for 2.5 yea=
rs, $55k salary). Ideally, I&#39;m looking to move into a new place by No=
v 1st, but I can sublet a friend&#39;s place for about a month so I can b=
e flexible on dates.

I enjoy gardening (basil, lavender, rosemary, tomatoes, peppers, marigold=
s, etc.), cycling, going on crazy long walks, the Rockaways, classic amus=
ement parks, Photoshop, reading, and listening to Saddle Creek bands. I&#=
39;m very liberal in my politics (and friendly to all orientations), but =
also have a pretty live-and-let-live attitude about the beliefs of others=
. Also, I&#39;m near-nuerautically clean, so no messy spaces.

I eat at a lot of diners; counter seating and breakfast all day are the b=
est. I cook mostly vegan/vegetarian at home and I&#39;m fine with a meat-=
free apt. I have a lot of kitchenwares and a wire rack which is great for=
 storage. Also, I travel a lot for work and pleasure (just in the last mo=
nth I&#39;ve been to Denmark, Sweden, Pennsylvania, Montana, and Colorado=
). About once every month or so, I end up having a friend come visit for =
the weekend, so being able to have occasional guests is a must.

Originally from Omaha, Nebraska and Lawrence, Kansas, I&#39;ve lived in t=
he city for almost three years and had two years of grad school at Rutger=
s before that, so I have a solid group of friends here. I&#39;ve lived in=
 BedStuy and Williamsburg, but I&#39;m really familiar with most of Brook=
lyn (my best friend lives in Kensington) and Manhattan (my sister lives i=
n LES). You can check out my Facebook page if you want: https://www.faceb=
ook.com/dmnoma (the cover photo is my dad at Fort Tilden).

As far as units, I prefer a lot of sunlight (east-facing windows ideally)=
 and 2nd floor or higher. Price-wise, I&#39;d rather not pay more than $1=
400, but for the right space would consider it. I&#39;ve had both male an=
d female roommates since I was 14 (boarding school), and I prefer a gende=
r mixed place, but I&#39;m fine with all male or all female too.

$900.00 Per Month, Greenpoint &amp; Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Seeking Comfy=
 Room
Available: Nov 01, 2014

Hi All!

I&#39;m looking to move into a comfy room that offers privacy, sunlight (=
big plus!) and a good homey atmosphere.  I currently live in Greenpoint (=
corner of Franklin and Greenpoint Ave) and absolutely adore the area. Ive=
 lived in my current place for 8 months and I am ready for a change.

About me: I&#39;m a 29 year old female originally from Lafayette, LA. I m=
oved here from Houston, TX.  Truly a Cajun southern gal who is quiet and =
respectful of others. I clean up after myself and I am considerate. I enj=
oy yoga, food (I&#39;m from Louisiana after all!), movies, music and grea=
t drinks with friends.  I typically do my partying outside of where I liv=
e instead of bringing the craziness home.=20
=20
When I come home I love to relax. I like to read, enjoy a glass of wine, =
watch Netflix and unwind. I don&#39;t do much cooking.

I work in both Manhattan and Brooklyn as a personal assistant. I&#39;m al=
so a Life Coach on the side.  I practice yoga in Manhattan on weekday mor=
nings and work at my yoga studio on Wednesday evenings.=20

I don&#39;t have any pets but I love, love, love cats:) I dont smoke.

I&#39;d love to find the right match so feel free to email me with any qu=
estions or reach out if you think we&#39;re a good fit as roomies...

$1,000.00 Per Month, Williamsburg, Park Slope,Cobble Hill, etc, Brooklyn,=
 NY, Teeny sq. ft., Creative, supercool British woman for a happy home
Available: Oct 22, 2014 through Apr 01, 2015

Did you say comfortable, cozy, and feels like home?! I&#39;d love to live=
 somewhere wonderful in Williamsburg or Park Slope with a lovely roommate=
 (or three.)

Give me a tiny cupboard to live in, that&#39;s okay! (Although if you hav=
e a decent size room, all the better, of course). But more than anything,=
 give me a room in a great location that&#39;s affordable and with great =
people. $800 would be amazing, but if I need to stretch to $1000 for the =
right place, I&#39;ll do it.

I do two different things: music and food.

As a musician I&#39;ve toured and recorded with the Smashing Pumpkins, an=
d lots of your favourite bands, playing strings etc.

http://ilovestrings.com/about-ysanne/

I compose music, and I work for a music management /record company /radio=
 station that&#39;s based out of the UK and is now setting up a studio in=
 Williamsburg.=20

http://amazingradio.com/

I also write cookbooks on the side, and I throw supperclubs like this...

http://kindelish.com/

My next cookbook will be published by Rizzoli in Spring, and we&#39;re do=
ing the press launch in November, so it&#39;s a busy time. And pretty muc=
h it&#39;s always is a busy time, because I love creating, and love worki=
ng on everything I do. It&#39;s like I work all the time, and never work,=
 because doing what you love is like that, especially juggling two differ=
ent things.=20

I&#39;m a great roommate! I mean, I write cookbooks, so I cook and love t=
o share! And I get plus ones to see great shows! And I enjoy living with =
people, in a gentle way, with lots of space, but also good quality late n=
ights and mornings with coffee, and generally caring for the people I liv=
e with and being a friendly face to listen to how your day was. I love pe=
ople, and I also love and respect personal space.

I&#39;ve lived in many different spots in NY and LA... I was born and rai=
sed in London, but I&#39;ve been in the States for 10 years. I do my dish=
es etc and am clean and neat, but not too clean or neat. Just right. I&#3=
9;ve lived on my own, lived with roommates in NYC, LA, Tokyo and London, =
and even in a community of 13 people in Silverlake with two bathrooms! Ye=
s, and everything in between.=20

My last place was in the Lower East Side. I lived in the spare room, wher=
e the main tenants were a married couple, and it worked great during the =
6-months was had the sublet, also found on Listings Project. They can pro=
vide references if you&#39;d like them to, also their dog is a big fan of=
 me due to the fact that I&#39;d cover dog duty for the couple when they =
traveled.

I have two Instagrams: one for music, one for food:

http://instagram.com/ilovestrings/
http://instagram.com/kindelishnyc/

I&#39;m looking for a home where I can relax, create, develop a friendshi=
p, and chill. Somewhere with a kind person who is busy and active and cre=
ative, and generally on the same wavelength. I don&#39;t care what your j=
ob is, but I do care that we&#39;ll be very comfortable with each other, =
and that we can say stuff and cook stuff and just have a nice time over t=
his coming winter, at least until spring.

Feel free to ask me anything, text, email, call... and I&#39;m able to mo=
ve as soon as you&#39;d like, preferably immediately, but could be as lon=
g as December 1st. Flexible for the right place!

<span>=20
Your list-service has been the most--and I say this without hyperbole--th=
e most successful, and crucial, way for us to get out the word about the =
Oracle Club. We are a membership based writers/artists club. We lean away=
 from any kinds of typical advertising, and are very much a word-of-mouth=
 based organization. If you were to ever walk by our place, you would see=
 a library from the street, and have very little idea what it is. And we =
like it this way. That said, it makes membership growth a very slow going=
 thing. I would say half of all our members found out about us through yo=
ur list. So thank you so much. I will continue to advertise with you, and=
 tell people what a great thing it is you have going. All the very best, =
