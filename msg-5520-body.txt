Label News

Hi everyone and welcome to the Sorry State update for January! Things
continue to be relatively quiet on the label front, but we do have a
new release planned for January: the second Brain F=E2=89=A0 LP, Empty =
Set,
should finally be out this month! We just finally finished the artwork
and the vinyl has been pressed already, so barring an last-minute
weirdness this should be available for you to order in the next couple
of weeks. I couldn't be more excited about this record... I like it
even more than their great first LP. Watch your favorite web sites for
some preview streams over the next couple of weeks, as Alex at Grave
Mistake (with whom I'm co-releasing the record) and I are keeping this
one close to our chests until the release date.

After that the only release with solid plans is the new Dark Ages LP.
I've heard some rough mixes and they already sound astounding...
there's definitely a progression from the first LP as the band has
mixed in some brooding sounds with their lightning-fast hardcore. I'm
not sure when this'll be done with mixing, but I'm guessing it should
be out sometime in early spring.

As I mentioned before, the label will be quiet for a bit after that as
we continue running the store and the distro, but a few Sorry State
bands have new records in the works so don't think we're anywhere near
done yet.

Jeff's Update

Hey everyone!  So I always feel like I'm terrible at doing these "Top
10s of the year things" because I know I'm probably forgetting
something or that it's too obvious, but here's just a quick list of
records I thought were really good this past year in no particular
order:

1. Infern=C3=B6h - 7 Sp=C3=A5r EP
2. Framtid - Defeat of Civilization
3. Sickoids - No Home
4. Manipulation - Manipulation LP
5. Criaturas - Espiritu De Libertad
6. Pleasure Leftists - Pleasure Leftists LP
7. Padkarosda - Szabadul=C3=A1som M=C5=B1v=C3=A9szete
8. Green Beret - Cult of State EP
9. Radioactivity - Radioactivity LP
10. Die - S/T EP

So there it is, short and sweet.  I'm really looking forward to 2014
being another awesome year for Sorry State.  Thanks for reading!

-Jeff

Seth's Update

I'm not much for end of the year lists.  I can't remember what came
out last month much less 11 months ago. I know any attempt to make one
would end up with endless revising and going through my records over
and over trying to remember what came out this year and then
overlooking a million things I would like to put in.  Anyways my list
would probably just end up saying Love Triangle ten times.  But yeah
2013 was another year with plenty of good albums and great shows.
It's gone though and no list will bring it back.  Instead I'm looking
forward to this new year and new month.  There are a handful of great
shows coming up in the Raleigh area this month.  Also there's lots of
new Raleigh/ NC bands playing these shows.  I'm excited to see Skemata
and Vacant Planet who are two new bands from around.  Then after a
month or so off both Black Zinfandel and No Love will be back to
playing shows, writing songs, and hopefully recording.  That's all
about I have for this month.  I promise next month to actually talk
about records.

Daniel's Update

In case you haven't noticed yet, the theme of this month's update is
the year-end list, so here's mine. There are a bunch of rad things
like the Arms Race demo and Glue demo 7" that I haven't really had a
chance to digest yet, but would probably get on this list if I made it
in a month, but for now I'll stick to my most-listened to 2013
releases. By the way, this excludes all Sorry State stuff (and I
released some BANGERS this year if I do say so myself), and is in no
particular order:

Nemesis: Gyou-Shou 7"
Radioactivity: S/T 12"
Avon Ladies: 2nd 7"
Violent Future: S/T 7"
Sauna Youth: False Jesii b/w Oh Joel 7"
Stoic Violence: S/T 12"
Parquet Courts: Light Up Gold 12"
Sad Boys: S/T and Pogo and Cry 7"s
Hoax: S/T 12"
Pleasure Leftists: S/T 12"
Various: Ground Zero Hardcore 12"
Kremlin: Drunk in the Gulag 12"
Church Whip: Psychedelic Nightmare 12"
Gag: This Punk Shit Is Cool... 12"
Gas Rag: Human Rights 7"
Quango: Fatality 7"
Sucked Dry: Dog Children 12"
The Repos: Poison Head cassette and Live Munitions 12"
Proxy: Something We've All Seen Before 12" and Police Car 7"
Impalers: S/T 12"
Lumpy & the Dumpers: S/T 7"
Merchandise: BBC Sessions 12"

As you can see, it was impossible to limit myself to just 10 records,
and there are so many more great ones that I didn't even mention. 2013
ruled!

Oh, and in case you're wondering here are the top 10 distro sellers
for December... I wish I had data for all of 2013, but it would be too
difficult since I changed webstores in September. Maybe next year
though!

1. Libyans: Expired Language 12"
2. Nemesis: Gyou-Shou 7"
3. Mercy Killings: S/T 7"
4. Creep: Creep Tape cassette
5. Joint D=E2=89=A0: Satan Is Real Again, Again... 12"
6. Deep Wound: S/T 7"
7. Glue: demo 7"
8. The Love Triangle: Clever Clever 12"
9. Secret Prostitutes: Welcome to Punk 12"
10. Lost Kids: Cola Freaks 7"

Featured Distro Items

Savage Amused: demo 12" (Mind Cure)
Reissue of the surviving recordings by this early Pittsburgh hardcore
band. Though they were around in 1985, they don't really sound
anything like the crossover that was popular at the time. Really, they
almost sound like a lost relic of proto-hardcore... I'm reminded a lot
of the gnarliest Cleveland punk bands like the Pagans or a faster Dead
Boys. In other words, it's fast and extremely tough, but also quite
catchy. Fans of similarly tough punk bands like Battalion of Saints or
Toxic Reason take note... this is a real undiscovered gem.

Deafheaven: Sunbather 12" (Death Wish)
Vinyl issue for one of the most talked-about releases of the year,
metal or otherwise. With Sunbather, Deafheaven have created one of
those releases that is so strikingly original and singular that it's
almost difficult to wrap my mind around. Taking up where, say, Liturgy
left off, Deafheaven infuse the raw black metal template with more
melody than I would have really thought possible... and they're
dreamy, spacey melodies at that. Try your best to imagine Darkthrone
playing Sunny Day Real Estate or My Bloody Valentine covers and that
will get you somewhere in the ballpark of what this sounds like, but
really it's its own thing.

Doses: S/T 12" (Going Underground)
LA's Doses follow up their excellent Live in Waco, Texas tape with
this monstrous debut LP. On the live tape they sounded more like
hardcore with a drum machine (they did cover Cro-Mags on that tape
after all), but their noise rock influences are closer to the fore on
this LP. The band do a really great job of fusing off-kilter heaviness
with the subtle catchiness that made bands like Unsane great... these
are songs, but they're ugly, uncomfortable songs. A really striking
and powerful LP.

Cro-Mags: Age of Quarrel 12" (Brass City Boss Sounds)
Straight reissue of one of the greatest hardcore records of all time.
Age of Quarrel is sort of like the Reign in Blood of tough hardcore...
if you have only one record in your collection that you could
reasonably mosh to, then Age of Quarrel should probably be it. This
reissue pretty much perfectly replicates the original's packaging and
sound... 100% essential.

Glue: Demo 7" (Lagerville)
Vinyl issue for one of those most talked-about hardcore demos of
2013. After one of the most epic hardcore intros I've heard in some
time (and one worth of the band name's SSD reference), this launches
into some absolutely scorching hardcore punk. I could describe the
sound of this, which is pretty much pure 80s hardcore with snotty vox
a la Gordon Solie Motherfuckers, but really what makes this demo stand
out is the songwriting. The band have a way of varying the tempos and
the riffing in a way that really keeps you on your toes and just
constantly wanting more. Easily one of the best-written and funnest
hardcore demos since the Boston Strangler. Highly recommended.

Jimmy Smack: Death Rocks 7" (Death Vault)
Archival release of this obscure early 80s California synth punk
project. Apparently Jimmy Smack shared bills with numerous bands from
the early LA hardcore scene royalty, but this is the first I've heard
of him... this some great, dark, minimal synth-punk in the Screamers
vein though. It seems like synth bands from this era often come from
the Human League end of things, but Jimmy Smack is pure dark punk...
really sinister-sounding, and if you're a fan of the Screamers or the
Normal you will definitely flip for this. Really killer.

Bad People: Mean Talkin' 7" (Feeble Minds)
Following quickly on the heels of their debut, here's the 2nd 7" from
Buffalo's Bad People. As I noted in the description of their 1st EP,
this band is ex-Brown Sugar and definitely has a lot of that band's
off-kilter hardcore punk in their DNA; however, particularly on this
EP Bad People are even catchier and more punk-sounding. The helium
vocals recall the Dickies or numerous Killed by Death-type bands, but
the tight, fast, and catchy playing makes me think of something more
like Rhino 39... definitely one of my favorite current bands, and this
new record is even more highly recommended than their first.

Generacion Suicida / Catholic Spit: Split 7" (MMM)
Two new songs from Generacion Suicida featuring their patented
Vicious / Masshysteri-style punk... catchy, fast, raw and melodic. As
for Catholic Spit, they're a little more straightforwardly post-punk,
but their contribution is much more upbeat and fun than a lot of the
Siouxsie-inspired stuff I've heard lately. Yeah, there's lots of
chorus on the guitar, but the inspiration seems to be more stuff like
Legal Weapon and very early Christian Death (but even faster). Overall
a solid split 7" from two of California's most talked-about punk
bands.

Permanent Ruin: Mas Alla de la Muerte 7" (Warthog Speak)
Brand new EP from this NorCal hardcore band featuring Mariam from
Condenada on vocals. I've heard Permanent Ruin described as having a
power violence influence and I guess that's true (there's a brief
blast break at the beginning of "Solution"), but like my favorite
bands who get described as power violence, this sounds more like
straightforward hardcore played super, super fast and angry. In other
words, it's fast, but the changes from fast to mid-paced parts don't
feel gimmicky or overwrought. Definitely one of the tightest, angriest
bands out right now... recommended.

Mayday!: S/T 7" (self-released)
New 7" from this band from upstate NY who had a split 7" with Brown
Sugar. I don't know what it is, but bands from this area (I'm thinking
specifically of Skate Korpse and Insubordinates) have this perfect,
slightly weird combination of surf and punk... it's kind of like early
Agent Orange, but really it's its own thing and a sound that is very
much native to that particular region. Mayday are definitely in that
vein, and if you dig the more original and interesting strands of
music coming out of this region you should definitely check out this
EP.

Eel: Turn Up Fuck 7" (Mind Cure)
Debut EP from this new band of Pittsburgh miscreants. I caught their
promo video online a few weeks ago and they had a very kind of
neo-noise punk sound a la Vaginors, but the recording on this EP is
much uglier, nastier, and harder. It really does sound like first-gen
Kyushu noisecore, Gai in particularly. It has the same bouncy bass,
incredibly ugly vocals and the guitar isn't quite distorted into the
realm of utter stupidity. This thing is super super limited and I
believe already sold out from the label, so grab it now if you want
it.

Koward: S/T 7" (Total Fucker)
New EP from this new Boston d-beat band (or maybe they're split
between Boston and Portland?). This is some stomping, catchy d-beat...
it's vaguely in the same universe as Framtid, but something about it
is a little less brutal and a little more punk, but just as heavy and
tough. Definitely one of the standout d-beat records I've heard of
late.

Arm's Race: demo cassette (Flophouse)
US pressing of the demo from this new London band featuring members
of Stab. While Stab are all about the Heresy / Ripcord sound, Arm's
Race are a much nastier, more brutal, early 80s-sounding band. There's
still that hint of metal to the riffing, but really this is nearly a
dead ringer for early Agnostic Front in places... almost like it's
some long-lost demo from between United Blood and Victim in Pain.
Absolutely essential... highest possible recommendation.

Public Suicide: demo cassette (Flophouse)
Another in the new wave of one-man straight edge bands sweeping the
nation. This one is out of DC and definitely a bit on the harder end
of things. While it's speedy and snappy like early 80s hardcore,
there's a meatiness to the riffing that belies an influence from early
Madball and the type of NYHC bands that appeared on the New Breed
compilation. Fast, tight, and extremely well-executed.

Komplott: Sei Vivo cassette (Flophouse)
Cassette release from this new Italian band featuring members of
Holy... total pile-driving d-beat in the Framtid tradition. Just
gnarly, Discharge-inspired riffs delivered with maximum power and
catchiness.

Obstruct: No Life + Demo cassette (Flophouse)
Cassette release featuring the debut EP and demo from this UK
straight edge band. Definitely more in the No Tolerance / modern
Boston school of sxe HC, this is heavy, bulldozer stuff that packs
quite a punch. UKHC has been killing it lately and it's great to see
that the scene has some depth to it. Highly recommended if you're
interested in No Tolerance, Violent Reaction, or modern sxe HC with an
early 80s slant check this out.

Aube: demo cassette (self-released)
Demo tape from this Ottawa post-punk band. This has the heavy reverb
and chorus that you expect from the genre, but also has a kind of
snotty punk vibe that I don't generally associate with this dense
post-punk sound. You can tell Bauhaus is a major influence, but the
more punk vocals definitely give it a little something that it
wouldn't have otherwise. A solid entry into the canon of modern
post-punk.

No Negative: Album Blanc cassette (self-released)
Another Canadian post-punk demo, and it's another gem. You get some
heavily chorus-ed out guitar, propulsive punk rhythms and a powerful
rhythm section. This actually reminds me a little bit of Beastmilk in
that the songs are extraordinarily well written, but the delivery is a
lot scrappier, more DIY and more punk. Definitely one of the best
post-punk-type things I've heard in ages.

Heron: Ritual cassette (self-released)
Debut EP from this North Carolina black metal band. While the base
here is definitely classic-sounding black metal with haunting
keyboards, there are some really interesting kind of progressive
breaks that give this a really unique feel. Beautiful recording and
powerful, atmospheric songwriting.

Sperm: demo cassette (self-released)
Demo tape from this new NY band featuring Josh from Shoppers / Bad
People. I'm not really sure if the band were going for this at all,
but the similarities to Broken Prayer are really striking. Like BP,
nearly every song here is different from the last. There are some kind
of brooding post-punk songs, some quirky midwest-style HC a la Die
Kreuzen, and some stuff that just sounds like straightforward punk.
All of it is raw, powerful, and interesting... if you're into
forward-thinking punk and hardcore I highly recommend this one.

Vaccine / No Faith: Split 7" (Vinyl Rites)
Brand new split 7" from these two Massachusetts straight edge bands.
No Faith follow up their LP on Painkiller with more of their crushing
sound... all you get is slow here... no go at all, but it's noisy and
angry as hell. As for Vaccine, these are their final tracks and
they're right in line with their earlier stuff... almost impossibly
fast and vicious straight edge hardcore with just ridiculous tempo
changes and arrangements. Fans of Infest could definitely get down
with this, but I wouldn't call it power violence as such... just super
fast and mean hardcore.

The Insults: Population Zero 7" (Last Laugh)
You may know "Population Zero" from its inclusion on Killed by Death
#8 1/2, and it's a great slice of minimal, UK-influenced KBD punk...
it's got the loose, rawness of the best KBD stuff, but something about
the driving, almost rockabilly-ish bass line reminds me of UK stuff,
maybe even the early Fall? As for the flip, it's very much in the same
vein with a fast tempo, high guitars and rumbling bass... in a way it
reminds me of the Warsaw stuff, but not quite as dark. This is
definitely all you want from a KBD reissue, so don't sleep!

Sick Thoughts: Terminal Teen Age 12" (Dead Beat)
Debut LP from this one man band out of Baltimore who clearly worships
at the altar of Jay Reatard. Their earlier 7" on Can't Stand Ya!
really blew me away with their big garage hooks, but the LP is a
little more Reatards and a little less Jay Solo... in other words, the
hooks are a little more buried and the recording is super blown out,
approaching total fuzz in the bottom end. Still, there's plenty of
killer riffs and tracks here, and if you want to hear some strong
Reatards worship you'll flip for this.

The Kurws: Hole in the Ghetto 12" (Bat Shit)
US version of this Polish band's debut LP. Something a little bit
different for Bat Shit, this is an all-instrumental band that plays
hyperactive, skronky stuff... sort of like the Minutement or the
Urinals at their most abstract moments, but even at time approaching
the dizziness of the Residents. Rad artwork on this bad boy too.

Vermaio: MMDF 7" (Bat Shit)
Debut 7" by this new Italian project featuring two of the guys from
Fogna. It's a bit more straightforward and punk than Fogna... it still
has that distinct Rudimentary Peni influence, but it also reminds me a
lot of both classic Mexican hardcore and newer stuff like Inservibles.
At any rate, it's incredibly mean, nasty and ugly... great stuff, just
as good if not better than Fogna.

Fogna: S/T 7" (Bat Shit)
Repress of the super limited debut EP by this Italian HC project.
Deep, dark Rudimentary Peni vibes here... this music is dense, laden
with feedback and dark as hell, but it also has the catchiness of Rudi
P as well. In an interesting decision, this is recorded with a drum
machine rather than a live drummer, and it really lends itself to the
cold, desolate feel that the music has. A total stand-out, and highly
recommneded.

Spasma: Mediocrazia 7" (Bat Shit)
Yet another Fogna-related side project from Bat Shit Records, though
this one is a little different. While most of this crew's stuff tends
to be marked by a heavy Rudimentary Peni influence (or at least what
sounds like it to me), Spasma are much more straightforward, with a
recording that very strongly recalls Poison Idea's classic Darby Crash
Rides Again, perhaps mixed with some nasty early European hardcore
like Agent Orange or Wretched. Regardless, this has absolutely perfect
early 80s-sounding analog production and the songwriting is flat-out
ripping from top to bottom... can't recommend this one highly enough.

Kaivosurma: Lootin Vaimo 7" (Bat Shit)
New EP by this blazing Finnish HC band... angry, straightforward
stuff without a lot of the frills and complex musicianship of, say,
Sokea Piste, but instead focusing on maximum rage. Consider this in
the tradition of classics like Lama and newer stuff like Kieltolaki. I
dig the super weird cover artwork too.

Pierre and Bastien: Cancer 7" (Bat Shit)
New 7" from this Parisian band. This is catchy, poppy stuff that
reminds me a lot of the stuff coming out of Copenhagen a few years
ago... it bears more than a passing resemblance to Gorilla Angreb (no
lady vox though) as well as that great Peter Bonneman solo single that
not a lot of people heard. In other words, this is fast and punk, but
also super catchy and with something about it that feels vaguely
progressive and post-punk. In a way it sounds like an early Rough
Trade single, but without any sort of pretensions to recreating that
style at all... it's just two great catchy, punk songs with awesome
DIY production.

His Electro Blue Voice: White Wall 7" (Bat Shit)
Brand new EP from this Italian noise / post-punk band whose latest LP
was released on Sub Pop(?!?). It's easy to see why, because this band
can write a freaking hook. Yeah, it's bathed in lots of that My Bloody
Valentine-influenced reverb and distortion, but so many bands recreate
this sound without the great songwriting. Not HEBV, though... this guy
can write a tune, and the two songs here are catchy, beautiful, and
weird all at the same time... I absolutely love this band, and you
should too.

The Secret Prostitutes: Fantasi di Auschwitz 7" (Bat Shit)
Repress of this hard to find SP's EP on Bat Shit Records. 8 songs of
their patented manic, melodic punk rock... "Fantasi Di Auschwitz" is
one of their best songs, and now you can own it on vinyl like the good
lord intended.

L=C3=B6gnhalsmottagningen: Billigtf=C3=B6rpackadstandardpunk 7" (Bat Shit)
Latest 7" from one of the most obnoxiously-named bands in punk. Like
their recent split 7" with Bad Daddies, this is some blazing fast,
super catchy punk rock. The band they most resemble is the Secret
Prostitutes, though without the unique vocals... this guy still has a
high voice, but it's a little more conventional, giving this is a vibe
like sped-up 70s Euro-punk... think Ivy Green or Lost Kids playing on
45 instead of 33. They also do a lightning-speed cover of "Love Song"
by the Damned. A total ripper, with hooks to spare.

Parasite: Proof of the Existence 7" (Holy Terror)
Latest 7" from this Japanese HC / metal band that has been
relentlessly championed by Dwid from Integrity. If you're not an
Integrity fan, though, don't let that dissuade you, because this is
pure ugly, Japanese punk/metal in the GISM tradition. I've heard a few
of Parasite's super-limited releases before this, and it's really
uncanny how well they tap into that classic Randy Uchida riffing style
(like a drunk Iron Maiden sort of) and the vocals are an admirably
warped impression of Sakevi as well. All in all two stone-cold
rippers... extremely highly recommended for fans of the band and
style.

Mutoid Man: Helium Head 12" (Magic Bullet)
Debut LP from this new band featuring Stephen Brodsky of Cave In and
Ben Koller of Converge. The first thing that people who read that name
are going to want to know is "is it heavy?" and the answer is a
resounding "yes!" It's not just a rehash of their classic records,
though... there's a lot here that wasn't in either metal-era Cave In
or classic converge. There's a strong psych rock influence running
through the guitar-playing... it's not quite Jupiter-type spacey, but
it's often drenched in wah, and the drumming is just furious and
technical the way you want this style to be. So, you get something
that's the same, but different... really, this kind of sounds like the
lost link between Until Your Heart Stops and Jupiter, with a bit of
the spazzy rhythms of Petitioning the Empty Sky thrown in... a real
shredder.

Beastmilk: Climax 12" (Magic Bullet)
Finally, one of the most hyped metal releases of 2013 gets a US vinyl
release, but honestly this thing isn't really metal at all, at least
not to my ears. One of the most fertile scenes right now seems to be
the cross-pollination of underground metal and post-punk, whether it's
the lush, My Bloody Valentine-influenced soundscapes of Deafheaven or
the more aggressive, Hellhammer-meets-the-Fall sound of Raspberry
Bulbs, and Beastmilk are probably the band in this sub-sub-genre most
likely to really go somewhere. This actually reminds me quite a lot of
the first Deathcharge LP in the way it mixes the lush, bass-driven
sound of Joy Division and Echo and the Bunnymen with heavier
influences, but this is much more polished, maybe even verging on
radio-friendly. Recommended for fans of Savages, Flesh World, Pleasure
Leftists, and other bands mining the more pop-influenced end of the
dark post-punk sound.

Deep Wound: S/T 7" (Armageddon)
Finally, a spot-on reissue of this seminal early 80s HC record. Of
course Deep Wound are most famous for featuring a pre-Dinosaur Jr Lou
Barlow and J Mascis, but really this would be a highly-regarded EP
even if that weren't the case. Certainly one of the fastest bands of
their time, they also just seethed anger in a way that few others
did... they're definitely in a class with bands like Negative Approach
and Minor Threat, or at the very least only a notch or two below them.
This reissue replicates the original packaging and track listing...
totally essential if you don't already own this material.

Dropdead / Ruidosa Inmundicia: Split 7" (Armageddon)
Two new tracks from Dropdead, and much like their recent split with
Systematic Death it's not as frantic as their early stuff but
extremely well-written and super catchy. As for Ruidosa Inmundicia,
they contribute three new tracks in their own unique style. You can
tell they're heavily influenced by Japanese hardcore and that comes
out in the riffs and the guitar sound, but the drumming is pure 80s
European hardcore. This juxtaposition definitely gives their sound a
uniqueness that it wouldn't have if they were just a 100% burning
spirits style band.

Dropdead / Systematic Death: Split 7" (Armageddon)
Brand new split 7" between these two long-running bands. I can't
remember the last new Dropdead material that I heard, but this stuff
is ripping... not quite as blistering fast as some of their old stuff,
but letting the foot off the gas pedal ever so slightly makes things
way catchier. As for Systematic Death, they continue on the tear
they've been on ever since reforming with two tracks of their patented
blistering hardcore. Throw in a Sugi illustration on the sleeve and
you need this!

Exit Hippies / Lotus Fucker: Split 12" (SPHC)
Brand new material from both bands. Exit Hippies continue their total
deconstruction of music, but unlike a lot of "noise not music" bands,
they actually have a sense of catchiness and dynamics in their music.
It's wild and out there for sure, but you'll actually listen to it as
well... it's easy to see why people go nuts for this band. As for
Lotus Fucker, while their previous material has had a very Gauze-esque
feel, this feels a little more in line with the Kyushu noise sound...
a little looser, a little noisier, and the vocals higher-pitched and
nastier. Throw in some brilliant cover artwork and you have quite the
noise-punk pairing.

Nekrofilth: Devil's Breath 12" (Hell's Headbangers)
Debut LP for this new Nunslaughter-related (I believe) band out of
Cleveland. This is just a pure metal-punk banger... it has all of the
aggression of prime-era Slayer, but nasty punk vocals that (as pointed
out to me by Scott from Double Negative) sound a lot like Dr. Know.
This is just heavy, nasty stuff... it sounds like exactly the type of
music that your parents don't want you to listen to. Highly
recommended.

Shitfucker: Sucks Cocks in Hell 12" (Hell's Headbangers)
Debut 12" from this Detroit band that has been kicking around the
crust and metal scenes for several years. I believe this band are
crusties (my old band Devour actually played with them once) but they
play primitive metal-punk a la Venom or first LP-era Bathory. It's
loose--maybe even sloppy--but the hooks are undeniable, and it sounds
evil as hell. If you can get down with those two records you need to
hear this... a total banger.

Seven Inches to Freedom zine #12
Latest issue of this long-running zine out of Florida. This time
around you get the usual columns and reviews, but the centerpiece is a
lengthy tour diary of the last Panzram tour with detailed descriptions
and reviews of all of the bands they played with... in that sense it
ends up reading like an extremely well-connected, interesting scene
report of current progressive, forward-thinking hardcore bands in the
US.

Plastic Bags: Blind Them All cassette (Helta Skelta)
2nd tape from this Australian band who play strong, 70s-inspired
catchy punk. Last time around they had a real Dangerhouse vibe, but a
bit of a thinner guitar sound and more up-front vocals this time
around put them more in line with the garage-y-est, most fun Bikini
Kills songs like "I Hate Danger." I can see fans of Good Throb or even
Shitty Limits digging on this hard... just solid, straightforward,
catchy, well-performed punk.

Mystic Inane: tape #2 cassette (self-released)
Second demo tape from this New Orleans punk band featuring former
members of Necro Hippies. Their first tape was quite raw, but this one
is a little more polished, but has that same slightly naive appeal
that made their first tape and the Necro Hippies stuff so great. In a
way this kind of reminds me of Nasa Space Universe in that it's
slightly creepy-sounding and super snotty but still hardcore; however,
the sound is much thinner and has more of an authentic early 80s vibe.
In short, this one is highly recommended for anyone who likes catchy,
inventive, and vital classic-sounding hardcore punk.

Sacrilege: It's Time to Face the Reaper 12" (Havoc)
First official vinyl release for these Sacrilege demos, and people
are STOKED. This double LP features four demos recorded between 1984
and 1986, and of course they feature a rougher, rawer sound than the
versions we've all become accustomed to. Sacrilege perfectly rode the
line between crust punk and early thrash metal, and of course these
rawer recordings find them leaning even more heavily toward the crusty
side. Mandatory listening for crusties everywhere.

Concrete Asylum: S/T 7" (Bad Vibrations)
Debut 7" from this new band from Halifax, Canada featuring members of
Abject Pax, Negative Rage, and Grump. Concrete Asylum are more in the
Kremlin mold though... gnarly, noisy hardcore that seems to owe as
much of a debt to prime 90s HC like Citizens Arrest as it does the
early 80s classics and Discharge. In other words, you get lots of
weird little guitar flourishes and quirky rhythm changes, but all of
this is put toward making it as raging as possible.

Mercy Killings: S/T 7" (Beach Impediment)
Debut 7" from this new mid-Atlantic powerhouse. Featuring 2 guys from
Direct Control, 2 from Wasted Time, and Sorry State's own Jeff
(ex-Stripmines) on guitar. This sounds pretty much like you hope it
would, i.e. picking up right where Wasted Time left off with some
beastly Poison Idea-inspired riffage. Mercy Killings also features
those infectious basslines that made WT so great and Mark's
always-authoritative vocals. Top it off with some sick full-color
artwork from Guillem of Destino Final and you have an essential
hardcore record.

Secret Prostitutes: Welcome to Punk 12" (Torture Garden)
Brand new LP from these Texas punk kings. The subtitle of this record
is Viva La Evoluci=C3=B3n, and it's a fitting title as the band has
expanded their sound quite a bit on this release. They've always had a
flair for the unexpected, and there's certainly a lot of their snotty,
80s Euro-style punk on this full-length, but my favorite moments are
the ones where the band is a little more adventurous, and a little
more poppy / new wave-y. There are moments on this LP (particularly
the brilliant last song) that recall Wire or the Buzzcocks at their
finest, and while those are the moments that stick out the Secret
Prostitutes are a multi-trick pony if I ever saw one. Like all of
their releases, this one is highly recommended, but I'm pretty sure
it's also my favorite SP record yet.

COMA: S/T 12" (Danger)
Reissue of this 1979 French cold wave banger, whose singer would go
on to be in another seminal French new wave band, Charles de Goal.
COMA sound like they were quite inspired by the early minimal synth
scene... I'm not sure how connected all of these bands are, but
there's quite a similar sound to the Normal, the Screamers, early
Tubeway Army and Metal Urbain. There are still guitars here, so it's
not as minimal as, say, early Depeche Mode, and the rhythms are
generally speedy and agitated... fans of the Normal and the Screamers
will definitely dig this hard.

Sex Crime: S/T 7" (Danger)
4-song 7" from this new Portland band with members of the Epoxies. I
haven't heard the Epoxies in years, but I remember them having an
extremely polished sound... Sex Crime, by contrast, is a lot more raw
and full-sounding, though they make use of the same gooey-sounding
keyboard melodies. The music is high-energy garage-punk of the type
that Dirtnap Records seems to specialize in, but the synth melodies
will satisfy your sweet tooth. Pretty killer.

Realities of War: S/T 7" (Not Very Nice)
Vinyl reissue for this obscure 1992 demo tape featuring Jacky from
the almighty Framtid collaborating with a friend on some tunes heavily
influenced by Sore Throat and Disaster. If you don't know those bands,
rest assured this is very much in the tradition of Why?-era
Discharge... loud, noisy, and raging. You know Jacky knows what's up,
and if you crave the d-beat you'll love this.

Abject Pax: S/T 7" (Sewercide)
Debut 7" from this Canadian band that features members of a slew of
other NE Canadian bands. This is some rad anarcho-informed hardcore...
some songs have a more straightforward vibe a la Dirt or Icons of
Filth, but I like it when they get weird, like on the second track,
"Mind & Body," which has a quirky, Subhumans-esque rhythm and totally
bizarre, haunting lady backup vox that really sound like nothing else
I can think of. There are a lot of bands out there resurrecting the
old anarcho sound as of late, but few of them capture the spirit of
experimentation as well as Abject Pax do, while still staying grounded
in a straightforward, catchy sound. Highly recommended.

Creep: Creep Tape cassette (Electric Assault)
Demo tape from this new NYC band that I believe features a few
familiar faces. It's a different sound, though, than I've associated
with NYC for the past several years... obviously extremely inspired by
Warzone as well as Agnostic Front, this sounds like those bands'
rawest and most inspired releases. It's really the best of both
worlds, with the killer metallic riffing of Warzone mixed with the
raw, vibrant sound of modern NYC punk. Totally killer.

Negative Trend: S/T 7" (Superior Viaduct)
Repress of this seminal early California punk/HC document featuring
members that would go on to form Flipper. This is pure, snotty
first-wave California punk, though, easily the peer of the similar
releases on Dangerhouse Records, and a good bit rougher and tougher
than those. Four songs of nihilistic, snotty punk... a total
essential.

Nemesis: Gyou-Shou 7" (Solar Funeral)
2nd 7" from this great Japanese hardcore band. On their first 7" I
was blown away with their raw hardcore attack, which immediately
brought to mind Warhead's classic Cry of Truth EP. This time around
they have a slightly rougher recording that reminds me even MORE of
Warhead, and a totally gnarly, throat-shredding performance from the
vocalist. An absolutely essential Japanese HC record... highly
recommended.

Hi everyone and welcome to the Sorry State update for January! Things =
continue to be relatively quiet on the label front, but we do have a new =
release planned for January: the second Brain F&ne; LP, <i>Empty Set</i>, =
should finally be out this month! We just finally finished the artwork and =
the vinyl has been pressed already, so barring an last-minute weirdness =
this should be available for you to order in the next couple of weeks. I =
couldn't be more excited about this record... I like it even more than =
their great first LP. Watch your favorite web sites for some preview =
streams over the next couple of weeks, as Alex at Grave Mistake (with whom =
I'm co-releasing the record) and I are keeping this one close to our =
chests until the release date.<br><br>
After that the only release with solid plans is the new Dark Ages LP. I've =
heard some rough mixes and they already sound astounding... there's =
definitely a progression from the first LP as the band has mixed in some =
brooding sounds with their lightning-fast hardcore. I'm not sure when =
this'll be done with mixing, but I'm guessing it should be out sometime in =
early spring.<br><br>
As I mentioned before, the label will be quiet for a bit after that as we =
continue running the store and the distro, but a few Sorry State bands =
have new records in the works so don't think we're anywhere near done =
yet.<br><br>

Hey everyone!
So I always feel like I'm terrible at doing these "Top 10s of the year =
things" because I know I'm probably forgetting something or that it's too =
obvious, but here's just a quick list of records I thought were really =
good this past year in no particular order:<br><br>
1. Infern&ouml;h - 7 Sp&aring;r EP<br>
2. Framtid - Defeat of Civilization<br>
3. Sickoids - No Home<br>
4. Manipulation - Manipulation LP<br>
5. Criaturas - Espiritu De Libertad<br>
6. Pleasure Leftists - Pleasure Leftists LP<br>
7. Padkarosda - Szabadul&aacute;som M=C5=B1v&eacute;szete<br>
8. Green Beret - Cult of State EP<br>
9. Radioactivity - Radioactivity LP<br>
10. Die - S/T EP<br><br>
So there it is, short and sweet.
I'm really looking forward to 2014 being another awesome year for Sorry =
State.
Thanks for reading!<br><br>
-Jeff<br><br>

I'm not much for end of the year lists.
I can't remember what came out last month much less 11 months ago. I know =
any attempt to make one would end up with endless revising and going =
through my records over and over trying to remember what came out this =
year and then overlooking a million things I would like to put in.
Anyways my list would probably just end up saying Love Triangle ten times.
But yeah 2013 was another year with plenty of good albums and great shows.
It's gone though and no list will bring it back.
Instead I'm looking forward to this new year and new month.
There are a handful of great shows coming up in the Raleigh area this =
month.
Also there's lots of new Raleigh/ NC bands playing these shows.
I'm excited to see Skemata and Vacant Planet who are two new bands from =
around.
Then after a month or so off both Black Zinfandel and No Love will be back =
to playing shows, writing songs, and hopefully recording.
That's all about I have for this month.
I promise next month to actually talk about records.<br><br>

In case you haven't noticed yet, the theme of this month's update is the =
year-end list, so here's mine. There are a bunch of rad things like the =
Arms Race demo and Glue demo 7" that I haven't really had a chance to =
digest yet, but would probably get on this list if I made it in a month, =
but for now I'll stick to my most-listened to 2013 releases. By the way, =

Savage Amused: demo 12" (Mind Cure)<br>
Reissue of the surviving recordings by this early Pittsburgh hardcore =
band. Though they were around in 1985, they don't really sound anything =
like the crossover that was popular at the time. Really, they almost sound =
like a lost relic of proto-hardcore... I'm reminded a lot of the gnarliest =
Cleveland punk bands like the Pagans or a faster Dead Boys. In other =
words, it's fast and extremely tough, but also quite catchy. Fans of =
similarly tough punk bands like Battalion of Saints or Toxic Reason take =
note... this is a real undiscovered gem.<br><br>

Deafheaven: <i>Sunbather</i> 12" (Death Wish)<br>
Vinyl issue for one of the most talked-about releases of the year, metal =
or otherwise. With <i>Sunbather</i>, Deafheaven have created one of those =
releases that is so strikingly original and singular that it's almost =
difficult to wrap my mind around. Taking up where, say, Liturgy left off, =
Deafheaven infuse the raw black metal template with more melody than I =
would have really thought possible... and they're dreamy, spacey melodies =
at that. Try your best to imagine Darkthrone playing Sunny Day Real Estate =
or My Bloody Valentine covers and that will get you somewhere in the =
ballpark of what this sounds like, but really it's its own thing.<br><br>

Doses: S/T 12" (Going Underground)<br>
LA's Doses follow up their excellent <i>Live in Waco, Texas</i> tape with =
this monstrous debut LP. On the live tape they sounded more like hardcore =
with a drum machine (they did cover Cro-Mags on that tape after all), but =
their noise rock influences are closer to the fore on this LP. The band do =
a really great job of fusing off-kilter heaviness with the subtle =
catchiness that made bands like Unsane great... these are songs, but =
they're ugly, uncomfortable songs. A really striking and powerful =
LP.<br><br>

Cro-Mags: <i>Age of Quarrel</i> 12" (Brass City Boss Sounds)<br>
Straight reissue of one of the greatest hardcore records of all time. =
<i>Age of Quarrel</i> is sort of like the <i>Reign in Blood</i> of tough =
hardcore... if you have only one record in your collection that you could =
reasonably mosh to, then <i>Age of Quarrel</i> should probably be it. This =
reissue pretty much perfectly replicates the original's packaging and =
sound... 100% essential.<br><br>

Glue: Demo 7" (Lagerville)<br>
Vinyl issue for one of those most talked-about hardcore demos of 2013. =
After one of the most epic hardcore intros I've heard in some time (and =
one worth of the band name's SSD reference), this launches into some =
absolutely scorching hardcore punk. I could describe the sound of this, =
which is pretty much pure 80s hardcore with snotty vox a la Gordon Solie =
Motherfuckers, but really what makes this demo stand out is the =
songwriting. The band have a way of varying the tempos and the riffing in =
a way that really keeps you on your toes and just constantly wanting more. =
Easily one of the best-written and funnest hardcore demos since the Boston =
Strangler. Highly recommended.<br><br>

Jimmy Smack: <i>Death Rocks</i> 7" (Death Vault)<br>
Archival release of this obscure early 80s California synth punk project. =
Apparently Jimmy Smack shared bills with numerous bands from the early LA =
hardcore scene royalty, but this is the first I've heard of him... this =
some great, dark, minimal synth-punk in the Screamers vein though. It =
seems like synth bands from this era often come from the Human League end =
of things, but Jimmy Smack is pure dark punk... really sinister-sounding, =
and if you're a fan of the Screamers or the Normal you will definitely =
flip for this. Really killer.<br><br>

Bad People: <i>Mean Talkin'</i> 7" (Feeble Minds)<br>
Following quickly on the heels of their debut, here's the 2nd 7" from =
Buffalo's Bad People. As I noted in the description of their 1st EP, this =
band is ex-Brown Sugar and definitely has a lot of that band's off-kilter =
hardcore punk in their DNA; however, particularly on this EP Bad People =
are even catchier and more punk-sounding. The helium vocals recall the =
Dickies or numerous Killed by Death-type bands, but the tight, fast, and =
catchy playing makes me think of something more like Rhino 39... =
definitely one of my favorite current bands, and this new record is even =
more highly recommended than their first.<br><br>

Generacion Suicida / Catholic Spit: Split 7" (MMM)<br>
Two new songs from Generacion Suicida featuring their patented Vicious / =
Masshysteri-style punk... catchy, fast, raw and melodic. As for Catholic =
Spit, they're a little more straightforwardly post-punk, but their =
contribution is much more upbeat and fun than a lot of the =
Siouxsie-inspired stuff I've heard lately. Yeah, there's lots of chorus on =
the guitar, but the inspiration seems to be more stuff like Legal Weapon =
and very early Christian Death (but even faster). Overall a solid split 7" =
from two of California's most talked-about punk bands.<br><br>

Permanent Ruin: <i>Mas Alla de la Muerte</i> 7" (Warthog Speak)<br>
Brand new EP from this NorCal hardcore band featuring Mariam from =
Condenada on vocals. I've heard Permanent Ruin described as having a power =
violence influence and I guess that's true (there's a brief blast break at =
the beginning of "Solution"), but like my favorite bands who get described =
as power violence, this sounds more like straightforward hardcore played =
super, super fast and angry. In other words, it's fast, but the changes =
from fast to mid-paced parts don't feel gimmicky or overwrought. =
Definitely one of the tightest, angriest bands out right now... =
recommended.<br><br>

Mayday!: S/T 7" (self-released)<br>
New 7" from this band from upstate NY who had a split 7" with Brown Sugar. =
I don't know what it is, but bands from this area (I'm thinking =
specifically of Skate Korpse and Insubordinates) have this perfect, =
slightly weird combination of surf and punk... it's kind of like early =
Agent Orange, but really it's its own thing and a sound that is very much =
native to that particular region. Mayday are definitely in that vein, and =
if you dig the more original and interesting strands of music coming out =
of this region you should definitely check out this EP.<br><br>

Eel: <i>Turn Up Fuck</i> 7" (Mind Cure)<br>
Debut EP from this new band of Pittsburgh miscreants. I caught their promo =
video online a few weeks ago and they had a very kind of neo-noise punk =
sound a la Vaginors, but the recording on this EP is much uglier, nastier, =
and harder. It really does sound like first-gen Kyushu noisecore, Gai in =
particularly. It has the same bouncy bass, incredibly ugly vocals and the =
guitar isn't quite distorted into the realm of utter stupidity. This thing =
is super super limited and I believe already sold out from the label, so =
grab it now if you want it.<br><br>

Koward: S/T 7" (Total Fucker)<br>
New EP from this new Boston d-beat band (or maybe they're split between =
Boston and Portland?). This is some stomping, catchy d-beat... it's =
vaguely in the same universe as Framtid, but something about it is a =
little less brutal and a little more punk, but just as heavy and tough. =
Definitely one of the standout d-beat records I've heard of late.<br><br>

Arm's Race: demo cassette (Flophouse)<br>
US pressing of the demo from this new London band featuring members of =
Stab. While Stab are all about the Heresy / Ripcord sound, Arm's Race are =
a much nastier, more brutal, early 80s-sounding band. There's still that =
hint of metal to the riffing, but really this is nearly a dead ringer for =
early Agnostic Front in places... almost like it's some long-lost demo =
from between <I>United Blood</i> and <i>Victim in Pain</i>. Absolutely =
essential... highest possible recommendation.<br><br>

Public Suicide: demo cassette (Flophouse)<br>
Another in the new wave of one-man straight edge bands sweeping the =
nation. This one is out of DC and definitely a bit on the harder end of =
things. While it's speedy and snappy like early 80s hardcore, there's a =
meatiness to the riffing that belies an influence from early Madball and =
the type of NYHC bands that appeared on the <i>New Breed</i> compilation. =
Fast, tight, and extremely well-executed.<br><br>

Komplott: <i>Sei Vivo</i> cassette (Flophouse)<br>

catchiness.<br><br>

Obstruct: <i>No Life + Demo</i> cassette (Flophouse)<br>
Cassette release featuring the debut EP and demo from this UK straight =
edge band. Definitely more in the No Tolerance / modern Boston school of =
sxe HC, this is heavy, bulldozer stuff that packs quite a punch. UKHC has =
been killing it lately and it's great to see that the scene has some depth =
to it. Highly recommended if you're interested in No Tolerance, Violent =
Reaction, or modern sxe HC with an early 80s slant check this out.<br><br>

Aube: demo cassette (self-released)<br>
Demo tape from this Ottawa post-punk band. This has the heavy reverb and =
chorus that you expect from the genre, but also has a kind of snotty punk =
vibe that I don't generally associate with this dense post-punk sound. You =
can tell Bauhaus is a major influence, but the more punk vocals definitely =
give it a little something that it wouldn't have otherwise. A solid entry =
into the canon of modern post-punk.<br><br>

No Negative: <i>Album Blanc</i> cassette (self-released)<br>
Another Canadian post-punk demo, and it's another gem. You get some =
heavily chorus-ed out guitar, propulsive punk rhythms and a powerful =
rhythm section. This actually reminds me a little bit of Beastmilk in that =
the songs are extraordinarily well written, but the delivery is a lot =
scrappier, more DIY and more punk. Definitely one of the best =
post-punk-type things I've heard in ages.<br><br>

Heron: <i>Ritual</i> cassette (self-released)<br>
Debut EP from this North Carolina black metal band. While the base here is =
definitely classic-sounding black metal with haunting keyboards, there are =
some really interesting kind of progressive breaks that give this a really =
unique feel. Beautiful recording and powerful, atmospheric =
songwriting.<br><br>

Sperm: demo cassette (self-released)<br>
Demo tape from this new NY band featuring Josh from Shoppers / Bad People. =
I'm not really sure if the band were going for this at all, but the =
similarities to Broken Prayer are really striking. Like BP, nearly every =
song here is different from the last. There are some kind of brooding =
post-punk songs, some quirky midwest-style HC a la Die Kreuzen, and some =
stuff that just sounds like straightforward punk. All of it is raw, =
powerful, and interesting... if you're into forward-thinking punk and =
hardcore I highly recommend this one.<br><br>

Vaccine / No Faith: Split 7" (Vinyl Rites)<br>
Brand new split 7" from these two Massachusetts straight edge bands. No =
Faith follow up their LP on Painkiller with more of their crushing =
sound... all you get is slow here... no go at all, but it's noisy and =
angry as hell. As for Vaccine, these are their final tracks and they're =
right in line with their earlier stuff... almost impossibly fast and =
vicious straight edge hardcore with just ridiculous tempo changes and =
arrangements. Fans of Infest could definitely get down with this, but I =
wouldn't call it power violence as such... just super fast and mean =
hardcore.<br><br>

The Insults: <i>Population Zero</i> 7" (Last Laugh)<br>
You may know "Population Zero" from its inclusion on <i>Killed by Death #8 =
1/2</i>, and it's a great slice of minimal, UK-influenced KBD punk... it's =
got the loose, rawness of the best KBD stuff, but something about the =
driving, almost rockabilly-ish bass line reminds me of UK stuff, maybe =
even the early Fall? As for the flip, it's very much in the same vein with =
a fast tempo, high guitars and rumbling bass... in a way it reminds me of =
the Warsaw stuff, but not quite as dark. This is definitely all you want =
from a KBD reissue, so don't sleep!<br><br>

Sick Thoughts: <i>Terminal Teen Age</i> 12" (Dead Beat)<br>
Debut LP from this one man band out of Baltimore who clearly worships at =
the altar of Jay Reatard. Their earlier 7" on Can't Stand Ya! really blew =
me away with their big garage hooks, but the LP is a little more Reatards =
and a little less Jay Solo... in other words, the hooks are a little more =
buried and the recording is super blown out, approaching total fuzz in the =
bottom end. Still, there's plenty of killer riffs and tracks here, and if =
you want to hear some strong Reatards worship you'll flip for =
this.<br><br>

The Kurws: <i>Hole in the Ghetto</i> 12" (Bat Shit)<br>
US version of this Polish band's debut LP. Something a little bit =
different for Bat Shit, this is an all-instrumental band that plays =
hyperactive, skronky stuff... sort of like the Minutement or the Urinals =
at their most abstract moments, but even at time approaching the dizziness =
of the Residents. Rad artwork on this bad boy too.<br><br>

Vermaio: <i>MMDF</i> 7" (Bat Shit)<br>
Debut 7" by this new Italian project featuring two of the guys from Fogna. =
It's a bit more straightforward and punk than Fogna... it still has that =
distinct Rudimentary Peni influence, but it also reminds me a lot of both =
classic Mexican hardcore and newer stuff like Inservibles. At any rate, =
it's incredibly mean, nasty and ugly... great stuff, just as good if not =
better than Fogna.<br><br>

Fogna: S/T 7" (Bat Shit)<br>
Repress of the super limited debut EP by this Italian HC project. Deep, =
dark Rudimentary Peni vibes here... this music is dense, laden with =
feedback and dark as hell, but it also has the catchiness of Rudi P as =
well. In an interesting decision, this is recorded with a drum machine =
rather than a live drummer, and it really lends itself to the cold, =
desolate feel that the music has. A total stand-out, and highly =
recommneded.<br><br>

Spasma: <i>Mediocrazia</i> 7" (Bat Shit)<br>
Yet another Fogna-related side project from Bat Shit Records, though this =
one is a little different. While most of this crew's stuff tends to be =
marked by a heavy Rudimentary Peni influence (or at least what sounds like =
it to me), Spasma are much more straightforward, with a recording that =
very strongly recalls Poison Idea's classic <i>Darby Crash Rides =
Again</i>, perhaps mixed with some nasty early European hardcore like =
Agent Orange or Wretched. Regardless, this has absolutely perfect early =
80s-sounding analog production and the songwriting is flat-out ripping =
from top to bottom... can't recommend this one highly enough.<br><br>

Kaivosurma: <i>Lootin Vaimo</i> 7" (Bat Shit)<br>
New EP by this blazing Finnish HC band... angry, straightforward stuff =
without a lot of the frills and complex musicianship of, say, Sokea Piste, =
but instead focusing on maximum rage. Consider this in the tradition of =
classics like Lama and newer stuff like Kieltolaki. I dig the super weird =
cover artwork too.<br><br>

Pierre and Bastien: <i>Cancer</i> 7" (Bat Shit)<br>
New 7" from this Parisian band. This is catchy, poppy stuff that reminds =
me a lot of the stuff coming out of Copenhagen a few years ago... it bears =
more than a passing resemblance to Gorilla Angreb (no lady vox though) as =
well as that great Peter Bonneman solo single that not a lot of people =
heard. In other words, this is fast and punk, but also super catchy and =
with something about it that feels vaguely progressive and post-punk. In a =
way it sounds like an early Rough Trade single, but without any sort of =
pretensions to recreating that style at all... it's just two great catchy, =
punk songs with awesome DIY production.<br><br>

released on Sub Pop(?!?). It's easy to see why, because this band can =
write a freaking hook. Yeah, it's bathed in lots of that My Bloody =
Valentine-influenced reverb and distortion, but so many bands recreate =
this sound without the great songwriting. Not HEBV, though... this guy can =
write a tune, and the two songs here are catchy, beautiful, and weird all =
at the same time... I absolutely love this band, and you should =
too.<br><br>

The Secret Prostitutes: <i>Fantasi di Auschwitz</i> 7" (Bat Shit)<br>
Repress of this hard to find SP's EP on Bat Shit Records. 8 songs of their =
patented manic, melodic punk rock... "Fantasi Di Auschwitz" is one of =
their best songs, and now you can own it on vinyl like the good lord =
intended.<br><br>

L&ouml;gnhalsmottagningen: <i>Billigtf&ouml;rpackadstandardpunk</i> 7" =
(Bat Shit)<br>
Latest 7" from one of the most obnoxiously-named bands in punk. Like their =
recent split 7" with Bad Daddies, this is some blazing fast, super catchy =
punk rock. The band they most resemble is the Secret Prostitutes, though =
without the unique vocals... this guy still has a high voice, but it's a =
little more conventional, giving this is a vibe like sped-up 70s =
Euro-punk... think Ivy Green or Lost Kids playing on 45 instead of 33. =
They also do a lightning-speed cover of "Love Song" by the Damned. A total =
ripper, with hooks to spare.<br><br>

Parasite: <i>Proof of the Existence</i> 7" (Holy Terror)<br>
Latest 7" from this Japanese HC / metal band that has been relentlessly =
championed by Dwid from Integrity. If you're not an Integrity fan, though, =
don't let that dissuade you, because this is pure ugly, Japanese =
punk/metal in the GISM tradition. I've heard a few of Parasite's =
super-limited releases before this, and it's really uncanny how well they =
tap into that classic Randy Uchida riffing style (like a drunk Iron Maiden =
sort of) and the vocals are an admirably warped impression of Sakevi as =
well. All in all two stone-cold rippers... extremely highly recommended =
for fans of the band and style.<br><br>

Mutoid Man: <i>Helium Head</i> 12" (Magic Bullet)<br>
Debut LP from this new band featuring Stephen Brodsky of Cave In and Ben =
Koller of Converge. The first thing that people who read that name are =
going to want to know is "is it heavy?" and the answer is a resounding =
"yes!" It's not just a rehash of their classic records, though... there's =
a lot here that wasn't in either metal-era Cave In or classic converge. =
There's a strong psych rock influence running through the =
guitar-playing... it's not quite <i>Jupiter</i>-type spacey, but it's =
often drenched in wah, and the drumming is just furious and technical the =
way you want this style to be. So, you get something that's the same, but =
different... really, this kind of sounds like the lost link between =
<i>Until Your Heart Stops</i> and <i>Jupiter</i>, with a bit of the spazzy =
rhythms of <i>Petitioning the Empty Sky</i> thrown in... a real =
shredder.<br><br>

Beastmilk: <i>Climax</i> 12" (Magic Bullet)<br>
Finally, one of the most hyped metal releases of 2013 gets a US vinyl =
release, but honestly this thing isn't really metal at all, at least not =
to my ears. One of the most fertile scenes right now seems to be the =
cross-pollination of underground metal and post-punk, whether it's the =
lush, My Bloody Valentine-influenced soundscapes of Deafheaven or the more =
aggressive, Hellhammer-meets-the-Fall sound of Raspberry Bulbs, and =
Beastmilk are probably the band in this sub-sub-genre most likely to =
really go somewhere. This actually reminds me quite a lot of the first =
Deathcharge LP in the way it mixes the lush, bass-driven sound of Joy =
Division and Echo and the Bunnymen with heavier influences, but this is =
much more polished, maybe even verging on radio-friendly. Recommended for =
fans of Savages, Flesh World, Pleasure Leftists, and other bands mining =
the more pop-influenced end of the dark post-punk sound.<br><br>

Deep Wound: S/T 7" (Armageddon)<br>
Finally, a spot-on reissue of this seminal early 80s HC record. Of course =
Deep Wound are most famous for featuring a pre-Dinosaur Jr Lou Barlow and =
J Mascis, but really this would be a highly-regarded EP even if that =
weren't the case. Certainly one of the fastest bands of their time, they =
also just seethed anger in a way that few others did... they're definitely =
in a class with bands like Negative Approach and Minor Threat, or at the =
very least only a notch or two below them. This reissue replicates the =
original packaging and track listing... totally essential if you don't =
already own this material.<br><br>

Dropdead / Ruidosa Inmundicia: Split 7" (Armageddon)<br>
Two new tracks from Dropdead, and much like their recent split with =
Systematic Death it's not as frantic as their early stuff but extremely =
well-written and super catchy. As for Ruidosa Inmundicia, they contribute =
three new tracks in their own unique style. You can tell they're heavily =
influenced by Japanese hardcore and that comes out in the riffs and the =
guitar sound, but the drumming is pure 80s European hardcore. This =
juxtaposition definitely gives their sound a uniqueness that it wouldn't =
have if they were just a 100% burning spirits style band.<br><br>

Dropdead / Systematic Death: Split 7" (Armageddon)<br>
Brand new split 7" between these two long-running bands. I can't remember =
the last new Dropdead material that I heard, but this stuff is ripping... =
not quite as blistering fast as some of their old stuff, but letting the =
foot off the gas pedal ever so slightly makes things way catchier. As for =
Systematic Death, they continue on the tear they've been on ever since =
reforming with two tracks of their patented blistering hardcore. Throw in =
a Sugi illustration on the sleeve and you need this!<br><br>

Exit Hippies / Lotus Fucker: Split 12" (SPHC)<br>
Brand new material from both bands. Exit Hippies continue their total =
deconstruction of music, but unlike a lot of "noise not music" bands, they =
actually have a sense of catchiness and dynamics in their music. It's wild =
and out there for sure, but you'll actually listen to it as well... it's =
easy to see why people go nuts for this band. As for Lotus Fucker, while =
their previous material has had a very Gauze-esque feel, this feels a =
little more in line with the Kyushu noise sound... a little looser, a =
little noisier, and the vocals higher-pitched and nastier. Throw in some =
brilliant cover artwork and you have quite the noise-punk pairing.<br><br>

Nekrofilth: <i>Devil's Breath</i> 12" (Hell's Headbangers)<br>
Debut LP for this new Nunslaughter-related (I believe) band out of =
Cleveland. This is just a pure metal-punk banger... it has all of the =
aggression of prime-era Slayer, but nasty punk vocals that (as pointed out =
to me by Scott from Double Negative) sound a lot like Dr. Know. This is =
just heavy, nasty stuff... it sounds like exactly the type of music that =
your parents don't want you to listen to. Highly recommended.<br><br>

Shitfucker: <i>Sucks Cocks in Hell</i> 12" (Hell's Headbangers)<br>
Debut 12" from this Detroit band that has been kicking around the crust =
and metal scenes for several years. I believe this band are crusties (my =
old band Devour actually played with them once) but they play primitive =
metal-punk a la Venom or first LP-era Bathory. It's loose--maybe even =
sloppy--but the hooks are undeniable, and it sounds evil as hell. If you =
can get down with those two records you need to hear this... a total =
banger.<br><br>

Seven Inches to Freedom zine #12<br>
Latest issue of this long-running zine out of Florida. This time around =
you get the usual columns and reviews, but the centerpiece is a lengthy =
tour diary of the last Panzram tour with detailed descriptions and reviews =

progressive, forward-thinking hardcore bands in the US.<br><br>

Plastic Bags: <i>Blind Them All</i> cassette (Helta Skelta)<br>
2nd tape from this Australian band who play strong, 70s-inspired catchy =
punk. Last time around they had a real Dangerhouse vibe, but a bit of a =
thinner guitar sound and more up-front vocals this time around put them =
more in line with the garage-y-est, most fun Bikini Kills songs like "I =
Hate Danger." I can see fans of Good Throb or even Shitty Limits digging =
on this hard... just solid, straightforward, catchy, well-performed =
punk.<br><br>

Mystic Inane: tape #2 cassette (self-released)<br>
Second demo tape from this New Orleans punk band featuring former members =
of Necro Hippies. Their first tape was quite raw, but this one is a little =
more polished, but has that same slightly naive appeal that made their =
first tape and the Necro Hippies stuff so great. In a way this kind of =
reminds me of Nasa Space Universe in that it's slightly creepy-sounding =
and super snotty but still hardcore; however, the sound is much thinner =
and has more of an authentic early 80s vibe. In short, this one is highly =
recommended for anyone who likes catchy, inventive, and vital =
classic-sounding hardcore punk.<br><br>

Sacrilege: <i>It's Time to Face the Reaper</i> 12" (Havoc)<br>
First official vinyl release for these Sacrilege demos, and people are =
STOKED. This double LP features four demos recorded between 1984 and 1986, =
and of course they feature a rougher, rawer sound than the versions we've =
all become accustomed to. Sacrilege perfectly rode the line between crust =
punk and early thrash metal, and of course these rawer recordings find =
them leaning even more heavily toward the crusty side. Mandatory listening =
for crusties everywhere.<br><br>

Concrete Asylum: S/T 7" (Bad Vibrations)<br>
Debut 7" from this new band from Halifax, Canada featuring members of =
Abject Pax, Negative Rage, and Grump. Concrete Asylum are more in the =
Kremlin mold though... gnarly, noisy hardcore that seems to owe as much of =
a debt to prime 90s HC like Citizens Arrest as it does the early 80s =
classics and Discharge. In other words, you get lots of weird little =
guitar flourishes and quirky rhythm changes, but all of this is put toward =
making it as raging as possible.<br><br>

Debut 7" from this new mid-Atlantic powerhouse. Featuring 2 guys from =
Direct Control, 2 from Wasted Time, and Sorry State's own Jeff =
(ex-Stripmines) on guitar. This sounds pretty much like you hope it would, =
i.e. picking up right where Wasted Time left off with some beastly Poison =
Idea-inspired riffage. Mercy Killings also features those infectious =
basslines that made WT so great and Mark's always-authoritative vocals. =
Top it off with some sick full-color artwork from Guillem of Destino Final =
and you have an essential hardcore record.<br><br>

Secret Prostitutes: <i>Welcome to Punk</i> 12" (Torture Garden)<br>
Brand new LP from these Texas punk kings. The subtitle of this record is =
<i>Viva La Evoluci&oacute;n</i>, and it's a fitting title as the band has =
expanded their sound quite a bit on this release. They've always had a =
flair for the unexpected, and there's certainly a lot of their snotty, 80s =
Euro-style punk on this full-length, but my favorite moments are the ones =
where the band is a little more adventurous, and a little more poppy / new =
wave-y. There are moments on this LP (particularly the brilliant last =
song) that recall Wire or the Buzzcocks at their finest, and while those =
are the moments that stick out the Secret Prostitutes are a multi-trick =
pony if I ever saw one. Like all of their releases, this one is highly =
recommended, but I'm pretty sure it's also my favorite SP record =
yet.<br><br>

COMA: S/T 12" (Danger)<br>
Reissue of this 1979 French cold wave banger, whose singer would go on to =
be in another seminal French new wave band, Charles de Goal. COMA sound =
like they were quite inspired by the early minimal synth scene... I'm not =
sure how connected all of these bands are, but there's quite a similar =
sound to the Normal, the Screamers, early Tubeway Army and Metal Urbain. =
There are still guitars here, so it's not as minimal as, say, early =
Depeche Mode, and the rhythms are generally speedy and agitated... fans of =
the Normal and the Screamers will definitely dig this hard.<br><br>

Sex Crime: S/T 7" (Danger)<br>
4-song 7" from this new Portland band with members of the Epoxies. I =
haven't heard the Epoxies in years, but I remember them having an =
extremely polished sound... Sex Crime, by contrast, is a lot more raw and =
full-sounding, though they make use of the same gooey-sounding keyboard =
melodies. The music is high-energy garage-punk of the type that Dirtnap =
Records seems to specialize in, but the synth melodies will satisfy your =
sweet tooth. Pretty killer.<br><br><br><br>

Realities of War: S/T 7" (Not Very Nice)<br>
Vinyl reissue for this obscure 1992 demo tape featuring Jacky from the =
almighty Framtid collaborating with a friend on some tunes heavily =

Abject Pax: S/T 7" (Sewercide)<br>
Debut 7" from this Canadian band that features members of a slew of other =
NE Canadian bands. This is some rad anarcho-informed hardcore... some =
songs have a more straightforward vibe a la Dirt or Icons of Filth, but I =
like it when they get weird, like on the second track, "Mind & Body," =
which has a quirky, Subhumans-esque rhythm and totally bizarre, haunting =
lady backup vox that really sound like nothing else I can think of. There =
are a lot of bands out there resurrecting the old anarcho sound as of =
late, but few of them capture the spirit of experimentation as well as =
Abject Pax do, while still staying grounded in a straightforward, catchy =
sound. Highly recommended.<br><br>

Creep: <i>Creep Tape</i> cassette (Electric Assault)<br>
Demo tape from this new NYC band that I believe features a few familiar =
faces. It's a different sound, though, than I've associated with NYC for =
the past several years... obviously extremely inspired by Warzone as well =
as Agnostic Front, this sounds like those bands' rawest and most inspired =
releases. It's really the best of both worlds, with the killer metallic =
riffing of Warzone mixed with the raw, vibrant sound of modern NYC punk. =
Totally killer.<br><br>

Dangerhouse Records, and a good bit rougher and tougher than those. Four =
songs of nihilistic, snotty punk... a total essential.<br><br>

Nemesis: <i>Gyou-Shou</i> 7" (Solar Funeral)<br>
2nd 7" from this great Japanese hardcore band. On their first 7" I was =
blown away with their raw hardcore attack, which immediately brought to =
mind Warhead's classic <i>Cry of Truth</i> EP. This time around they have =
a slightly rougher recording that reminds me even MORE of Warhead, and a =
totally gnarly, throat-shredding performance from the vocalist. An =
absolutely essential Japanese HC record... highly recommended.<br><br>
