$300.00 Per Month, Brooklyn or NYC Area, Brooklyn, 220 sq. ft., Female Bi=
lliards Artist Seeking Practice Space Share, Studio, Room, Garage or Base=
ment
Available: Sept 01, 2014 through Sept 01, 2015

I am an actor/writer, as well as a billiards artist. I am looking for a p=
ractice space to put my pool table. Ideally, the space would need to be a=
t least 13 X 17 for my billiards table, and I would have access to it 24/=
7 for individual practice.=20

I am flexible in terms of the kind of space.  I just need to be able to g=
et in there and practice. Generally I work weekdays during the day (as a =
graphic designer), so mostly, I would need to be able to access the table=
 after work and on weekends....
