$800 per month, Long Island City, 700 sq sf, Incredibly spacious studio in =

of the area.
Available: January 1 through as long as you want.
$800 700 sq sf
Incredibly spacious art studio in a great building in the heart of Long  Is=
land=20
City, Queens. Conveniently located near MoMA PS1 and the F, G, 7,  N, Q, E =
& M trains.
Super easy 20 minute bike ride from North  Brooklyn (Greenpoint/Williamsbur=
g), 4
 blocks from the Queensboro bridge.  Not far from, not one, but two Home De=
pots=20
and a great local lumber  yard. Great building which includes a welder, a w=
atchmaker,
and other  artists, but it's not one of those big, overpriced artist factor=
ies.=20
24  hours access, and 24 hour access to the freight elevator and loading  d=
ock.=20
You can make noise at anytime of day. Good window light with a  slight view=
 of the
Upper East Side.
The studio is great for any type of artist, and especially for those who  l=
ike to
work big. The space has high ceilings, long, expansive walls,  and double d=
oors=20
for moving big things out.
The space is subleased from a very cool book selling company, who rents  th=
e entire
wing of the floor, so persons inquiring about the space must  be responsibl=
e and
 trustworthy as moving through their company's space  is sometimes necessar=
y. The
bathroom is shared between you and the book  company.
Please let me know if you'd like to come by and see the space. It is a  rea=
lly great
studio and I am somewhat heartbroken that my life's journey  is moving me o=
nward.
I look forward to hearing from you.

$575 per month, Williamsburg, 450 sq. ft. (in 1100 sq. ft. loft), art/desig=
n studio
share in artist built loft
Available: Jan. 15 through onward
Looking for 2 people to share studio/workspace in a work loft
I'm looking for 2 people to share a large, open, loft workspace with.  The =
main=20
part of the space I'm renting out is approximately 450 square  feet, separa=
te from
my workspace. It's a loft in a former textile  factory. I built out the lof=
t several
years ago to split as a  combination live/work space with a friend. I'll be=
 living
in the space  alone and my personal/living area is separate from the open w=
ork area.
The space has great natural light, 3 large windows and East River views.  E=
xposed
brick and beams and wood floors. There's a 10' tall chalkboard  wall, small=
 roof
 deck for lounging or cigarette breaks, a full kitchen  and there's laundry=
. Yeah,
that's right throw a load in while after  effects or your tool/software of =
choice
chugs away on some project. I've  also got a small, separate living room or=
 as it's
called in work speak a  "lounge." There's wifi cable internet, a french pre=
ss and
a moderate  collection of vinyl for listening to music sans computer.
It's 3 blocks from the East River ferry, 10 minutes down Broadway from  the=
 Marcy
JMZ ,15 minute walk from the Bedford L and a half block from  the Kent Ave.=
 bike
 lane. Bike racks are right outside the building.
Marlowe & Sons and Diner - the official Williamsburg hipster gift  shop/cof=
fee shop/restaurant
is a block away- convenient for savory yet  expensive treats and coffee. Al=
so convenient
for informal business  meetings or awkward conversations in public with you=
r ex.
 There's also  an Italian restaurant on the bottom floor and a funky street=
 art=20
gallery  right next door. The building houses a mix of creative/designer ty=
pes.
I'm a video maker/animator and looking for creative types to share the  spa=
ce with.
I'm NOT looking for producer/PR/executive types who's work  consists of neg=
otiations
and phone calls. I AM looking for other  creative types of all stripes who =
make=20
stuff: designers, illustrators,  writers, programmers, basket makers, anima=
tors,
 digital artists, etc.  Unfortunately, I don't have the ventilation for pai=
nters
 and sculptors  so be creative but be non-toxic/clean air breathing. As I l=
ive in
the  space it's important that I can breathe at the end of the day.
The rent will be $575 and 25% of heat and electric each. I'll cover interne=
t. Looking
to get people in by mid-January.

NY, $400 per month, Long Island City, 300 sf, Art studio for share at Reis =
Studios
Available: 01/15/2012
I'm a conceptual painter from Europe seeking a studio-mate to share my  spa=
ce at
 Reis Art Studios in Long Island City, starting January 15. My  studio spac=
e is=20
300 sq. ft. (21x12) with lofty 13 feet ceilings, perfect  for anyone workin=
g with
large canvases or stretchers. The walls are  painted white and the space is=
 overall
very airy with great light, and I  prefer to keep it neat (and am hoping to=
 find
 a studio mate who doesn't  mind keeping the space orderly). The studio inc=
ludes
 a wood loft for  storage, a sink, a large window facing west with a beauti=
ful view
of New  York City and it is private (key access).  It's on the fourth floor=
,  but
the building has a reliable elevator, bathrooms on every floor and a  carpe=
ntry=20
room accessible on request.
The studio is a short walk (one block) located one stop from Manhattan  on =
the E,
M, G or 7 train (Court Square stop) in an up & coming  neighborhood with cu=
te restaurants
and coffee shops. I have found the  other artists at Reis Studios to be sup=
portive,
collaborative and  overall a very inspirational community. The studio organ=
izes=20
open  studios from time to time if you're interested in showcasing your wor=
ks  in
progress. I'm asking for $400/month rent, which includes wi-fi  internet an=
d heat.
I typically spend weekdays at the studio and would  ideally like to find a =
studio-mate
who prefers to work in the studio on  weeknights and weekends so that our s=
chedules
don't overlap.
I would be happy to meet you in person and show you the space if you're int=
erested.

$1000 per month, Red Hook, 160 sf room in 1400 sf loft, One of two bedrooms=
 in creative
sunny warehouse space.
Available: Jan 1 through Negotiable
Looking to share a beautiful live + work space.  It's on the top floor  of =
an old
factory building; 17' ceilings and a full height window wall  with a stunni=
ng view
of the harbor and manhattan & brooklyn  skylines.  Old refinished wood floo=
rs, simple
modern kitchen and  bathroom.  There are two bedrooms tucked in the mezzani=
ne floor
 overlooking the main space -- my girlfriend and I are in one and the  othe=
r is=20
available.  I'm an architect and Maria's an artist and  filmmaker - we're i=
n our
 mid-twenties, both busy and creative people,  always working on one projec=
t or=20
another.
The loft is something of a work in progress, improving bit by bit.  It's  a=
 non-traditional
setup -- we've mounted an industrial ladder on wheels  to access the bedroo=
ms &=20
made a pretty massive coffee table out of a  steel fire door, among other t=
hings
 -- and we'd love to find someone  similarly open to a bit of oddness.  I w=
ork on
bicycles so there's a few  of those about, along with Maria's projects occa=
sionally,
but we  generally keep things pretty organized. One whole wall is built-in =
 storage
cubbies and shelves, of which several are available.  Wireless  and all uti=
lities
are included. Kitchen and cleaning supplies are  provided.  So is a project=
or for
watching gigantic films on the wall.
The building is fantastic -- full of writers and photographers and  artists=
 and=20
musicians, with laundry on the floor and a great super and a  common courty=
ard for
vegetables and barbecuing and whatever, and a  rooftop to boot.  Red Hook i=
s wonderful
and weird, still mostly off the  beaten track and all the better for it.  G=
reat=20
bars, great food, great  creative energy.
The building's on Coffey Park; it's a 10 minute walk over the newly  opened=
 pedestrian
bridge to the F and G and a 10-min walk to Fairway,  the harbor and Steve's=
 Key=20
Lime pies.
No smokers or live-in significant others please.  Love dogs but would  prob=
ably=20
prefer to keep em outside the home.  We'd like to find someone  who's as ex=
cited
 about the space and neighborhood as we are, can keep  things reasonably or=
derly
 and be respectful -- the place feels huge but  it's still more or less one=
 communal
shared area, so being considerate  and easygoing is important.
We spend most of the time we're home cooking, drinking, reading,  watching =
movies,
& working. Both have jobs that keep late nights  mostly to a minimum.  I th=
ink we'll
be renting the space month-to-month,  so only one month's rent up front is =
required,
and a longer stay is  negotiable.
There are 10 photos here and a few more at the website linked at the bottom=

nt. We
have a washer and dryer in the apartment, wireless  internet, and heat. All=
 utilities
are included in the rent. This is more  like a low garden level apartment, =

basement
would be.  You can see what I mean in the kitchen photos (above the sink).
We are a couple of blocks away from the 61st street/Woodside stop on the  7=

About us:
There are three of us living here currently. One is an actor/model/real  es=
tate=20
agent. I am a backstage theatre tech and also work on new  media/interactiv=
e art.
The third would be your roommate. He is an  actor/comedian and is becoming =
a real
estate agent. We are all guys in  our mid to late 20's. When we are home we=
 usually
keep it chill.
The room:
There is a futon in the room for you to use. Also there are shelves for  yo=
u to=20
put your clothes on and in the hallway is another closet which  you can use=
 to hang
up whatever you need. The room has a window opposite  the futon, unfortunat=
ely not
a lot of light gets in though.
Let me know if you are interested and we can set up a time for you to come =
by and
see the place.
Thanks,

$700 per month, Boerum Hill/Ft Green/Park Slope, 1 bedroom, Perfect nest ne=

Available: 1/2/12 through negotiable
Hello! My boyfriend and I moved to NYC together and found a perfect one  be=
droom
 apartment. We made a home, and we love it. Fully decorated,  warm, homey. =
And then,
his job took him out of the city. So now I'm  here, in our nest, and I need=
 to fill
some space. Do you need a place to  work? We have a fully equipped office a=
rea with
high speed internet.  Need a space to create? I can rearrange our living ro=
om so
 that the area  by the windows can accommodate the needs of an artist. Need=
 a place
to  call your base that is close to the 2,3,N,Q,R,D,B,E or G trains? I can =
 arrange
the living room into an open bedroom. This is probably not ideal  for someo=
ne needing
a permanent, full time home, but it would be a  perfect base/office/landing=
 pad=20
for someone who travels or needs a  second space. The rent is negotiable de=
pending
on your needs. You'll  have access to the fully stocked kitchen and bathroo=
m, and
even a  closet.
Please be a non-smoker with no pets, no drugs, no guests.
I'm glad to open our happy home to you - just let me know. I look forward t=
o hearing
from you.

really great, cheap  restaurants in the neighborhood. They just built a new=

peaceful, mostly working class families. Our street is very quiet,  except =
for this
one school bus driver who honks unfailingly on weekday  mornings at 7:45...=
 we can
wave our angry fists at that guy. I'm a video  editor at the Cooper-Hewitt =

$900 per month, Ditmas Park/Midwood (Brooklyn), Large bedroom, One bedroom =

bedroom apt, spacious, quiet.
Available: January 1, 2012 through January 1, 2013
I am renting one big room in a two bedroom apt. It is located on E. 14th  S=
t below
Ave H in BK. The apt. is completely furnished, including the  bedroom. Your=
 roommate
would be my 31 year old brother, who just moved  to NY from Los Angeles and=
 is working
full time as a cook in Manhattan.  His schedule is 3-11p Fri-Tues.
The rent is $900/month, $1800 at move in to cover last month. This is a  lo=
ng term
sublet, the owner is gone one year and a half for work.  Ideally I am looki=
ng for
someone who can make at least a 6 month  commitment, but that is negotiable=
.
The bedroom is West facing and gets good evening light. It has a bed, close=
t, two
dressers, and desk.
The kitchen is stocked with pots and pans, utensils, and plates and  bowls,=
 as well
as everything else you need for a functioning kitchen. As  you can see in t=
he photos,
the apt. is completely furnished from top to  bottom.
Utilities are NOT included in the monthly rent, but usually don't exceed  $=
80/month
total and will be split between the two tenants. That  includes the bill fo=
r high
speed internet, which comes with the apt.
The apt. is one block from the Q train on Ave H, so the commute into  Manha=
ttan=20
is a straight shot, usually about 25-30 min. to Canal which is  the first s=
top in
the city coming from BK.

$850 per month, Clinton Hill, 12'x 13' and 12' x 9'... you get both!, Live/=
 Work!
 Bedroom and Studio/Office, 2 adjoining rooms!
Available: Feb 1
The bedroom is large, 12' x 13', and the adjoining room, which can be  used=
 as a
 studio or whatever you want.   It is 12' x 9'.  The bedroom  has 3 large w=
indows
overlooking Kent and Willoughby (you can see  Manhattan from one of the win=
dows)
  and the studio has one large window.   You would also have free reign ove=
r the
 living room, about 9' x 11',  as I never use it.  There is a 46" flat scre=
en mounted
in the living  room  if you are into it.
The apartment is only a couple blocks from the Classon G and pretty much  t=
he same
distance from the Bedford/Nostrand G.  And is also only few  blocks from Pr=
att,=20
the B48, B38, B62, B44, B54, etc.  Super easy to get  to Williamsburg, Manh=
attan,
etc.
There are lots of restaurants around (Myrtle Ave has opened up a ton of  ne=
w stuff
in the last year) and there is a grocery store, laundromat and  some bodega=
s on=20
the block.  There are 3 grocery stores besides the  really close one in wal=
king=20
distance and the farmer's market on  Saturday's is at Fort Greene Park, als=
o just
blocks away.
The rent is $850 a month, and the bills are electric and internet, which  a=
re never
that expensive (first and last months rent plus $850 security  deposit for =
move=20
in).  The landlady lives in the building and is really  cool.  She receives=
 all=20
mail because she's always home so we've never  had a problem receiving pack=
ages=20
or regular mail.
This is an amazing deal for the right person, as it's a way to have a  larg=
e bedroom
and a separate large studio all in the same apartment,  which is super rare=
 these
days.  It's important for me to find the right  person.  So far,  relaxed f=
emale
 artists have been the kind of person  who has worked out the best, so some=
thing
 in that basic formula is what  I'm looking for, although I'm open to anyon=
e nice,
employed and cool.
A small, friendly and extremely low maintenance cat lives here.  Another co=
ol cat
would be totally welcome.
Oh yes, I'm a 30 year old dude, digital artist and teacher.  I teach for  a=
 local
university (and do some other freelance as well)  and that  takes up most o=
f my=20
time, so I'm not hanging around the apartment all  that much.  When I am he=
re I'm
pretty much always working in my  room/studio.  The cool thing is that the =
rooms
 are on opposite sides of  the apt, so it's easy for us to do our own thing=
 independently.
Looking for someone to move in Feb 1st, possibly even sooner.  Please conta=
ct me

I'm looking for someone to take my 2-bedroom apartment just from January  2=

 January 28th, though the dates are somewhat negotiable. Because  of the od=

I am willing to take a MUCH lower rent than I usually  would-- The tenants =
there
 right now are paying $3650. It's luxuriously  furnished and equipped, and =
an amazing
deal.

The apartment has hardwood floors, lots of light, high-end appliances  (lik=
e a Bosch
dishwasher), a washer/dryer in the unit, a private keyed  elevator, towel w=
armers,
and a balcony. The apartment itself is  generally furnished with mid-centur=

Amazingly, it's also very quiet here, as the elementary school next door  p=
rohibits
bars from being located on our particular block. Similar  apartments in the=
 neighborhood
usually rent for around $5,000 a month.

ctories. 24  hours access, and 24 hour access to the freight elevator and l=
oading  dock. You can make noise at anytime of day. Good window light with =
a  slight view of the Upper East Side.<br /> <br /> The studio is great for=

ace has high ceilings, long, expansive walls,  and double doors for moving =
big things out.<br /> <br /> The space is subleased from a very cool book s=
elling company, who rents  the entire wing of the floor, so persons inquiri=

/> <br /> I'm looking for 2 people to share a large, open, loft workspace w=
ith.  The main part of the space I'm renting out is approximately 450 squar=
e  feet, separate from my workspace. It's a loft in a former textile  facto=
ry. I built out the loft several years ago to split as a  combination live/=
work space with a friend. I'll be living in the space  alone and my persona=
l/living area is separate from the open work area.<br /> <br /> The space h=
as great natural light, 3 large windows and East River views.  Exposed bric=
k and beams and wood floors. There's a 10' tall chalkboard  wall, small roo=
f deck for lounging or cigarette breaks, a full kitchen  and there's laundr=
y. Yeah, that's right throw a load in while after  effects or your tool/sof=
tware of choice chugs away on some project. I've  also got a small, separat=
e living room or as it's called in work speak a  "lounge." There's wifi cab=
le internet, a french press and a moderate  collection of vinyl for listeni=
ng to music sans computer.<br /> <br /> It's 3 blocks from the East River f=
erry, 10 minutes down Broadway from  the Marcy JMZ ,15 minute walk from the=
 Bedford L and a half block from  the Kent Ave. bike lane. Bike racks are r=
ight outside the building.<br /> <br /> Marlowe & Sons and Diner - the offi=
cial Williamsburg hipster gift  shop/coffee shop/restaurant is a block away=
- convenient for savory yet  expensive treats and coffee. Also convenient f=
or informal business  meetings or awkward conversations in public with your=
 ex. There's also  an Italian restaurant on the bottom floor and a funky st=
reet art gallery  right next door. The building houses a mix of creative/de=
signer types.<br /> <br /> I'm a video maker/animator and looking for creat=
ive types to share the  space with. I'm NOT looking for producer/PR/executi=
ve types who's work  consists of negotiations and phone calls. I AM looking=
 for other  creative types of all stripes who make stuff: designers, illust=
rators,  writers, programmers, basket makers, animators, digital artists, e=
tc.  Unfortunately, I don't have the ventilation for painters and sculptors=
  so be creative but be non-toxic/clean air breathing. As I live in the  sp=
ace it's important that I can breathe at the end of the day.<br /> <br /> T=
he rent will be $575 and 25% of heat and electric each. I'll cover internet=
. Looking to get people in by mid-January.<br /><br /> <a style=3D"color: b=

 $400 per month, Long Island City, 300 sf, Art studio for share at Reis Stu=
dios<br /> Available: 01/15/2012<br /><br /> I'm a conceptual painter from =
Europe seeking a studio-mate to share my  space at Reis Art Studios in Long=
 Island City, starting January 15. My  studio space is 300 sq. ft. (21x12) =
with lofty 13 feet ceilings, perfect  for anyone working with large canvase=
s or stretchers. The walls are  painted white and the space is overall very=
 airy with great light, and I  prefer to keep it neat (and am hoping to fin=
d a studio mate who doesn't  mind keeping the space orderly). The studio in=
cludes a wood loft for  storage, a sink, a large window facing west with a =
beautiful view of New  York City and it is private (key access).  It's on t=
he fourth floor,  but the building has a reliable elevator, bathrooms on ev=
ery floor and a  carpentry room accessible on request.<br /> <br /> The stu=
dio is a short walk (one block) located one stop from Manhattan  on the E, =
M, G or 7 train (Court Square stop) in an up & coming  neighborhood with cu=
te restaurants and coffee shops. I have found the  other artists at Reis St=
udios to be supportive, collaborative and  overall a very inspirational com=
munity. The studio organizes open  studios from time to time if you're inte=
rested in showcasing your works  in progress. I'm asking for $400/month ren=
t, which includes wi-fi  internet and heat. I typically spend weekdays at t=
he studio and would  ideally like to find a studio-mate who prefers to work=

00 per month, Red Hook, 160 sf room in 1400 sf loft, One of two bedrooms in=
 creative sunny warehouse space.<br /> Available: Jan 1 through Negotiable<=
br /><br /> Looking to share a beautiful live + work space.  It's on the to=
p floor  of an old factory building; 17' ceilings and a full height window =
wall  with a stunning view of the harbor and manhattan & brooklyn  skylines=
.  Old refinished wood floors, simple modern kitchen and  bathroom.  There =
are two bedrooms tucked in the mezzanine floor  overlooking the main space =
-- my girlfriend and I are in one and the  other is available.  I'm an arch=
itect and Maria's an artist and  filmmaker - we're in our mid-twenties, bot=
h busy and creative people,  always working on one project or another.  <br=
 /> <br /> The loft is something of a work in progress, improving bit by bi=
t.  It's  a non-traditional setup -- we've mounted an industrial ladder on =
wheels  to access the bedrooms & made a pretty massive coffee table out of =
a  steel fire door, among other things -- and we'd love to find someone  si=
milarly open to a bit of oddness.  I work on bicycles so there's a few  of =
those about, along with Maria's projects occasionally, but we  generally ke=
ep things pretty organized. One whole wall is built-in  storage cubbies and=
 shelves, of which several are available.  Wireless  and all utilities are =
included. Kitchen and cleaning supplies are  provided.  So is a projector f=
or watching gigantic films on the wall.  <br /> <br /> The building is fant=
astic -- full of writers and photographers and  artists and musicians, with=
 laundry on the floor and a great super and a  common courtyard for vegetab=
les and barbecuing and whatever, and a  rooftop to boot.  Red Hook is wonde=
rful and weird, still mostly off the  beaten track and all the better for i=
t.  Great bars, great food, great  creative energy.  <br /> <br /> The buil=
ding's on Coffey Park; it's a 10 minute walk over the newly  opened pedestr=
ian bridge to the F and G and a 10-min walk to Fairway,  the harbor and Ste=
ve's Key Lime pies.<br /> <br /> No smokers or live-in significant others p=
lease.  Love dogs but would  probably prefer to keep em outside the home.  =
We'd like to find someone  who's as excited about the space and neighborhoo=
d as we are, can keep  things reasonably orderly and be respectful -- the p=
lace feels huge but  it's still more or less one communal shared area, so b=
eing considerate  and easygoing is important.  <br /> <br /> We spend most =
of the time we're home cooking, drinking, reading,  watching movies, & work=
ing. Both have jobs that keep late nights  mostly to a minimum.  I think we=
'll be renting the space month-to-month,  so only one month's rent up front=
 is required, and a longer stay is  negotiable.<br /> <br /> There are 10 p=
hotos here and a few more at the website linked at the bottom.<br /><br /> =

 It is located on E. 14th  St below Ave H in BK. The apt. is completely fur=

ok in Manhattan.  His schedule is 3-11p Fri-Tues. <br /> <br /> The rent is=
 $900/month, $1800 at move in to cover last month. This is a  long term sub=
let, the owner is gone one year and a half for work.  Ideally I am looking =
for someone who can make at least a 6 month  commitment, but that is negoti=
able. <br /> <br /> The bedroom is West facing and gets good evening light.=
 It has a bed, closet, two dressers, and desk. <br /> <br /> The kitchen is=
 stocked with pots and pans, utensils, and plates and  bowls, as well as ev=
erything else you need for a functioning kitchen. As  you can see in the ph=
otos, the apt. is completely furnished from top to  bottom. <br /> <br /> U=
tilities are NOT included in the monthly rent, but usually don't exceed  $8=
0/month total and will be split between the two tenants. That  includes the=
 bill for high speed internet, which comes with the apt. <br /> The apt. is=
 one block from the Q train on Ave H, so the commute into  Manhattan is a s=
traight shot, usually about 25-30 min. to Canal which is  the first stop in=

Super easy to get  to Williamsburg, Manhattan, etc.    <br /> <br /> There =
are lots of restaurants around (Myrtle Ave has opened up a ton of  new stuf=

gas on the block.  There are 3 grocery stores besides the  really close one=
 in walking distance and the farmer's market on  Saturday's is at Fort Gree=

st and last months rent plus $850 security  deposit for move in).  The land=
lady lives in the building and is really  cool.  She receives all mail beca=

egular mail.<br /> This is an amazing deal for the right person, as it's a =
way to have a  large bedroom and a separate large studio all in the same ap=
artment,  which is super rare these days.  It's important for me to find th=
e right  person.  So far,  relaxed female artists have been the kind of per=
son  who has worked out the best, so something in that basic formula is wha=

 My beloved roommate is leaving the country. I'm very sad. Nevertheless,  w=

le person to take over her room (earthy looking one, see  attachments). Ava=
ilable mid. January or February 1st, 2012. It is a  spacious sized room wit=
h high ceilings in a new 2 bdr. apt in  Brooklyn-Lefferts Garden area aka F=
latbush. Optional to take furnished  (bed, desk, shelf, dresser), or unfurn=
ished. Double-slide doors sized  closet is integrated. The room has lots of=
 light. The apt. is on the  ground floor, and was transformed by us to a co=
lorful, cozy creative  factory. <br /> <br /> 2.5 blocks away from the Q tr=
ain, Parkside Ave. stop, and a 25 min. ride  into Manhattan (Union Square).=
 Groceries, laundry, stores, restaurants,  and New York City's 2nd biggest =
green spot Prospect Park are also all  within 1, 2 min. walking distance. I=
 run my business from the office in  the living room. That's why our home i=
s always, and at all times clean,  and neat. We are constantly punctual wit=
h rent payments. Therefore: We  want to find somebody like-minded! <br /> <=
br /> The lease ends end of September 2012, but if I get everything straigh=
t  with my renewal of the "Extraordinary Artist Visa O1" papers, I'll  cons=
ider to renew it for another year. <br /> <br /> The monthly rent is 950 US=
D, utilities (wi-fi, electricity, gas) included. One month rent of security=
 requested to move in.<br /> <br /> Hello, good day. Maybe you know someone=

a great Super Market with organic produce a block  away, as well as Starbuc=

the 2/3 train as well.<br /> <br /> The apartment is already furnished, so =
this apartment is great for  someone who doesn't have many things with them=

 pets, or a couple. I'm  looking for a low-key responsible person, who woul=
