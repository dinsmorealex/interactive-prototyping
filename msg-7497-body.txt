$1,200.00 Per Month, Clinton Hill/Navy Yard, Brooklyn, Plenty Of Spaces A=
vailable In Beautiful Newly Renovated Bldg! Huge Range Of Sizes/Prices Av=
ailable!
Available: Aug 01, 2014

To anyone looking for a great new studio space to work in, I have been as=
ked to refer you to a friend's new project in the Clinton Hill/Navy Yard =
area. There are so many spaces available, it'd be impossible to describe =
them all.

The prices range anywhere from $300-$700 on the small to medium side, to =
around $1100-$1250 for the larger ones (perfect size for sharing). And th=
en there are the enormous, beautiful spaces with massive windows, exposed=
 brick, and other perks. These range anywhere from $1250 - $2000

All 4 sides of the building have windows, so aside from the interior ones=
, each space will have plenty of light and ventilation. The building will=
 have central heat and AC, and a private slop sink in each space (at no e=
xtra cost!)

The building also provides gorgeous rooftop views, 24 hour access and sec=
urity, and an enormous loading dock and freight elevator.

For those not familiar with the area, it's generally thought of as a safe=
, quiet Brooklyn neighborhood. The building is just a few blocks from the=
 G train, with plenty of food options and easy street parking.

If you're interested, please call or text Jordan. Thanks!

$800.00 Per Month, Greenwood / Sunset Park, Brooklyn, 1250 sq. ft., Photo=
/Video Studio for share
Available: Sept 01, 2014

Hello,
My name is Greg. I am a DP/Photographer and proprietor of a photo/video s=
tudio in Greenwood, BK, an up-and-coming arts district on the south side =
of Park Slope.

I am looking for a new person to share the studio with starting September=
 1st. My partner, who I established and built the studio with a little ov=
er 2 years ago, is moving. He will still be loosely associated with the s=
tudio, but no longer an active participant.

Rent for the share is $800/month.

Quick overview:
2 block from express D/N trains at 36th st/4th Ave stop  both trains only=
 make one stop in BK before hitting the city  very fast. The studio is th=
e entire 3rd floor, and part of the second floor of the building. No, it =
unfortunately doe not have an elevator, but this has not proven to be muc=
h of an issue.
Space:=20
1000 sq. ft. main interior space
1000 sq. ft. raw roof with private access
750 sq. ft. custom built deck out the back door of the 3rd floor
Dedicated hair, m/u, wardrobe room on the second floor
Equipment:
Strobe and Hot light packages
Grip
Backdrops, floordrops, seamless
iMac (for tethered shooting) and iPad

You can get more information, floor plans, equipment list, and see more p=
hotos on the website. Note, the website has not been updated since we too=
k over the second floor and rearranged.

I am at the studio most days with my dog, Ginger, as it is my office. I s=
ometimes do music nights on the deck with singer/songwriters or other per=
formers, and hourly/day rentals to other photographers from time to time.=


Looking for someone in the industry who will be a good fit  laid back, fl=
exible, into creative arts. I built the place myself to make a creative, =
inviting, and comfortable space. Everyone that comes for the first time s=
ays two things. One, Wow. Two, Can I live here? I say, thank you and no.

Im really hoping to find someone through network, instead of some random =
craigslist posting. If you, or someone you know, may be interested please=
 contact me directly by phone or email. Come on over and check it out.

Thank you,
Greg

Large, lovely art studio for share
Available: Aug 15, 2014

I'm moving out of my awesome studio - my loss is your gain! The available=
 space is 230sqft, one third of a much larger room, shared with an illust=
rator and jewelry maker/sculptor. This room is in turn one of three big r=
ooms in this huuuuge studio, the other two are occupied by a woodworker a=
nd a printmaker, who are both great. Everybody has pretty different sched=
ules so it's rare that there's more than two people in the studio at any =
one time. The space could be available August 15th or September 1st.

We have a shared kitchen area with fridge, toaster oven, kettle etc, and =
we have direct roof access which can be used for sanding / chemicals / sp=
ray paint / hanging out etc.=20

The space is perfectly suited for painters, sculptors, jewellers, illustr=
ators, textile artists, designers. . . really, anybody who wants somewher=
e to make work and needs space to spread out.=20

The space will be empty when you move in, a blank slate (the photo is of =
it with some of my stuff still in there!), but there's the chance to take=
 over some of the furniture if you'd like to. It's in a big old industria=
l building filled with artists studios. Has an elevator, freight elevator=
, daily usps &amp; FedEx pickups (!!! goodbye post office queues), 24h se=
curity, mail room, roof access. Wifi, of course. It's on Park Ave at Nost=
rand in Bed-Stuy / South Williamsburg.

 we're still excited to share a space with people who don't have four leg=
s and a tail. We have a lot of plants, including a bunch in a little aqua=
rium, and we like to watch movies or go out when we're not working 14 hou=
rs a day. We both work in film -- he makes pictures, she makes them prett=
ier.=20

$1,000.00 Per Month, Park Slope/Gowanus, Brooklyn, 1 Br in a 2 Br Apt ste=
ps from the Train
Available: Aug 15, 2014

This apartment is a great find and the location is unbeatable! It is righ=
t on the border between Park Slop and Gowanus and is ridiculously close t=
o the subway. The room I am renting can fit a queen size bed and has a de=
cent closet. I currently have it furnished with a dresser, desk, and a tw=
in sized bed but I can easily take some pieces out for you.

This apartment is a basement apartment with tile floors, so it is quite c=
ool during the summer months and requires minimum heat during the winter.=
 We have a backyard that is very quiet and the perfect place to hang out =
either by yourself or with some friends.  The only weird side to this apa=
rtment is the ceilings are a little lower than standard, meaning anyone o=
ver 6 will feel quite tall. However, for those of us not vertically bless=
ed, it is perfect!

Gas and water are included in the rent, so you will only have to pay elec=
tric and internet.=20

Both Park Slope and Gowanus feature tons of restaurants and shops. This a=
partment is two stops away from Barclay Center and the Atlantic Terminal =
Mall and minutes from Prospect Park and a Whole Foods!

Unfortunately, there is a no pet policy since I am allergic to most anima=
ls.

I am looking for a year-long flat mate although I will consider shorter c=
ontracts. I am a female who is a dresser and costume designer who mainly =
stays home at night, but does enjoy going out for drinks. I would love so=
meone who likes to keep their apartment quiet and who enjoys hanging out,=
 sharing a laugh and maybe having small dinner parties from time to time.=
 Oh, cleanliness is a must!

$1,350.00 Per Month, Gowanus, Brooklyn, 900 sq. ft., Oct 1st room for ren=
t in Gowanus
Available: Oct 01, 2014

Beginning October 1st, I'm renting out the other half of my 2br/1ba apart=
ment for $1,350 a month and a flexible 6 month to 1 year lease.=20

The $1,350 rent includes: all utilities, high speed internet, and a clean=
ing service once a month. To secure the room, I am requesting first month=
s rent, last months rent and 1 month security (that you will get back upo=
n good condition at move out).=20

The apartment:
The apartment is newly refurbished (2013) with new appliances, cabinets, =
and hardwood floors. The bedroom and living room are yours, and the kitch=
en and bathroom are shared with me. The two bedrooms are on opposite ends=
, with a kitchen/dining area and two living rooms separating them. The ki=
tchen is fairly large, and it is equipped with all the standard appliance=
s. Beyond the kitchen is your living room, and beyond that is my living r=
oom and bedroom (railroad style with a curtain separator). The bedrooms a=
re small (9x6) with no closet space, but has a large window and extra hig=
h ceilings. Your room is in the back of the house so you won't have stree=
t noise.=20

There's an outdoor patio with a nice place to chill on the Astroturf and =
under an umbrella with a nice view of Dumbo. The bathroom is located off =
of my living room. It is small, but nice with storage. It has a full-size=
 tub and shower. You'll have a shelf for your toiletries.

The apartment comes furnished or unfurnished. For $800 you can get it ful=
ly furnished (twin size bed and frame, desk, A/C window unit, sleeper sof=
a, small Smart TV, bookshelf, garment rack) or you can buy stuff from me =
a la carte as I will be selling everything separately.

The building:=20
I am on the 2nd floor up one flight of stairs in a split-level duplex wit=
h 2 guys living above me and a woodworking/construction company below.=20=


Subways/Transport:
It is the best place for subway access - 2 blocks from the Union St R, 3 =
blocks from the Carroll St F &amp; G, less than a mile from Atlantic Barc=
lay's terminal (B, Q, N, R, 2, 3, 4, 5, lirr) and Hoyt - Schermerhorn (A,=
 C, G).=20

The neighborhood:=20
&quot;Up and coming&quot; Gowanus less than a block away from a park, com=
munity pool, Proteus Gowanus Art Gallery, Ample Hills Ice Cream, and Shuf=
fleboard Bar. The block itself is still pretty industrial and near a lot =
of auto-body shops and warehouses but in between Carroll Gardens, Boerum =
Hill, and Park Slope, with plenty of restaurants, gyms, event spaces, bar=
s, coffee shops, shopping, laundry, and grocery stores within an easy wal=
king distance.=20

The space:=20
This is a safe space. Queer-friendly, no racists, sexists, or homophobes.=
 I am looking for the obvious roommate: a respectful, considerate, and ea=
sy-going person who is clean, responsible, and pays rent on-time.

About me:=20
I'm a Web Designer in my late-twenties. I have a flexible work schedule a=
nd I am either traveling, working from home, or working from my office in=
 Manhattan. Clean and laid-back.

Sunny and very large 400sq ft apartment in the heart of Williamsburg's No=
rthside, right off the Bedford Ave L train stop - literally 10 steps away=
. This is a 1 bedroom space with a private living room in a 2 bedroom apt=
 where the bathroom and kitchen are the only shared areas.

 Space:
- 1 150sqft bedroom with a rear facing window that gets afternoon sunligh=
t

- Last Months rent $1800

The apartment is basically two apartments that share a kitchen and bathro=
om(these are accessed from the living room that is part of the space that=
 is for rent.) However, I work Mon-Fri 9-6 - with an active social life t=
he rest of the time - and am very quiet and neat person when there, so th=
e space is very, very private.=20

 I would prefer a roommate that does not work from home, this is a home n=
ot an office. No pets at this time. Please be employed(or otherwise gainf=
ully funded) and able to pay the full monthly costs by the first of the m=
onth, otherwise this will not work.=20

 Me: 31, Male, work a corporate job, quiet at home, practice yoga and hea=
lthy living, very tidy and respectful. Ideally I am looking for some one =
similar, I do not host large parties or gatherings and consider my home t=
o be a space for quiet relaxation and restoration.

 The rental terms would be a 3 month trial basis and then month to month =
- though hopefully when we meet or speak we will have a good idea of if i=
t will work for both of us.

$1,490.00 Per Month, East Village, New York, East village apt with tons o=
f storage
Available: Sept 01, 2014 through Jun 30, 2015

I am renting my 1 bedroom in this 2 bedroom 1 bath apartment in the East =
Village. The Apt is located on 11th Between A and B. I have to go because=
 I got a job somewhere else, or else I'd probably stay in this apartment =
forever. The apartment will be available Sept 1st and the least ends June=
 2015.=20

About the Apartment
It is a walk up in a charming pre-war building. Apt is on the 5th floor. =
The apartment itself took a lot of planning, as most apartments in the ea=
st village are tiny, but I think we did a good job of curating the furnit=
ure with the lay out. That being said, I think we lucked out because the =
apartment is larger than average places in the area and the rooms are on =
opposite sides of the apartment, which allows for tons of privacy. Note t=
hat this is the East Village so you won't have expansive bedrooms, but yo=
u have enough room for a nightstand, queen sized bed and a desk or dresse=
r. As you can see in the photos, the apartment is furnished. The room can=
 be furnished, but that is something we'd have to discuss.=20

 Note that the storage is built in, so you will have literally 3 times mo=
re storage than most places in Manhattan.=20

The room gets tons of light. I'm sad to see it go. I've lived in a lot of=
 apartments, and this has been my favorite.=20

About the roommate=20
He's a 30 y/o male architect. He's the live and let live type. I've known=
 him for over 10 years. He's polite, respectful, and most importantly qui=
et/ keeps to himself. He spends most of his time at work or in his room. =
All he really asks is 1) if you are having a group of people over let him=
 know in advance and 2) clean up after yourself in the common areas. Whil=
e we typically have separate lives, we often times go to bbqs, concerts o=
r drink together.=20

About you
Preferably a professional who likes to go out but doesn't always bring th=
e party home. Just be respectful and clean up after yourself. No male or =
female preference. I will, however, require first, last and security depo=
sit. The room can be furnished at a negotiable and fair rate.

$1,200.00 Per Month, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, Beautiful room in Greenpoint!
Available: Oct 01, 2014

Hello! My roommates moving to Europe at the end of September, so were loo=
king for someone to take over his room in our 2-bedroom in Greenpoint. We=
 live on the 3rd floor of a 3-story walk-up with an attentive landlord an=
d friendly, quiet tenants. Its less than 5 minutes to the Nassau G and mu=
ltiple bus lines, and a 10-minute walk to the Bedford L. Very close to la=
undry, bars, grocery stores, coffee shops  basically anything you need. T=
he common space has an open kitchen, large marble countertops, and double=
-height ceilings with skylights; beyond a table, desk, pictures and plant=
s, weve kept the furnishings sparse, but theres more than enough space fo=
r additional furniture.=20

About the room: The open room is approximately 10x15, with great sunlight=
, multiple inset shelves, and a large closet space just outside. It overl=
ooks a private backyard, so it's sunny but quiet in the morning. My roomm=
ate currently has a queen-size bed, dresser and desk in the room with eno=
ugh space left over to work comfortably on his large-format paintings.=20=


About me: Im 30/M and work full-time as a freelance arts writer/editor. I=
 often work from home, but Im out most evenings attending openings, doing=
 studio visits, or whatever else. As a roommate, Im clean and easygoing, =
and I dont have people over to the place very often, so you wont have to =
worry about it getting too loud or crowded. In my current situation, weve=
 done a good job of making our place feel like a home  peaceful, comforta=
ble, etc.  and thats something Id hope to continue.=20

About you: Im looking for someone who is (a) employed full-time, (b) does=
nt work from home, and (c) able to commit to a 12-month lease. Im not at =
all particular about living with men or women, gay/straight/whatever  all=
 that really matters is that we get along and that, as a roommate, youre =
as friendly, courteous, and responsible as I try to be.

Rent Agreement: The landlord requires proof of full-time employment (pays=
tubs or copy of contract(s)), as well as anything else that demonstrates =
financial stability (credit score, bank statement, co-signer agreement, e=
tc.). He also asks for one months rent ($1200) up front as security depos=
it. The utilities (internet, gas, and electric) usually run somewhere aro=
und $70 per month. Sorry, but no pets.=20

Im looking to find someone sooner rather than later, so if youre interest=
ed, drop me a line and well set up a time for you to come see the place a=
nd talk a bit=20

ember 1, 2014.  The room is quite spacious at 9 x 19. the apartment is on=
 the third floor, with access to the roof.  The view of the southern tip =
of Manhattan is stunning. One of the best features of this apartment is t=
he bright sunlight, and beautiful colors you can see from the windows and=
 mini skylights.  Located about 1 block from the docks of the Brooklyn Ma=
rine Terminal, this place is unique and has a definite nautical charm.=20=

This is my fifth year at this apartment, and I really adore the remote, s=
tep away from all of the gentrification of Court and Smith Streets. The B=
rooklyn Bridge Park  and ferry to Governor's Island is just a few blocks =
away.=20
Some people consider this area Red Hook, or Columbia Heights, but it is t=
ruly the Brooklyn Waterfront.  The F/G trains are a 11 minute walk away, =
and the B61 bus runs down the block.  There are some small convenience st=
ores a couple of blocks away, and the closest Met food is just 4 blocks a=
way.  Fairway is about 1 1/4 miles down in Red Hook, and Union market is =
also nearby.  The laundromats are a few blocks away. There is room outsid=
e for bike locking. =20
The average utilities run about $70 each most of the year, and about $120=
 in the summer.  The landlord covers heat and hot water. It is very quiet=
 here at night.  During the day, you will hear some trucking and standard=
 daytime work noises.=20
I am a 39 year old painter. My cat is 9 years old.  I  kindly prefer that=
 she is the only pet in this apartment.  I make visual displays in midtow=
n during the week.  I usually leave for work around 8, and come back arou=
nd 7 or so.  I rarely work on weekends. =20
I am a quiet person by nature, I like to watch movies at home sometimes, =
or cook a nice meal from time to time. I love my job, but it is physical,=
 so I often recharge at home on the weeknights.  I am an extremely chille=
d out person, and I enjoy keeping the place in order, especially in our s=
hared spaces.  In my opinion, this promotes optimism and moving forward. =
 I do not want to live with someone who is too busy to chip in on the cle=
aning.  I am looking for someone who will speak up if there is a problem =
with anything, rather than sit in passive silence. There is no cigarette =
smoking inside the apartment.=20
I look forward to meeting you and giving you a tour of my home, which cou=
ld be ours.

$1,066.00 Per Month, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Room from September 1st in 3=
-bed with shared home office/studio
Available: Sept 01, 2014

We have an unfurnished room opening up in our 3-bedroom apartment on
Williamsburg's South Side from September 1st.

Your roommates will be a 27-year old woman who works in documentary film,=
 and a 31-year old woman who is a marketing manager for a theater company=
,  both of whom are nice, and one of whom is me.

We're on the second floor of a four-floor walk-up, a three- or
four-minute walk to the Marcy Ave JMZ and a six- or seven-minute walk
to the Lorimer L and G trains, and near an exponentially growing
abundance of cafes, restaurants, bars and the like.

The apartment is quiet, kept pretty clean and tidy and gets good
light; we have turned the fourth room into a sort of home
office/studio, which you would be welcome to share. (We are also open
to swapping the home office with what is currently the bedroom if you
prefer -- the &quot;office&quot;; room is a bigger room, only it gets a
fair bit less light.) A big plus if you're bringing in furniture, since o=
ur current roommate will be taking a lot of it with him.

To move in, we would need from you the first month's rent ($1,066) and
your share of the deposit ($1,000); utilities are split three ways. We ar=
e looking for someone who preferably would want to jump in the lease with=
 us in October. No pets, unfortunately. If you're interested, please writ=
e back, tell us
a little about yourself, and let us know if you have any other
questions.

**Please note that my roommate, who had most of the furniture, recently m=
oved out. The common spaces are now only sparsely furnished. Since we had=
 very similar taste in home decor, I thought that the pictures I posted w=

nce I have time to give the apartment more attention.

 restaurants and Prospect Park is a 10 minute bike ride away. I really li=
ke the neighborhood and location.

The larger bedroom is 160 square feet, has 3 bay windows facing the stree=
t, a closet and can fit a full size bed, large desk, dresser and still ha=
s plenty of space to move. The room is unfurnished and can come with a bo=
ng if you are into that sort of thing. Rent is $1100 for this room with a=
 deposit of $1100. One of my roommates is selling his full size bed, whic=
h could fit comfortably in either room.

Storage space in the basement!!

I am 31, from California, mellow and looking for roommates who are clean,=
 courteous and want a peaceful home. Clean. Please. It would be really gr=
eat if they/you have a sense of humor too. I am an artist and work for a =
photographer in the city. I also have a couple of freelance jobs so my sc=
hedule can vary. I am nice, respect privacy and space, joke around a lot,=
,, I like to cook, don't have any food issues and care about the home bei=
ng a pleasant environment. I have lived in this apartment for a year and =
am bummed to see my roommates go. Especially the dog..
I'm allergic to cats.

Most of the furniture in the apartment will be taken away, except for the=
 couch and kitchen table. I'm looking forward to getting the desk out of =
the living room to open up the space and get rid of the clutter. (If you =
have a couch or other furniture, I am open to swapping things out.)

Thank you I really like living here!!

$1,650.00 Per Month, East Village, New York, Large, sunny room - great ap=
t. Incredible convenience.
Available: Sept 01, 2014

I'm looking for one roommate to fill a room in a 3 bedroom East Village a=
pt. This bedroom is on the corner of the building so its pretty large (ab=
out 180 sq ft) and has a lot of windows. Plenty of space to fit a bed, a =
couch, and a desk. Hopefully, this is one of those apts that would spoil =
future apts for you. Its kinda like having your own small studio, just sh=
aring a pretty sweet kitchen and bathroom.

The apt is 2nd floor walkup. The eat-in kitchen is a great communal space=
, and the full bathroom is shared between all 3 roommates. The other 2 ro=
ommates are early 30s guys: an advertising copywriter (myself) and a tale=
nted app developer. We're both pretty busy and like to have a decent, rel=
axing, quiet place when we aren't busy being busy.

Looking for a roommate that fits the usual bill: easy-going, clean, matur=
e, stable. But really hoping to find someone that fits the great vibe of =

The apartment is a railroad scenario, big at that.  And don't be turned o=
ff by the word railroad! This apartment is pretty unique being that every=
 room has a window. So like the room you'd be subletting, sunlight is eve=
rywhere. The living room is  super cozy and chalk full of amenities.  The=
 kitchen is fully functioning and the bathroom is very clean.   And of co=
urse, there is full-on high speed Wifi.

More on me -- I am a musician/sound engineer with transient work and stud=
io hours outside of the apartment.  I am  incredibly respectful of others=
. That said, I'd expect the same in return. =20

Again, the apartment is just a block from the Dekalb L train.  Both the M=
 and J/Z trains are in walking distance as well.

Disclaimers -- aside from the bed, most of the furniture in the photos fo=
r the bedroom for sublet will be gone.  There is a possibility the room w=
ill be available after the September!  No smokers please... at least indo=
ors.

$850.00 Per Month, South Slope, Brooklyn, Spacious Bedroom in Artist Loft=
, South Slope Brooklyn
Available: Sept 21, 2014 through Oct 20, 2014

I am an artist traveling to Turkey for a month. I have a spacious, cozy, =
comfortable bedroom available for sublet in a two-story loft apartment in=
 the heart of South Slope, BK. I am looking to rent the apartment from Se=
pt 21st - October 19th/20th, exact dates can be flexible.

The apartment is a built-out artist loft on the 4th floor of a large ware=
house building. There is no elevator, so look forward to buns and legs of=
 steel with your new built-in workout routine.  An amazing roof gives inc=
redible views of lower Manhattan and the Statue of Liberty (plus the best=
 sunsets this side of the Hudson). The apartment has loads of sunlight, w=
ell-outfitted kitchen, and wonderful, easy-going roommates.=20

You will be living with two couples, all working professionals in their m=
id-late twenties - an artist fabricator, an architect, a fashion designer=
, and a photographer that travels often for work.  Everyone is friendly, =
laid-back and professional.  A truly great group of people, you couldn't =
ask for better roommates.  There is plenty of room and there is rarely mo=
re than 2 people home at any given time. There is only one bathroom, but =
this hasn't been a problem, as long as communication is open.

Excellent location and neighborhood, with great bars and restaurants righ=
t downstairs.  Some great coffee shops, a grocery store, the laundromat, =
and liquor store are all on your block, as well. Greenwood Cemetery (alon=
g with the highest point in Brooklyn) is a 5 min walk, and Prospect Park =
is only 15 min away by foot.

as a shoe rack and space for bikes. The living room is large with hardwoo=
d floors and a big bay window that brightens up the room.=20
The kitchen is spacious and has a dishwasher, sink, refrigerator, toaster=

 another is an international student who additionally speaks French and G=
erman. Everyone is pretty easy going, clean, responsible, and respectful.=
 It's a very friendly household and every once in awhile they like to coo=
k a meal together or get a drink, but for most the part everyone's doing =
their own thing. The house is kept tidy and everyone has a weekly cleanin=
g duty to keep it that way. They're looking for somebody who is also easy=
 going, clean, responsible, respectful, and will pay rent on time. 420/sm=
oker and lgbt friendly but no dogs or cats.=20

le Foods are just a few train stops away, and a fifteen minute walk can g=

e at extremely low prices (I've bought a lb of organic strawberries there=
 for a dollar!). Local food places include Scratch Bread, Colador Cafe, D=
ough, Sushi K, and Speedy Romeo's. The closest subway stop is the Bedford=
-Nostrand G and the B48, B44, B54, and B38 all run nearby which can easil=
y get you to places such as Downtown Brooklyn or the Botanical Gardens.=20=

This place is truly a delight. The apartment is spacious and well laid ou=

 has harbored couples before, and I'd be welcome to a couple moving in. T=
here is one other room in the apartment occupied by a fun and loving coup=
le who are respectful and friendly. Downstairs from the apartment there i=
s an art studio that is well equipped with all kinds of tools and table s=
pace. To name a few of the tools, we have a bandsaw, miter saw, lathe, ta=
ble saw, 3d printer, cnc cutter/plotter, welder, sewing machine, screen p=
rinting set up, and much more. The other great thing about the studio is =
it connects to a large backyard. The backyard has an outdoor workstation,=
 a beautiful mulberry tree, a couple big planters, and a modest but often=
 used bbq grill. The neighborhood couldn't be better. It's quiet but clos=
e to fun things, and has a quaint and friendly vibe.=20

The utilities are included in the price, and month to month is fine as lo=
ng as you can give a months notice before leaving.=20

Available: Aug 15, 2014 through Aug 15, 2015

We have one second-floor apartment available in our lovely home off the D=
ekalb Stop. We have restored the original oak flooring, brought back most=
 of the details and installed a new kitchen. The original tin ceilings ar=
e 10ft high and there is a stairwell to the roof, which has an incredible=
 view of Manhattan. We have put a lot of thought and energy into everythi=
ng from the hall lights to the plants in the backyard.
It is about 1200 sq feet with four bedrooms- 2 large/2 smaller. Each bedr=
oom has a real window, the apts can be configured in many different ways =
i.e. art studio with bedroom/extra living room/guest room/etc..=20

The house is located 4 blocks from the L Train Dekalb stop off St. Nichol=
as Avenue (and 5 blocks from the M Train Myrtle stop) on a quiet, tree-li=
ned street. We are 8 blocks from the Jefferson stop, our main source of r=
eally cool bars and restaurants and excellent coffee, but the Dekalb is s=
lowly coming along.

Price for two tenants is $2800/mo while 3 tenants the rent must be $3000.=
 There is no broker fee, but we will need first months rent and security =
deposit as well as a short description of yourselves/renting history. Ref=
errals and/or guarantors would be great. As we live in the first floor di=
rectly below, were looking for no more than three people, hopefully who a=
re self-aware of their own volume...

The apartment is not vacant until August 15th, which is why we have photo=
s from last year. We are happy to start showing from the 15th onwards whi=
le we're doing some touchups.

$280,000.00 Per Month, Dutchess County, NY, Bangall, 3000 sq. ft., The pe=

Available: Jul 31, 2014

This charming 1840s farmhouse is in the small hamlet of Bangall, NY, in D=
utchess County, less than a 2 hour drive from Manhattan. It sits on 6 mos=
tly wooded acres. Kitchen, living room, den, 2 bedrooms (1 big, 1 small),=
 1 &amp; 1/2 baths, a large studio suitable for an artist or writer or bo=
th, porch, large workroom with washer/dryer, garage, large attic for stor=
age, a shed also for storage. Conveniently located between Bard and Vassa=
r it is also a great place for a professor. There is a large barn on the =
property which needs renovation but will make a spectacular studio. The h=
ouse is not fancy but it's structurally sound (build on bedrock) and thou=
gh it could use work one could move in and do nothing to it if they choos=
e. There is also a very big old gazebo with arts &amp; crafts detail that=
 needs work but could be a great outdoor space.  The town of Bangall is i=
n walking distance with a great cafe and takeout, daily baked breads and =
more. The house is about 7 minutes from the town of Millbrook, NY, 10 min=
utes from Pine Plains, 20 minutes to Rhinebeck or Red Hook. There are ama=
zing restaurants everywhere, plus the best farm stand in the area is few =
minutes away with local produce, cheeses, breads, meats, all organic and =
amazing. I am an artist and writer and have lived here for 10 years, made=
 many paintings &amp; drawings in the space, written and published 5 nove=
ls and several anthologies. I don't mean to go all California but this pl=
ace has great karma. I am only leaving because my personal life has chang=
ed radically.=20

 created from a former steam fitter's shop with lovely gardens.
Available: Sept 01, 2014

We are selling our live/work home in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, just minute=
s from downtown Providence, Rhode Island School of Design and Brown campu=
ses, Hope Artist Village, farmer's markets and unique shopping and dining=
. There is parking for four cars, the bus stop is at the end of the block=
 and it is only minutes to commuter rail and Amtrak.

Over the past eight years we have transformed a former steam fitter's sho=
p into an ideal home and work space. It is currently configured as a one =
bedroom, two and a half bath home and studio, but it could easily accommo=
date additional bedrooms. The space could be reconfigured in a variety of=
 ways due to the open plan of the building.

Features of the property include two 7'x7' pyramid skylights, wood and re=
finished concrete floors, a new roof, windows and doors, french doors to =
a large patio, established perennial gardens including a privacy stand of=
 bamboo, stainless steel appliances, washer/dryer, and unique built-ins f=
rom the building's former life. A favorite item is an original 4'x10' woo=
d table that is the centerpiece of the studio space. There is a new 10'x1=
2' wood shed and all of this sits on a quarter acre lot.

Available: Sept 01, 2014 through Dec 31, 2014

Greetings!=20
Paige Sunrise here.=20

I am attending an intensive Graphic Design course at the Shillington scho=
ol in midtown from September 1 to December 31st. I am looking for a brigh=
t, joyful, inspiring space that can be nourishing and happy after concent=
rating on design projects all day.=20

I am a entrepreneur and own 2 business already. I was born and raised in =
New York (right on the Hudson River outside of the city) but have been li=
ving and working in Austin, Texas (I still have a house there), Portland =
Oregon, San Miguel Mexico, and Barcelona Spain. I have also lived on the =
upper east side for college and in the West Village 2 summers ago. My fam=
ily still lives in the New York aarea (including my Mom!) so it will be r=
eally nice to be back in the area while I attend the Shillington.

I have worked in the nonprofit world as well as the outdoor and adventure=
 scene for about 10 years (I used to be a professional trainer and Scuba =
Dive Instructor).  Now, I am taking everything I learned about inspiring =
and leading communities and using it to fuel and focus my art. I'll be co=
ncentrating on building my design portfolio in NYC.=20

I am an avid traveler. Seeing the world fuels me. I love cooking, but kee=
p my everyday meals pretty simple. I eat mostly raw/vegan, but being arou=
nd meat does not bother me. Shopping at local farmers markets is my favor=
ite. I am an avid runner who also likes to sit still and meditate. Oh, an=
d I am 30! Being 30 amazing.=20

My home space is really important to me as it is always the spot where I =
power up in order to go back into the world wide eyed and ready. I keep t=
hings very clean and organized.=20

Please reach out if you think I might be a good fit for sharing a home sp=
ace.=20

$800.00 Per Month, Kensington, Ditmas, Prospect Lefferts Gardens, Crown H=
eights, Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, Queer Female Writer/Political Type Lo=
oking for a Room
Available: Aug 15, 2014

If you have an open room and you're looking for someone who is:
-organized and pretty clean but doesn't get too intense about it
-both flexible and responsible in making communal/individual arrangements=
 around chores, shared food, etc.
-likes to be social but won't have large groups over all the time
-is likely to cook you an awesome meal from time to time
then we should talk!=20

A bit more about me: 31/F. I have a 10-6 job with a non-profit that I am =
very proud of; we work on improving civic engagement in local government =
with the goal of reducing inequity and building more democratic communiti=
es. Outside of that I'm trying to move various creative writing projects =
forward. At home I tend to spend a lot of time reading/writing, and other=
wise I'm out at readings, or at the park, biking about, trying to spend t=
ime with the vast number of amazing people here in New York.

I have to move out of my current space in Crown Heights (which I found on=
 the Listings Project!) because all my wonderful dancing roommates are mo=
ving on to new projects (and they're hiking the rent a fair amount). I'm =
hoping to stay within a short bike/walk to Prospect Park, and to find ano=
ther queer friendly, warm space.

Other relevant notes: I have a queen bed I'd like to keep if possible, so=
 a room that accomodates that would be really exciting. My exact move-in =
date is flexible, though I should be out of my current space by September=
 1st. I'm open to something that begins earlier than that.

$1,000.00 Per Month, Brooklyn, Greenpoint/Bushwick/Williamsburg, etc., Ma=
ture Writing Instuctor/Poet Seeking Quiet, Mature Living Space
Available: Aug 28, 2014

Hello. My name is Geoffrey Bankowski.

I currently live in Greenpoint, Brooklyn and am looking for a quiet, clea=
n, and mature living situation. By this I mean a thoughtful sharing of sp=
ace, clear and transparent communication regarding bills and any issues t=
hat might arise, etc.

Im in my upper 30s, work full time, and also teach writing classes at Hun=
ter College and work freelance for HarperCollins. I have an MFA in poetry=
, and have spent my almost seven years in NYC (originally from Michigan) =
engaged with writing and making hand-torn paper collage (geoffreybankowsk=
i.com) (Fear not: no messy art space or drama).=20

I am a very clean, organized person, but not neurotic about it. As we kno=
w, in NYC space is at a premium, and when it gets cluttered or dirty, its=
 just not as nice to come home to. Plus, I believe in beautiful surroundi=
ngs (light, plants, art, etc.). I'm very considerate of others' space bec=
ause, well, it's the right thing to do.=20

I enjoy good conversations and genuine social interaction, but don't need=
 it all the time and like and need quiet time to work or read or watch as=
 many documentary films as is possible. My interests span from the myster=
ies of deep space or deep sea to psychology to the beauty of a good bridg=
e to what effect talking to my plants really has to really good loose-lea=
f tea to building bookcases to practicing yoga to all types of thoughtful=
 music.=20

Frankly, I expect this might be difficult to find in my price range. I do=
 need a bit of space--either a sizeable room or some of the common space-=
-for a few pieces (said bookcases, a work table, a vintage file cabinet u=
sed as dresser, etc.). But it would be great to add to or help create a c=
alm, aesthetically pleasing space in which to both rest and work creative=
ly.=20

I am certainly open to changing neighborhoods for the right place. Certai=
n southern parts of Queens, or a bit farther south in Brooklyn. I do ride=
 my bike to work daily over the Williamsburg Bridge, so something allowin=
g that or one of the others would be important.=20

Thank you for your time. Please let me know if you think I might be a goo=
d fit for your space. Best of luck regardless.

We're looking for a two bedroom apartment with a reasonable sized kitchen=
 (at least by Manhattan standards) with an oven, stove-top and refrigerat=
or and some degree of natural light (for cooking and indoor photography).=
 A common area would be amazing, since I definitely don't have one now! I=
 have a minimal amount of furniture that I plan on moving with me (dresse=
rs and a desk), so definite plus points if there's already furniture! We =
are both considerate, clean, and way too quiet for our age :)=20

I'm looking for something with accessibility to the AC and 1 subway lines=
. My job is located in midtown right by the 1 stop.=20

I'm also open to subletting for 3-4 months. Dates are negotiable, but we'=
re pretty set on moving on September 1st.

Let me know if you can arrange a viewing, and I'm looking forward to movi=
ng!

And my flat is beautiful, full of light, clean, the building is old, but =
therein lies its charm. I live alone but i'm sure that two people will be=

Y
Available: Sept 01, 2014 through Dec 31, 2014

Lakeside house available to swap for September, October, November and Dec=
ember. 3 month swap would be ideal but shorter swaps of 2 weeks plus are =
a possibility. The house is located in Connemara in the West of Ireland o=
verlooking a lake surrounded by mountains. Atlantic ocean and beaches nea=
r by. Ideal for a creative or someone who needs time away to work on a pr=
oject. Or if you just want to explore the West of Ireland outside of the =
high tourist season. Looking to swap for a 2 bedroom apartment ideally (a=
lthough 1 bedrooms will also be considered) in Manhattan or Brooklyn. Hig=
hly recommended to visit in September as the weather can be really nice a=
nd the nearest town has a great arts festival !http://clifdenartsweek.ie =
.The house doesn't have a purpose built art studio but we could easily ma=
ke a messy area that could be used as a painting/art work space. The kitc=
hen is huge with great natural light and could be ideal. I am a visual ar=
tist in New York for the next 4 months for an art project and residency. =
I am in the city so we can meet up face to face if you are interested. Th=
e house comfortably sleeps 6, and you are more than welcome to have other=
 guests come vista while you stay. Any questions at all fell free to ask.=
