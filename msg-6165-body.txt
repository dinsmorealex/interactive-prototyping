 MacLean Fisher '08  and  Michael Fleisch '09  turned the passion for photography that they developed at Skidmore into a creative new business. Cecelia Gallery [ http://ceciliagallery.com ]  is a showcase for international photographers and a marketplace for high-quality camera straps crafted from Peruvian alpaca wool and Argentinian leather. The idea arose when Fleisch, a documentary filmmaker returning from a shoot in Peru, showed Fisher a hand-woven belt from there. Reinforced with nylon, the Cecelia straps are favored by  National Geographic  photographers, among others.
