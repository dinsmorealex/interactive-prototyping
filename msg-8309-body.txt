Dear Skidmore Graduate,

<strong>As Skidmore's Faculty Assessment Coordinator, I'm asking for your help.</strong>

Specifically, I'm inviting you to join our <strong>Alumni Learning Census</strong> and thereby help us to evaluate those aspects of the Skidmore education and experience that graduates find to be most and least helpful in their intellectual, personal, and professional development.

Only by closely examining real outcomes – the experiences of our graduates themselves – can the College fully gauge the quality and value of a Skidmore education after college.  That is why we have contracted with Fact Finders, Inc., an independent survey research firm located in Albany, NY, to conduct this important study on the College’s behalf.  Your answers will be gathered, analyzed, and used to help us make improvements in our students’ education. 

Just click the link below to take the online survey we have developed with Fact Finders' assistance. 

Your name will not be associated in any way with your answers. All responses are strictly confidential and will be used only for the purpose of this study.  The survey should take about 15 to 20 minutes.

<font size=3><strong>http://questionpro.com/t/CRX1bZOHdDa</strong></font>

We know that your time is valuable and we appreciate your participation. 

Sincerely,
Sarah Webster Goodwin
Professor of English
Kenan Professor of Liberal Arts
Faculty Assessment Coordinator
