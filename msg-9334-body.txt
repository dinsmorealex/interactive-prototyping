$3,000.00 Per Month, Clinton Hill/Navy Yard, Brooklyn, Plenty Of Spaces A=
vailable In Beautiful Newly Renovated Bldg! Huge Range Of Sizes/Prices Av=
ailable!
Available: Feb 01, 2015

To anyone looking for a great new studio space to work in, I have been as=
ked to refer you to a new art studio project. I&#39;ve had my studio in t=
he same building for many years now, and it truly is a wonderful place to=
 work!=20

Because it&#39;s a brand new build out, there are many different spaces a=
vailable. The prices begin at $1025-$1350 for the medium-large ones. All =
have massive windows, and and are perfect size for sharing.

And then there are the truly enormous spaces with FAR more space and even=
 more windows. These range anywhere from $1400 - $4000.=20

Each space will have plenty of light and ventilation, as well as a heat a=
nd AC unit in every space. The building also provides gorgeous rooftop vi=
ews, 24 hour access and security, and an enormous loading dock and freigh=
t elevator.=20

For those not familiar with the area, it&#39;s generally thought of as a =
safe, quiet Brooklyn neighborhood. The building is just a few blocks from=
 the G train, with plenty of food options and easy street parking.

I have had my own art studio in this building for almost 4 years, and the=
 management has asked me to help get interest in the new spaces as they a=
re expanding the number of studios in the building. I will be the one sho=
wing the spaces and there are absolutely NO fees involved.

If you&#39;re interested, please text Jordan. I look forward to hearing f=
rom you. Thanks!

$550.00 Per Month, Bed Stuy, Brooklyn, 200 sq. ft., Awesome building, awe=
some walls and awesome light
Available: Mar 01, 2015 through Sept 30, 2015

This is a nice space with really great natural lighting. One side of the =
room is all wall (this studio is one of six  in a well done build-out wit=
hin a giant warehouse space - 544 Park Ave BK). The other side this parti=
cular studio is almost all windows, northwest facing. If you look closely=
 you can see despite the foggy weather the freedom tower if you&#39;re in=
to that. The view is unobstructed and up high so the light is really its =
best feature.=20

I am looking to find a studio mate who will help me figure out how to sha=
re the space so it suits both of us. Price might be negotiable, depending=
 on how much stuff you have. I work pretty much full time and am also in =
school, but I can&#39;t part with this studio just yet. If I&#39;m ever i=
n there, it&#39;d be a Monday or a Friday, and maybe some Saturdays. You&=
#39;ll have most of the space and time to yourself in there. I have a des=
k set up to do my thing, and will probably want a little wall space somew=
here but there&#39;s plenty of that. My area will be underneath the stora=
ge loft, which you are also welcome to use - there is plenty of room up t=
here. Shelving on the other side can be yours too.

If you&#39;re interested, send me a note and let me know what you&#39;ll =
be using the space for.=20

$700.00 Per Month, South Park Slope, Brooklyn, 400 sq. ft., Large, reason=
ably-priced, South Slope artist's studio sublet
Available: Mar 01, 2015 through Oct 01, 2015

I&#39;m writing a memoir and subletting my 400 sq-ft artist&#39;s studio =
in South Park Slope, beginning March 1st, for at least 7 months--until Oc=
tober, 2015, or longer--we can talk. The $700 rent includes utilities and=
 internet.

It&#39;s really nice. On the ground floor of a small artists&#39; buildin=
g, it has two windows and a door that opens out onto a back courtyard, wh=
ich creates a good deal of light and air. The studio has 12&#39; ceilings=
, a slop sink, and good fluorescent lighting, with plenty of power and ou=
tlets for incandescent lights and equipment.

The overall 800 sq-ft space is shared with a couple of visual artists wor=
king in the other half of the space, separated by partial walls and two e=
normous curtains. Because it&#39;s on the ground floor in an old, well-in=
sulated building, it doesn&#39;t get too hot in the summer, and there is =
good baseboard heating (new boiler!) the rest of the year. There is a goo=
d drafting table/desk with a chair, a futon couch, two large empty shelf =
units, and an empty filing cabinet.

The studio is on a cross-street between 4th and 5th Aves, a couple of blo=
cks from the Green Wood Cemetery, around the corner from the best pizza p=
lace in Brooklyn, Luigi&#39;s, and on the same block as the great Girasol=
 Mexican Bakery.

The landlord, an artist himself, is happy to help with any issues that co=
me up.

$900.00 Per Month, Washington Heights, New York City, 130 sq. ft., Bedroo=
m sublet in spacious, fully renovated, 2 bedroom Washington Heights apart=
ment
Available: Mar 01, 2015 through Jan 31, 2016

Hello!

I am subletting a bedroom in my newly renovated, 2 bedroom apartment in W=
ashington Heights.  The building is less than a block away from the 191st=
 Street Subway Station, where you can access the 1 train.  The 190th Stre=
et A train Subway Station is a short walk (less than 10 minutes) from the=
 apartment.  The entrance is well-lit and secure, and is approximately 50=
 feet from the street corner. =20

The apartment is on the 3rd floor, and it is a walk-up unit.  The kitchen=
 and bathroom have new appliances and fixtures, and all floors, walls, an=
d ceilings have been refinished or painted throughout the apartment. =20

The bedroom is located at the back of the apartment (good for privacy), a=
nd comes with a standard closet.  The room has two large windows, origina=
l details, and direct access to the fire escape. =20

The size of the room is approximately 10.5&#39; x 12.5&#39; - and the cei=
ling is approximately 9.5&#39; high.  There is more than enough space for=
 a queen size bed, desk, and dresser.  The room is unfurnished.  The livi=
ng areas are fully furnished, and you will only be responsible for the be=
droom space. =20

The rent of $900 per month includes internet, and the rent of the space. =
 The monthly utility bill will be divided equally, and this includes elec=
tricity &amp; gas use.  A refundable deposit of $900 will also be due upo=
n subletting the space.  The total move-in cost will be $1800.  The suble=
t is available for up to 11 months (March 1, 2015-January 31, 2016).  I w=
ill likely renew the lease next year, at which time the sublet agreement =
could be renewed or extended.  A March 1st, or March 15th move-in date ar=
e options.

If you are looking for a shorter term, please inquire - and note in your =
email the duration of time for which you would need the space. =20

About me: 31 year old male design professional / educator / occasional ar=
tist living in New York since 2009.  I keep quite busy with work and teac=
hing, but when home, I like things to be calm, and tidy.  I enjoy having =
friends over occasionally, and I cook &amp; bake when time allows.  I jus=
t moved in last month, and the neighborhood is great!  The commute to mid=
town is quick, and takes approximately 22-25 minutes.  It is near Yeshiva=
 University, the Columbia University Campus at 168th Street (2 stops), an=
d City College at 137th Street. =20

About you: Steady income, proof of employment (or funding), and a positiv=
e outlook!  Pets are not allowed in the building, and I apologize to thos=
e of you that just let out a big sigh of disappointment.  A person that l=
ikes to keep the common spaces from getting out of hand is also a plus.  =
This would be great for a working professional, post-undergraduate studen=
t, or artist (with studio space elsewhere), but I am open to other possib=
ilities!  This is an Lgbtq-friendly home, and you should be, too.

The available bedroom is empty, as shown. =20

If you have other questions, please email me!  I will be setting up appoi=
ntments to view the space this week and weekend.  Thank you!

 top floor and a bed/bath on the lower level. The lower level also has a =

I am on the quiet side, respectful, and creative, seeking a roommate who =
is similar in manner to share my great place. I live with a fabulous 16 l=
b, 4-year-old Dachshund mix named Tina (fully trained). She is lovely, ve=
ry affectionate and not aggressive. No responsibility to take care of her=
 will fall on you, unless you love little dogs and want to play ball with=
 her. I am hoping to find someone who is mature and cheerful and takes pr=
ide in their space and who they are. I love art, running, design and the =
occasional dinner party.

The Apartment: Set in a former hospital building recently turned into res=
idences, the apartment features 16-foot ceilings and big windows, plenty =
of sunlight, very spacious and clean kitchen/living area, nice wood floor=
s and some hallway storage closets. We would share use of a large third b=
edroom and its closet. The common space of the apartment is airy and comp=
letely furnished so there is not a lot room for much added furniture.

The Room: The room available is 12&#39;x12&#39; (w/ fabulous 16&#39; ceil=
ings). It is not furnished except for a very elegantly constructed white =
wooden loft bed frame, which maximizes use of the floor space beneath it.=
 There are two bathrooms (only one tub/shower), large (and efficient) twi=
n-sized elevators, bike storage, door buzzer/intercom, w/ trash shoot and=
 recycling in hallway and roof access that gives a great view of Manhatta=

$1,400.00 Per Month, Park Slope, Brooklyn, 900 sq. ft., Lovely, spacious,=
 light-filled bedroom in Park Slope brick townhouse
Available: Apr 01, 2015

I just signed a lease for a beautiful, large, sunny 2.5-bedroom apartment=
 in a lovely brick townhouse in Park Slope (12th Street between 4th and 5=
th Avenues). I&#39;m looking for an apartment mate to take one of the bed=
rooms for an April 1 move-in date.

About the place: It&#39;s a spacious floor-through apartment on the secon=
d floor with lots of light and Brooklyn charm (sliding pocket doors, crow=
n moldings, etc.). There are hardwood parquet floors throughout the apart=
ment, all in excellent condition.=20

The bedrooms are large, both about 12 x 15 each. Plenty of room for a ful=
l or queen size bed, book cases, a desk, etc. The rooms are on opposite s=
ides of the apartment, and both of them have two windows that get great l=
ight. =20

Two smaller rooms run between the bedrooms. They can be used as a living =
room, dining room, etc. (totally open to suggestions/ideas!). And there&#=
39;s an additional small room with a single window off of the street-faci=
ng bedroom that can easily be used as a guest room, office, or extra stor=
age space. The apartment has three doors that lead to the hallway and sta=
irs, offering plenty of privacy.

The kitchen and bathroom are in great condition. Both have nice black-and=
-white tile floors, the kitchen has plenty of cabinet space, and the bath=
room has a claw foot tub.=20

Rent is $1,400 a month. To move in, you would need to provide first month=
&#39;s rent plus an additional $1,400 for the security deposit (no broker=
&#39;s fee to worry about, thankfully).=20

About me: I&#39;m an easygoing, clean, non-smoking male professional (I w=
ork as an editor/journalist in midtown) in my early 30s. I have lived in =
the Park Slope/Prospect Heights area for a while (eight or nine years, I =
think), and I&#39;ve been really happy with the neighborhood. I&#39;m ver=
y respectful of other people&#39;s space, but I&#39;m always up for grabb=
ing a drink or dinner with my roommates. I tend to keep things relatively=
 quiet at home; no huge parties every weekend or anything like that, but =
perhaps a few friends over or a dinner party once in a while.=20

If you are interested, please get in touch. Tell me a little about yourse=
lf and what you are looking for in a living situation.=20

Thanks!

Key details: 5,000 square feet. 6 bedrooms. 3 bathrooms.=20

Come live with me and my super cool roommates. Our apartment is a magical=
 oasis and the perfect escape from the chaos of NYC. It&#39;s sort of res=
embles a start-up space... or an art garage depending on when you&#39;re =
there. The roommates work during the week but enjoy hanging out in the ev=
enings. The apartment is quiet when you want it to be but there is always=
 someone around to entertain you if you choose.=20

Your room is huge with a wall of windows and a custom closet. The last ro=
ommate turned the room into a mini apt with a desk, sofa, king size bed, =
and enough room to do a floor workout or roller skate, though he never di=
d. The rest of the apt is furnished.

The shared area is amazing. It&#39;s the size of our entire block, with t=
wo living rooms, a massive projector TV, and a mix of found and whimsical=
 furnishings. We have a huge kitchen with a dining room and we love to co=
ok (well, half of us love to cook, and the others mainly order seamless a=
nd we cook for them when they&#39;re good).=20

The financial district is an awesome place to live. New restaurants and b=
ars pop up everyday and we are right near the South Street Port which wil=
l be epic once they are done with the renovations. Also, we live one bloc=
k away from every major subway line making your commute anywhere very eas=
y.

The roommates:
- A tall, happy-go-lucky, tech dude who makes basketball shorts and sneak=
ers look mad cool=20
- A fun-loving ginger who recently found her calling in ad tech although =
she would probably rather be painting monkeys or hanging out in East Afri=
ca =20
- A brilliant yet super chill computer engineer who is too lazy to chew b=
ut manages to workout everyday before work
- An incredibly thoughtful artist who recently launched her own jewelry l=
abel
- A Harvard drop-out who designs clothing at a major fashion label and te=
aches squash on the weekends=20

We love meeting new people and will make you feel right at home.

Things the roommates enjoy:
- Silly music videos=20
- Wine and bourbon=20
- Dinner parties=20
- Cooking breakfast together on the weekends=20
- bi-annual parties at the loft=20
- Arts and crafts=20
- Video games and geeky tech stuff=20
- Entreprenuership


Looking forward to meeting you!

4 with vaulted ceilings and windows looking out onto our semi-private roo=
f deck. The room includes an armoire, book shelf, and (if you want it) a =

The apartment is a third-floor walk-up duplex, meaning we&#39;ve got more=
 space than we know what to do with sometimes. The first floor has the co=
mmon areas and three of the four bedrooms, including kitchen, living room=
, and bathroom. We have a balcony off the front of the apartment overlook=
ing the street. The second floor is the fourth bedroom (the room availabl=
e) and what we&#39;d call a pretty spectacular roof deck. You can see the=
 empire state building! We have (dead) plants! And plenty of space for de=
ck furniture! Come be a lizard and sun yourself. Although maybe not right=
 now since it&#39;s kind of cold. But come summer, sure, go sun yourself.=
 Or sun yourself now. We don&#39;t judge.

.

dent at the New School, part-time funny man, and has lived here since Aug=
ust. Barrett works for an education company and moved into his room with =
the help of the Listings Project!

We&#39;re pretty chill all around, but like to put an emphasis on keeping=
 public spaces clean, since there are four of us and messes can pile up q=
uickly. No piling up dirty dishes, clean your hair out of the drains, hel=
p with the sweeping/scrubbing when necessary. Pretty basic stuff.

$908.00 Per Month, Bushwick, Brooklyn, 120 sq. ft., 1 Bedroom in a 2 BR A=
pt., 3 Blocks from Jefferson L in Bushwick!
Available: Mar 01, 2015


Hi my name is Tom. I am a 32 year-old artist, poet, and full-time booksto=
re employee. I&#39;m passionate about the written word (poetry, fiction, =
philosophy, everything) and edit a literary journal with some friends.=20=


I&#39;m looking for a roommate to fill an open, unfurnished bedroom in my=
 2 BR apartment in Bushwick, Brooklyn located 3 blocks (5 min. walk) from=
 the Jefferson L Train stop.

Rent is $908 per month plus 1/2 utilities (electricity/internet/cooking g=
as). This usually totals $60-75. The bedroom is 10 x 12 ft., and can easi=
ly fit a full or queen-sized bed, desk, and dresser, with room to spare. =
 A large living room separates the bedrooms. The kitchen is its own area =
with ample cupboard space, fridge, stove, the usual. The building itself =
is gated, with a courtyard connecting 4 apartment spaces. Neighbors are a=
 mix of families who&#39;ve been living in the neighborhood their whole l=
ives and newer arrivals.  Excellent heating in the winter. I don&#39;t ev=
en turn on my radiator.

I&#39;ve lived in the building for many years and have come to deeply lov=
e the neighborhood. Bushwick is certainly all the rage these days, with m=
any new bars, restaurants, coffee shops, and art/community spaces opening=
 up constantly. In the past year, Strangeways, a coffee shop serving some=
 of the best coffee I have ever tasted opened practically next door. Othe=
r neighborhood fixtures include: Northeast Kingdom, Union Pizza, The Rook=
ery, Montana&#39;s Trail House, Cafe Ghia, The Bathaus, The Bodega, and m=
any more.

I&#39;m looking for someone who is easy-going and reliable. I&#39;m quiet=
 and spend a lot of time in my room reading and writing, but am also down=
 to hang out and socialize from time to time. I&#39;m smoker-friendly (I =
smoke). I would prefer no pets, but am open to cats. Simply, I&#39;m look=
ing for someone chill and pleasant, with a reliable job who can pay the r=
ent on time.=20

Proof of employment preferred. Total move-in cost will be first months re=
nt + one month&#39;s security totaling $1816.

I&#39;d love to have someone interested in staying long-term (a year woul=
d be great but I&#39;m open to other longish time-frames) if everything c=
licks. The apartment is rent-stabilized, so annual increases are determin=
ed by a percentage, and should keep the rent reasonable going forward.

Contact me via email with your name, phone #, a brief description of your=
self (employment, interests, etcetera) and links to any social media prof=
iles you&#39;re willing to share. Thanks.

$1,300.00 Per Month, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 1400 sq. ft., Bedroom in hug=
e open loft off Bedford L Available: March 1 through ???
Available: Mar 01, 2015

Looking for a long-term (preferably at least 6 months) roommate to live i=
n a furnished 1400 square foot, four bedroom open loft off the Bedford Av=
enue L train starting March 1st.  The room measures 16&#39; by 8&#39;6&qu=
ot; and comes furnished, including a bed, desk, dresser, and a clothing r=
ack. The loft has a big open kitchen with skylight and a large common are=
a with wall to wall windows and plenty of room for our bikes.  It&#39;s l=
ocated in the thick of Williamsburg only 4 blocks away from the L train (=
10 minutes to Union Square) and easy walking/biking distance to all the g=
reat restaurants, bars, and shops the neighborhood has to offer. Having l=
ived here for the past 9 years, I can attest to the amazing location and =
convenience of living in the neighborhood at this specific apartment.

We are hardworking, clean, friendly and motivated in our early 20s and 30=
s: a male cinematographer and camera assistant and for tv, films, and com=
mercials (http://kylerepka.com/), a female working as a Copy Writer and Y=
oga instructor, and a male working as a Digital Product Designer for a fi=
rm in Dumbo. We keep a quiet, tidy, and respectful atmosphere about the a=
partment, so if you&#39;re loud, unkempt, and a jerk, please don&#39;t re=
spond to this post! Being very busy with our work responsibilities and va=
rious activities (traveling, going to concerts, cooking, exercising, week=
end trips, etc...), it&#39;s a rarity to all be at the apartment at the s=
ame time, but if so we&#39;re happy to see each other and catch up or coo=
k dinner. We&#39;re definitely not crazy party people, but we do occasion=
ally enjoy crazy parties, just not at our place.

If you think this seems like a good fit please respond to the post as soo=
n as possible.  Ideally, you&#39;re a considerate and interesting charact=
er with full-time job/class/internship responsibilities at relatively nor=
mal hours (no stay up all night vampires please) who does not use drugs o=
r smoke inside the apartment. We discourage work-from-home hermit types, =
wayward tourists/travelers, and bar/club/late-night employees as those ro=
ommates predominantly have completely erratic lifestyles compared to our =
own.  If you&#39;ve lived in a loft before that would be a plus but not t=
otally necessary, so long as you&#39;re aware and respectful of others. I=
&#39;m allergic to cats, so no-go for felines. We love dogs, but we&#39;r=
e very hesitant to invite along a full-time 5th roommate, especially if h=
e/she drools, smells, and barks (this goes for pets and significant other=
s - sorry, no couples).  The room is for one human.=20

All utilities are included in the $1,300 per month rent (heat, water, gas=
, electric, cable, internet, everything). One month security deposit ($13=
00) is required upon move-in that could ultimately be used for your last =
month&#39;s stay.

 really good neighborhood. Would love to fill the space!

$855.00 Per Month, South Slope, Brooklyn, Sunny, Gorgeous Room in Awesome=
 Apt
Available: Mar 15, 2015

We&#39;re looking for someone to take over the third room in our wonderfu=
l apartment in South Slope; maybe it&#39;s you!

The Building: Right near the F/G and R lines, as well as several buses. W=
e&#39;re a quick 10/15 minute walk from Prospect Park, as well as the ver=
y many great bars/restaurants/markets in the area. If you have a car, the=
re&#39;s nearly always parking available right in front of the building.

The Room: Measures 10x8.5 and has a nice-size multi-level closet. There&#=
39;s currently a queen-size bed, a desk, and a dresser in there (none of =
which is staying), so your furniture will likely fit. You are welcome to =
have the room wired for cable. There&#39;s a security deposit involved (e=
qual to a month&#39;s rent), so please keep that in mind.

The Apartment: Recently renovated and very nice with high ceilings, wood =
floors, and more storage than you can imagine (a very large kitchen pantr=
y and two hall closets). One bathroom, but that&#39;s worked perfectly fi=
ne so far. We have cable so that we can watch good stuff (Game of Thrones=
) and silly stuff (network TV). We have a Roku set up, with Netflix for a=
mazing tv-marathoning as well. Sadly, there is no laundry in the building=
, but there are a bunch of laundromats nearby. The kitchen is full of coo=
king/baking toys as we both really enjoy cooking and the appliances are f=
airly new. The bathroom has a tub/shower and additional shelving/storage.=
 The living room is extremely cozy (with a brand new couch), which is gre=
at since we spend a lot of time in it. Utilities aren&#39;t included in t=
he price and run about $80-$90 per person (includes cable/internet/ConEd/=
Nat&#39;l grid).=20

Us: Two girls, 32 and 28. We work full-time, watch a lot of TV, go out wi=
th friends, and travel less than we&#39;d like to. We&#39;ve been in this=
 apartment for 3 years and a year and half, respectively, and love both t=
he apartment and our neighborhood.

You: Work, are in your mid-late 20s (no recent college grads) or 30s. Ple=
ase do not smoke or have pets (sorry). You are kind and easy to live with=
, as well as being responsible (paying rent and bills on time, doing your=
 share of housework, ie cleaning). If you like to hang out and drink wine=
, that&#39;s definitely a plus.

*No pets allowed, no kids... and no live-in significant others.*

If this sounds like somewhere you think you&#39;d like to live, then emai=
l us and we&#39;ll let you know when/where to meet us.

Move in: March 15th or April 1st.
Note: This is a mid-lease move-in. We would much prefer someone who will =
stay on with us after we renew the lease at the end of July.

torage spaces. The room is available March 1st or sooner if needed.=20

friendly Irish male in his 30&#39;s who works in music festival productio=
n. I am a visual artist and Dj. I do this work in my studio. I have sleep=
ing quarters in my studio, so I can be very flexible around your schedule=
. I am basically looking for this type of share so I can afford to keep b=
oth my art studio and a time share my room. You, myself and my current ro=
ommate will share the common spaces. In the past, I have found that we al=
l had different schedules and were each able to have the apt to ourselves=
 alot. My art studio is 1 block from my apartment so I am mostly there.=20=

ht window facing the back of the building so is very quiet. There is a bu=
ilt-in closet with drawers in the bottom that fits a lot of clothes.

We are looking for someone who is:
-Respectful, considerate, responsible for themselves, and clean
-Doesn&#39;t bring the party home, though hosting an occasional dinner pa=
rty is not a problem
-Is busy and engaged with their own life outside the apartment
-Has a stable income
-Doesn&#39;t smoke in the apartment and doesn&#39;t do drugs

About the 2 remaining roommates:
-We are both male and gay
-One is in his later 20s and the other in his later 30s
-One works a corporate job in HR and the other is a visual artist
-The artist occasionally works from home, especially if hes not in studio=
 on a project and has an unpredictable schedule. The HR guy works a stand=
ard 10-6 M-F job and isnt home much.

To move in you&#39;d need to pay first and security ($2,300 total) and pr=
ovide income documentation, and a copy of photo ID (drivers license or pa=
ssport). Pets are not allowed as per the lease (neither dogs nor cats). T=
here isn&#39;t a TV in the apartment but there is a movie projector. All =
utilities (internet, gas, and electric) and other shared expenses (paper =
towels, dish soap etc) are about $50/month.

If this sounds like a good fit for you, please tell us something about yo=

$800.00 Per Month, BedStuy, Brooklyn, Room in a community-minded apartmen=
t in a beautiful brownstone
Available: Mar 01, 2015

We have a room open in our community-oriented home in BedStuy, in an amaz=
ing top-floor 5-bedroom apartment, 3 blocks from the Nostrand A/C. We hav=
e a community built around cooking and laughing together, freely communic=
ating, supporting each other, and having fun. We are queer and queer-frie=
ndly, and we&#39;re looking for someone who brings energy and creativity =
to their living environment.

The room is open March 1, but move-in date can be flexible. We are hoping=
 you plan to stick around for a year. The rent is $800 plus utilities, wh=
ich usually run in the $50-60 range per person.

About the room and the apartment
The smallest and sunniest room (10&#39; x 7&#39;) in the apartment is ava=
ilable. Its south-facing window gives tons of light, and it opens onto a =
fire escape for quick access to roof sitting in the summer. The main comm=
on space has an open layout, and there are two full bathrooms. There is a=
lso a small guest room with a skylight that has a futon couch--great for =
friends to stay in when they are passing through town!

(If the small room is too small for you, but you like what we have going =
on, we can shuffle who lives in which rooms to open up a bigger room for =
you that&#39;s a little more expensive.)

About us
There are four roommates in the apartment, including a couple, all of who=
m are dedicated to shaping our ideal living environment--this means low d=
rama and shared commitment to making a home. Three of us cut our teeth in=
 the DC communal group house scene, creating a hub there for neighborhood=
 potlucks, gardening, music and poetry shares, and other good stuff.

M is 34 and works for a non-profit that supports social entrepreneurs. In=
 her daydreams (and sometimes in real life), she is a vigilante making th=
e streets safe for biking and for being a woman. She&#39;s at her best wh=
en feeling grateful and adventurous, which happens most when traveling th=
e world (Bangladesh, Burma, Central African Republic, Burning Man, etc.),=
 spending hours cooking with friends and talking about how to live a life=
 that matters, and exploring religion and spirituality.=20

C is a 30-year-old grad student studying philosophy and women&#39;s/gende=
r studies. He spends a lot of time reading and thinking about crazy quest=
ions about life and nature, but he counterbalances that with quality time=
 with friends, homebuilding, and exploring the city. He likes interacting=
 with people and builds his relationships around listening, laughing, and=
 playing games. He grew up in a small rural town outside of Northampton, =
MA (behind the tofu curtain, as they say), which is reflected in a love o=
f cooking with soy sauce and cider vinegar.

M, also 30, is a musician who loves technology and creating positive soci=
al impact in the world. At home, he likes to cook, pick up the mandolin, =
and laugh really hard. He&#39;s currently working freelance, but he&#39;s=
 looking to go to grad school.

About you
Tell us who you are and what you are passionate about. What is your exper=
ience with communal/cooperative living? What are you looking for in a liv=
ing situation? Also, let us know what you do for work and how else you li=
ke to spend your time. Unfortunately, if a pet is a part of your life, it=
 won&#39;t be able to come live in the apartment. :(

Please reply with enough detail to give us a good sense of yourself. We l=
ook forward to hearing from you soon!

$850.00 Per Month, south williamsburg, brooklyn, Lovely Light Filled Room=
 in Serene Loft
Available: Mar 01, 2015 through Mar 01, 2016

Hi There,

We have a room opening up in our apartment that we are hoping to fill by =
March 1st.=20

The Apartment
Our apartment is located on S4th Street on the second floor of what used =
to be an industrial building used to craft rocket and airplane engines. T=
he space is loft style: high ceilings, hardwood floors, huge windows, ope=
n common/kitchen area and built out rooms. There is laundry on each floor=
, a dry cleaning service in the building and common roof access. Internet=
, heat and electric are not included in the rent.=20

The Room: $850
The apartment started out as an open loft space and our last roommate bui=
lt out the rooms to accommodate himself plus three friends. There are two=
 adjacent rooms on the ground floor of the apartment with the remaining t=
wo rooms directly above them. It&#39;s an atypical setup but one that can=
 be really great for the right person.=20

The room available can accommodate a full sized bed, small shelf/desk and=
 a clothing rack. There is a small storage area in the room and the apart=
ment itself has a large hallway closet that you may use. This room gets a=
 lot of great light, as one side of the room is a wall of windows.=20
You can also paint the room.=20

The New Roommates
In order for us to keep our space, you must be willing to sign on to the =
lease for at least a year, providing proof of income (the required amount=
 for combined income in the apartment is $130K). In addition, you are a c=
onsiderate, clean and responsible person who has a steady full time job. =
You can pay your rent and bills on time. You like to be social with the p=
eople you live with but know the value of personal space. You clean up af=
ter yourself and though you might enjoy going out, you will never bring t=
he party home. This is not a home for an anti-social hermit, nor will it =
be right for a party all night type. You&#39;re mature enough to have fou=
nd a balance and you embrace it.=20

The Other Roommates
We are two gals, mid 20&#39;s to early 30&#39;s. One is a colour stylist =
at a salon in Manhattan, the other is a jewelry designer/nanny.  One of u=
s has a little hypoallergenic dog, but he pretty much keeps to himself. W=
e are friends and both enjoy keeping our home peaceful, fun and clean. Ou=
r new roommate is a really chill mid 20&#39;s dude who is new to Williams=
burg.=20

If you think you might be a good fit, email us! Tell us a little about yo=
urself, link us to your FB, IG, website, etc. No couples or pets.=20

$800.00 Per Month, Bed-Stuy - Gates and Tompkins, Brooklyn, Sunny room in=
 beautiful three bedroom apt
Available: Mar 15, 2015 through Dec 31, 2015

$800 rent / $800 deposit
Utilities not included (internet, gas, electric)

Hi everyone,

We&#39;re two women living in a beautiful three bedroom apartment in bed-=
stuy, close to the G and C trains, and the B43 and B52 buses. There are a=
 few coffee shops and restaurants on our street, and a few blocks away on=
 Bedford there are plenty of other offerings.=20

We&#39;re studious, vibrant, considerate, kind, tidy, and friendly, and a=
re searching for someone to join our family style home. We have a welcomi=
ng and open shared common area, a full kitchen and one and a half bathroo=
ms. We&#39;re looking for someone who can commit to the entirety of the r=
ental period, (10 months) but can consider 6 months if necessary.=20

We&#39;re renting the third bedroom, located in the front of the apartmen=
t, which has warm southern exposure and extra privacy. The room is on the=
 smaller side and doesn&#39;t have a closet, but there is a clothing rack=
, and you&#39;re welcome to add shelves or a wall unit. The room is 12&#3=
9; long and 6&#39; wide. It is a bit narrow, but quite spacious if you do=
n&#39;t have a lot of furniture.=20

Currently, the room fits a full-sized bed, dresser, night table, and clot=
hing rack, but also has space for a small desk. There is extra storage in=
 the basement for any miscellaneous items or boxes that you&#39;d like to=
 store outside the room. (Good for books, suitcases, etc. Furniture is no=
t storable there because of mold). Also, there is free use of the washer =
and dryer unit in the basement.

The apartment is fully furnished, but the room is bare, so it is ideal fo=
r someone who has little to move. (We could however use some art for the =
living / dining area. Our current roommate is taking his with him.) Also,=
 we&#39;d like to replace the rug and paint the walls, so if you&#39;re u=
p for any of that, your input would be welcome.=20

This apartment is great for someone who enjoys roommate camaraderie; shar=
ing household responsibilities; is considerate of other people&#39;s time=
 and space; and is generally happy and easy to get along with.=20

Please email me (Joanna) with a little about yourself: job, schedule, and=
 if you feel up to it, hobbies and interests.=20

No pets, no couples.=20
Sorry :-(

(There is cat litter in the bathroom picture, but the roommate leaving is=
 taking his cat with him, so the apt. will be pet free.)

$1,275.00 Per Month, Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, Big, sun drenched, quiet bedroom=
 available in 3bdrm bed-stuy brownstone
Available: Mar 15, 2015 through May 31, 2015

Hi!! I am venturing abroad for a few months and will be subletting my roo=
m from March 15-May 31st.=20

About the place:
This room is so peaceful and serene! It faces the back of the road so it =
is really quiet, sunlight fills the room most of the day and there is a b=
ig tree just outside the window (to bring in a little nature to our urban=
 lives). It is spacious and has a large closet. There are 4 of us who hav=
e the top 2 floors of a brownstone, so needless to say it is big!!=20
There are 2 male film makers and 1 female musician who you will be sharin=
g a space with (in their late 20&#39;s). All of them are super sweet and =
welcoming. Everyone is pretty busy and sometimes the places seems like it=
 is all your own!!

Neighborhood:
I could not be happier with the location!! The street is lined with brown=
stones and feels very neighborhoody. Some of the best bars and restaurant=
s Bed-Stuy has to offer are steps away. The neighborhood has a great and =
fun vibe to it!! Not only is the neighborhood great but it is also a 15 m=
inute walk to Fort Greene which is also another fun neighborhood.

I am around the block for the G Bedford/Nostrand stop and very close to t=
he A/C Nostrand. There is also the B44 and B52 buses around the block. Ge=
tting to the city is quick and easy.

About you:
You should be reliable, tidy and able to pay rent on time. Looking forwar=
d to hearing from you!!

$1,150.00 Per Month, Bushwick/Ridgewood, Brooklyn, Sunny room plus studio=
 workspace plus private garden!
Available: Feb 24, 2015


Sunny room and studio/workspace in Bushwick/Ridgewood, $1150, heat includ=
ed.

Two private adjoining sunny rooms that open onto a private garden availab=
le. One room is a bedroom and the other a studio/workspace. The bedroom i=
s furnished with a wardrobe and clothes rack. The rooms are both quiet an=
d private, and have exclusive access to the private yard. The yard is so =
great and relaxing, there is a grapevine trellis that provides natural sh=
ade all summer, an herb garden that is bursting with mint, rosemary and b=
asil, and a yard of violets with a lilac tree in the middle. It&#39;s lik=
e a second living room in summer, whether it&#39;s for coffee on a sunday=
 morning, a glass of wine in the evening with a friend, or a think-break =
if you are working in the studio.

The apartment is a classic large pre-war boxed garden apt with living spa=
ces on opposite ends, with original detailing, high ceilings and hardwood=
 floors. It&#39;s been renovated with refinished floors and new tile, but=
 the landlord kept the original character of the building. It&#39;s rathe=
r large and the layout is such that you can rarely see your one roommate =
(me).  This is also a great situation if you need studio space, the secon=
d room has wall space, natural light, ventilation in summer, and is separ=
ated from the living space by a door and so could be used by a painter.
I have the opposite end of the apt and use it as a live/work studio, I&#3=
9;m an artist and have been active in Bushwick for about 10 yrs. I am oft=
en not there and don&#39;t use the kitchen much, so you would frequently =
have the place to yourself. I work in drawing, collage and photography.

The apt is located in an ideal area on the Bushwick/Ridgewood border, on =
a tree lined street off pretty St. Nicholas Ave. It&#39;s a short 3 block=
 walk to the L at DeKalb, as there is an L entrance and platform at Stanh=
ope and so you don&#39;t have to walk to DeKalb. It&#39;s a safe walk day=
 or night. An added bonus is that it&#39;s also 3 blocks to the M train, =
for those all too frequent L train closures.
It&#39;s close to galleries, restaurants, cafes and local bars, with laun=
dry across the street and a great local bakery.  One person please, no co=
uples, and sorry no dogs.

ght in the middle of a great street and neighborhood,  a perfect place to=
 relax after your New York adventures, and you have the whole place to yo=
urself. Check out the &#39;street view&#39; to see the sculpture garden j=
ust across the street.

I am a New York glass artist and teacher, I have a couple of pieces of ar=
t in the apartment. Your booking this apartment directly supports the art=
s. I live close by in the East Village, and would welcome any studio visi=
ts.

lenty of unique shopping, restaurants nice bars. My favorite restaurants =
include Cafe Gitane (hangout for models, artists, and great food and exce=
llent coffee), and Cafe Habana feet away from our front door.=20

The original St. Patricks Church is right across from Cafe Gitane. (Featu=
red in the film Gangs of New York by Martin Scorsese). Try to see this fi=
lm before arriving - you will recognize some of the buildings! There is a=
lso the Tenement Museum close by. It focuses on America&#39;s urban immig=
rant history, and is a wild look into how people lived and worked in New =
York in the turn of the century.

llage, SoHo, Chinatown, and has many subways in a few blocks including th=
e B,D,F,V to Broadway-Lafayette | 6 to Spring St. | J,M to Bowery. It is =
very easy to get uptown and to Brooklyn. You can walk over the Manhattan =

Close to the Broadway/Lafayette subway station and Spring Street no. 6 tr=
ain in Manhattan. Plenty of shopping and restaurants, a 5 minute walk to =
Chinatown, SoHo, Lower East Side.=20

$2,050.00 Per Month, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, ~1000 sq. ft., Freshly-painte=
d, affordable 2-bed in Fort Greene! Available early March!
Available: Mar 02, 2015 through Sept 01, 2015

We are subletting our apartment for 6 months, with the option to extend i=
f it all works out. This is the ideal place for a couple, with the opport=
unity to have a place for friends to stay, AirBnB or have a home office (=
or ball pit, if that&#39;s your thing).

The Apartment:
The apartment is a ground-floor (a few stairs to the building door), true=
 two bedroom with one full bathroom. There is plenty of storage space as =
well, with each room having a closet, along with two large hallway closet=
s (we currently use one for coats with storage above and the second for s=
torage). There is a full, separated kitchen with plenty of cabinets. The =
living room is decently-sized as well...we currently have a full bookshel=
f, couch, two arm chairs, a dresser and kitchen table in it (and we still=
 had room for a Christmas tree!). And we just painted the bedrooms a love=
ly sage-green color and the rest of the apartment a light grey.

The Building:
The building is a large brick building that used to house Navy Yard emplo=
yees and sailors. The building spans the full block between Adelphi and C=
arlton and has a large, lovely courtyard in the middle. This is a great p=
lace to lock up your everyday bike, as many of us do. We also love the bi=
g old birch tree in the middle! You guys, there is laundry right across t=
he courtyard! The laundry room has 3 washers and 3 dryers, it is coin-ope=
rated, but it&#39;s right there!

The &#39;Hood:
The neighborhood is great. Tucked between Myrtle and Park, you get the qu=
iet of Fort Greene with great access to plenty of amenities. While Lafaye=
tte and DeKalb are great, it&#39;s nice to be a bit further from the craz=
iness of the southern half of the neighborhood. There is a green grocer (=
Greeneville) about a half a block from the apartment on Myrtle. There is =
also great Thai, Indian and BBQ within a block, and our favorite for tapa=
s, Lulu and Po. Gnarly Vines (a great wine and liquor store) is just a bl=
ock away too. And Farmer in the Deli makes great greasy egg sandwiches fo=
r those hungover, lazy weekends. And Red Lantern is lovely coffee shop/ch=
eap beer bar/bike shop, also on the block (though for repairs, I will put=
 a plug in for Bicycle Station up on Park Ave). Walgreens is right nearby=
 too. There&#39;s a Bergen Bagels, plenty of bars, pubs and restaurants f=
urther east on Myrtle as well. Park Ave has a larger green grocery a few =
blocks away too. CitiBike is conveniently located at Myrtle and Adelphi a=
nd both Carlton and Clermont (the adjacent blocks) and Park. AND, you&#39=
;re only two blocks from Fort Greene Park. If you&#39;re into the whole c=
omposting thing like us, you&#39;re about an 8-minute walk from the Fort =
Greene Farmers Market which takes compost on Saturdays. Then there&#39;s =
all of the greatness of DeKalb (more coffee, brunch and dinner places tha=
n you could imagine), and the Navy Yard, both in walking distance. Seriou=
sly, there are too many neighborhood amenities to list.

The Transport:
Perhaps the one struggle, is the distance to the train. But hey, you&#39;=
ll need to walk/bike off all of those calories anyway so stop complaining=
! The closest subway (DeKalb Ave B,Q,R) is about a 12 minute walk. Once y=
ou&#39;re there, you&#39;re 2 stops to Union Square and 3 to Downtown and=
 Midtown! And nearly every train that goes into Brooklyn is within a 15 m=
inute walk (and like 5-8 mins on bike or CitiBike). And the buses along M=
yrtle, Park and Vanderbilt can get you to your friends all over Brooklyn =
in no time (ok, they&#39;re buses, give them a break...).

The $$$:
The details...rent is $2,050/month paid to us on the first of every month=
...including utilities! A steal for this area, believe us! We&#39;ll ask =
for a $2,000 security deposit as well (sorry, a smile and a handshake doe=
sn&#39;t pay the bills in this town...). If you&#39;re interested, we can=
 discuss leaving a bed/mattress in the smaller bedroom and potentially so=
me other furniture (to be discussed).

We rent the apartment and will be subletting it. We will be nearby and re=
adily available if there are any problems with the apartment. We will sho=
w the space. We will need proof of income (pay stub, tax return or letter=
 of employment).

That&#39;s all for now, reach out to us if you have any questions, as I&#=
39;m sure I missed something. Couples preferred!

$2,300.00 Per Month, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 1000 sq. ft., Best Roommate =
Ever in Beautiful Williamsburg Apt.
Available: Mar 01, 2015 through Mar 31, 2015

I have an unusual opportunity for the right person.

Right after renovating my 2 bedroom, pre-war apartment in the heart of Wi=
lliamsburg, my partner gave birth to our first child. We decided to live =
primarily in her Manhattan apartment with the little guy which means I on=
ly use my place as a home office on weekdays when Im not traveling for wo=
rk.

Im looking for a roommate who will, for all intents and purposes, have th=
e entire place to themselves 90% of the time. Put another way, Im the dre=
am roommate youre looking for never home except when youre at work.

A few details about the place:

The Good:

Its about 1000 sq feet with an open living room/kitchen and two bedrooms =
(one I use as my office). I took my time renovating it with custom-built =
bookshelves, sink cabinets, and vintage furniture. Its very comfortable, =
cozy and aesthetically pleasing (to my eye). 5 minute walk from the Bedfo=
rd and Lorimer L train and the Marcy JMZ in the heart of Williamsburg on =
a tree-lined block surrounded by restaurants, bars, shops and venues.  Th=
e apartment is fully furnished, including a queen sized bed, dresser, nig=
htstand and closet space in your bedroom.

The Bad:

Its a 6 floor walk-up which means the view is great and youll have buns o=
f steel but if stairs scare you, please keep looking as this isnt the pla=
ce for you. The building is steam-heated so being at the top means it can=
 take an hour or so to warm up on chilly days.

You are clean, absolutely non-smoking, without pets and respectful of oth=
er peoples space. I have a cleaning lady who can come as often as wed lik=
e but you are ideally someone who does a good job of cleaning up after th=
emselves already. You are also easy-going but not a push-over. If you res=
pect my space and time, I will respect yours. And you are someone who wor=
ks outside the home on weekdays (when I may be in the home office).

$2300 includes rent and utilities.

Thank you!
