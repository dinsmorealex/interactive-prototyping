$450.00 Per Month, East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 2500 sq. ft., Shared Desi=
gn/Build - Machine Shop/Welding/Fabrication
Available: Sept 16, 2014

Multiple spaces are open at Kingsland Design &amp; Engineering Lab.=20

Kingsland D&amp;E is a shared design/build space catering to artist, desi=
gners and fabricators that need a space to develop and prototype their pr=
oducts. Our shop is split into a shared Design area and a Fabrication are=
a.=20

The Design area offers your own built-in desk, WiFi, access to office and=
 large format printers, Dimension 1200sst FDM 3D printer and electronics =
equipment.=20

The Fabrication section offers access to table saws, chop/pull saws, sand=
 blasting, MIG/TIG/Oxy welding and welding tables, laser engraver/cutter =
(acrylics), 3 Vertical Milling Centers (Johnford 500VMC, Milltronics, and=
 RoboDrill), Manual/CNC Bridgeport Hybrid and Manual Lathe.=20

Holy Shit, right? Build whatever the hell you want, but we're mostly tail=
ored towards metals and plastics rather than wood to keep dust down. Also=
, we stress &quot;prototyping&quot;. We have not the room for production-=
level fabrication of large items. But, you can sure get to that point her=
e. This is a great spot for those that divide time between computer-based=
 design and physical prototyping or want to get into computer-aided manuf=
acturing. Kinetic Sculpture, Robotics, Bicycle Frames, Product Design all=
 seem to work well in this environment.

Renters get a spot in the built-in desk area in our shared office space t=
hat includes a storage shelf and room on our material racks. Build it out=
 to suit your needs. In order to keep things affordable we are now allowi=
ng two-people per desk area. If you find you need an entire area to yours=
elf, we can give you an entire space at a discount. Of course, renting a =
space gives you access to the entire shop and equipment. Month-Month leas=
e. If it doesn't work out, no problem.

vailable In Beautiful Newly Renovated Bldg! Huge Range Of Sizes/Prices Av=
ailable!
Available: Aug 01, 2014

To anyone looking for a great new studio space to work in, I have been as=
ked to refer you to a new art studio project. I've had my studio in the s=
ame building for many years now, and it truly is a wonderful place to wor=
k!=20

Because it's a brand new build out, there are many different spaces avail=
able. The prices begin at $1025-$1275 for the medium-large ones. All have=
 massive windows, and and are perfect size for sharing.

And then there are the truly enormous spaces with FAR more space and even=
 more windows. These range anywhere from $1400 - $4000.=20

Each space will have plenty of light and ventilation, as well as a heat a=
nd AC unit in every space. The building also provides gorgeous rooftop vi=
ews, 24 hour access and security, and an enormous loading dock and freigh=
t elevator.=20

For those not familiar with the area, it's generally thought of as a safe=
, quiet Brooklyn neighborhood. The building is just a few blocks from the=
 G train, with plenty of food options and easy street parking.
If you're interested, please text Jordan at 917-754-5603. I look forward =
to hearing from you. Thanks!

f (500 sq. ft.), so you would have your own 500 sq.ft. to use as you like=
. Or, if you're a photographer, we can turn the entire space into a photo=
 studio. There isn't a huge flood of natural light coming in, but an enti=
re wall of windows does light the space nicely during the day.

This is ideal if you have a small business or are an artist (or more than=
 one) looking for a great amount of space to work in. I am usually only t=
here on weekends and some evenings, so if you are looking for a space to =
use 9-5, this would be perfect for you.

I am asking $900 plus utilities (this doesn't usually exceed $30/month), =
and would prefer someone who is looking for something long term starting =
on or before October 1st. And if you can bring other people in to share, =
the rent goes down for all of us.=20

As an added bonus, there is cheap access to a large format printer in cas=
e you need to make prints and don't want to pay commercial prices.

$300.00 Per Month, Williamsburg/Bushwick, Brooklyn, 610 sq. ft., Studio S=
hare, Woodshop and Tool share for Fabricators and Makers
Available: Oct 01, 2014

Hi!
I'm looking for one more studio-mate to share a 610sq ft studio with me (=
a puppet maker), and 2 other puppet makers/set builders.=20
The studio is 4 blocks from the Grand L stop, about 6 blocks from the Gra=
ham L stop. The building has a freight elevator, loading dock, 24 hr acce=
ss, free wireless internet. My studio is on the ground floor. It has 2 wi=
ndows, lots of electrical outlets, good natural light and ventilation, an=
d there is a shared bathroom and slop sink on our floor.=20
My studio-mates and I share a power tool table with a bandsaw, belt sande=
r, dremel, drill press, table saw, welder, sewing machines, serger, etc. =
You are welcome to use these and store your own power tools here as long =
as you know how to properly use these kinds of tools safely. We also use =
spray paints, adhesives and do some casting and molding, so this studio i=
s not ideal for someone with a lot of chemical sensitivity, even though w=
e ventilate properly while using chemicals.=20

We are all pretty laid back, and very clean unless in the death-throes of=
 deadlines, and very respectful of eachother's tools. Ceilings are about =
12ft high (lower where the big pipes run). We each have our own work tabl=
es and storage area since the space allows for about 150sq feet for each =
of us, but we're really not that uptight about it if there are occasional=
ly larger projects as long as planned for. We have worked collaboratively=
 on larger projects together and are looking for a responsible, clean 4th=
 person who might be able to contribute complementary skills. Ideally, th=
is would be a long-term studio share for the right person, with one month=
s notice if you choose to leave.=20
The rent is $300/month plus we split the utility bills 4 ways (about $25/=
mo), plus 2 months security deposit to move in.=20
Thanks!
Jessica

$500.00 Per Month, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, NY, 200 sq. ft., Great Sublet &a=
mp; Terrific Location
Available: Oct 06, 2014 through Jul 06, 2015

Great artist studio available for sublet for 9 months on Greenpoint Ave. =
 This can turn into a long term share situation.  You will have the space=
 to yourself for the 9 months.

The building is a separate two story building connected to a long establi=
shed artist building with a gallery.  My studio is on the bottom floor wi=
th 7 other artists.  It is secure with a garage door so you can move thin=
gs in and out easily.  I've rented this space to a photographer and a pai=
nter in the past.  The painter signed a lease for a studio across the str=
eet once the sublet was up.  The photographer loved the space, but moved =
from the area. =20

I will have some paintings and materials there, but very organized.  You =
will still have 2 large walls to work on and another wall.  There are 2 f=
olding tables, a fridge, shelves, &amp;amp; free wi-fi &amp;amp; utilitie=
s included. UPS knows the building, I've shipped and received shipments.=20=


I need a dependable, mature individual that can commit to the duration of=
 our agreement.  I can be somewhat flexible on rent and time period, but =
once you commit you really need to stick with it.  I will ask for $500 se=
curity deposit s well.   I will introduce you to management once we come =
to an agreement.  It's a great place to concentrate.  There are a lot of =
good restaurants and grocery stores in the neighborhood as well. =20

Available: Jan 01, 2015 through Aug 01, 2016

What is a VisionHub?

A Visionhub is a small group of independent creatives formed to clarify a=
nd enhance a common core vision. This unifying thread strengthens individ=
ual projects and accelerates the manifestation of a greater communal visi=
on, transcending cultural boundaries, disciplines, and beliefs in order t=
o contribute to a healthier and more enlightened world.

Our mission is to cultivate the growth and crosspollination of other Visi=
onhub groups, working with an open source model that strengthens physical=
 and virtual groups formed around the world. Visionhubs will be linked, y=
et each as truly unique as the creatives who form them.=20

What We Offer:
Starting January 2015, PointB will transition from a live-work model to a=
 vision-work model.

Currently, we are calling for interviews with creatives who want to contr=
ibute  =20
to the prototyping of this Visionhub by joining an in-house group of like=
-minded individuals and an international network of 1000+ creative profes=
sionals established over 18 years.

We are offering individuals or collectives 6 spacious private studios/wor=
kspaces, available at 1 month, 6 month, and 1 year sublets.

The core of PointB VisionHub will be 'The Hub'  a physical 3-level space =
for talks, events, and workshops, and the location of the reference libra=
ry.

In-house members will have the opportunity to organize, curate, and parti=
cipate in all monthly programming.=20

Who we would like to see in-house:=20

Our colleagues will be global, creative professionals and innovators whos=
e work strengthens the crossovers between art, science, and spirituality.=
 They are ready to manifest and share a core vision with a reach beyond t=
hemselves. They are building the future now.

$395.00 Per Month, Little Italy, Manhattan, 160 sq. ft., Body work- Massa=
ge studio/office avilable for share, really cool!
Available: Sept 22, 2014

I have a beautiful new studio/office I use for Zero Balancing (osteopathi=
c bodywork) that I would like to offer to another healing practitioner.
It's on Broome just below Bowery so it's convenient to the JM/ NRQ/ BD/ a=
nd 6 trains.
My space is up a flight of easy, wide stairs on a floor with 4 other arti=
sts.
The space has new walls, a new wood floor, a silver-leaf door, and a beau=
tiful skylight! It's serene.
The room is about 160sq. ft. so there's ample room for a small group (2-4=
), like for Pilates or Yoga.
I have a small seating area, yoga mats, a desk, file cabinet, an Ikea cre=
denza for sheets, and my bodywork table.
Otherwise, it has a bohemian atmosphere very different than a healing cen=
ter/office type one. It's so refreshing having a whole studio to yourself=
 for this kind of work. Outside my space it's not pristine, like I say, i=
t is an artists building, but it's cool. The bathroom isn't super fancy e=
ither, but it's quite new and very clean. My clients love the space and f=
ind it a comfortable setting for receiving bodywork. I don't play music, =
but you could if you want.
The neighborhood is hip and lively and there are a variety of cafes and e=
ateries close by.
The space would be ideal for Feldenkrais, Rolfing, Alexander technique, M=
assage, private yoga, Reflexology, etc.

$1,040.00 Per Month, Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, Room for Rent in Great Pr=
e-War Apartment Seconds from Prospect Park
Available: Oct 01, 2014 through Aug 31, 2015

I am looking for a friendly, responsible, and cleanly flatmate to rent a =
lovely room in my spacious 2-bedroom apartment in Windsor Terrace, Brookl=
yn. The apartment is in a very well maintained pre-war building just a fe=
w steps from Prospect Park. Easy and safe subway and bus connections (1 b=
lock to F and G trains at Ft. Hamilton Parkway, 12 minute walk to Q train=
).=20

The Room: The room is 11' x 10' and has a small closet with two shelves a=
nd hanging space. The room has two bright windows with wood venetian blin=
ds and hardwood floors. The available bedroom will be unfurnished except =
for a solid wood armoire with hanging space on top and shelves on bottom =
(pic to come). In addition, there is a small linen closet with shelves in=
 the hallway which is reserved entirely for this room to supplement stora=
ge space. You are also welcome to keep coats in the front hall closet and=
 there is room to store a box and/or a suitcase as well.

The remainder of the apartment is fully furnished.=20

I'd like to find a flatmate who is thoughtful, easy-going, and a good com=
municator. You should also be steadily employed and preferably work away =
from home by and large. I have lived here for 9 years and I am pretty set=
tled in, but I'm happy to share my home. I'd like a roommate who will con=
tribute to the household by purchasing household staples together and hel=
ping with periodic cleaning of common spaces. I will ask you about your d=
ay and be happy to share a meal when our schedules coincide.=20

* Rent is $1040 month plus security deposit (1.5x monthly rent).
* Heat and hot water included.
* We would split the cost of gas/electric and Cable TV/Wi-Fi Internet equ=
ally. This runs approximately $115/each a month.

Available October 1. This rental period is until the end of Aug 2015 with=
 potential to renew.

About Me:

I'm 35 yrs old (female) and I work as Director of community organizing an=
d social justice programs for a non-profit in Manhattan. I am social and =
thoughtful. I am a bit artistic though I tend to lean towards &quot;funct=
ional&quot; art and crafts, carpentry, etc. I like to go hiking and also =
enjoy cooking but tend to forage in the fridge when it is just me coming =
home late from work which happens often. On a typical weeknight, if I am =
getting home anytime after 8pm, I tend to crash on the couch with a good =
book or watch TV, if I haven't made plans to hang out with friends. On a =
particularly energetic day, I might wake up and go for a walk/run in the =
park before work and on others I hit the snooze on my alarm clock several=
 times before I can drag myself to a shower. Aside from an occasional bac=
k log of laundry in my own room, and once in a while a rinsed dish or two=
 in the sink, I like to keep the apartment very clean and orderly for a b=
it of calm. I expect my flatmate to contribute to maintaining this peacef=
ul and airy vibe.

My Home's Features:

Well maintained pre-war elevator apartment building with great charm. Red=
 brick building, terrazzo floors in halls and lobby.
Well equipped eat-in-kitchen, with plenty of cabinet space, though best s=
uited for a tall person, which I am not...
Large living room with ample seating and space to relax after a long day.=
=20
Original hardwood floors throughout and many windows.
Clean space and clutter free.
Pay per load washers/dryers available in basement.
Sorry, NO pets allowed.
No cigarette smokers.
Please do not email me if you are a couple seeking housing together... I =
am looking for one roommate only.

If you are interested please send me a note with information about yourse=
lf like I have included here. Please allow me a day or so to respond.=20

$1,000.00 Per Month, Flatbush/Prospect Lefferts, Brooklyn, 140 sq. ft., B=
eautiful Sun-filled corner room near the Park
Available: Oct 01, 2014 through Jun 01, 2015

Sadly I have to leave my beautiful room and awesome roomies and am lookin=
g for a good person to take my place in this great 3 Bedroom apartment ju=
st south of Prospect Park.  The apartment is stunning and clean with a la=
rge common area and  a gorgeous modern bathroom with tiled shower and kit=
chen with updated appliances.  Wood floors throughout and a beautiful fir=
e escape/small deck where we sometimes hang out with a glass of wine.  Fe=
el free to grow vegies and potted plants here.  The apartment is on the 3=
rd floor of a corner building in the beautiful south Prospect Park area o=
f Brooklyn.  There are cool markets and tons of shops and a cute little c=
offee shop just down the road.  A short walk to Cortelyou and you'll be i=
n the heart of some of the best bars in Park Slope and amazing pour over =
coffee and brunch places.  The best part is you're just steps away from P=
rospect Park.  Come enjoy it while the weather is still nice!

The room is approximately 140 square feet and would easily fit a queen si=
ze bed.  It's a corner room, so it's the best room in the apartment - you=
've got windows on all sides to let the light in on those gloomy winter d=
ays.  The room has a nice sized closet with hanging bar to store all your=
 fancy goods.=20

Other perks: Rent includes Electric, Gas and Wifi - wifi is super fast in=
 the building as well, so you never have to be interrupted whilst streami=
ng Netflix movies.

The roomies are awesome.  One is a grad student at NYU studying Councelin=
g Psych and working with the Wounded Warrior Foundation.  The second is a=
 working musician.  Both really nice, down to earth guys and they're ofte=
n out all day so sometimes it gets pretty quiet in the apartment.  Seriou=
sly, these are two of the easiest to get along with dudes I've ever lived=
 with.  They are clean and respectful and expect the same, but they can b=
oth enjoy the occasional night out after work or school and like to cook =
communal roommate dinners in the apartment from time to time.

Move-in date is October 1st.  Length of stay is flexible.  No pets or smo=
kers please.  Apartment is a short walk to the B/Q or the 2/5 trains with=
 plenty of local bus options as well.  Area is safe and buzzing with thin=
gs to do.

$1,300.00 Per Month, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 1400 sq. ft., Semi-furnished=
 bedroom in huge open loft off Bedford L Available: Oct 1 through ???
Available: Oct 01, 2014

Looking for a long-term (at least 3 month) roommate to live in a furnishe=
d 1400 square foot, four bedroom open loft off the Bedford Avenue L train=
 starting August 1st.   The bedroom is available immediately, so please c=
ontact us right away to meet us and visit the apartment.  The room has a =
full mattress and bedframe, desk with lamp, chair, open dresser with hang=
ing rack section, and shelving. The loft has a big open kitchen with skyl=
ight and a large common area with wall to wall windows and plenty of room=
 for our bikes.  It's located in the thick of Williamsburg only 4 blocks =
away from the L train (10 minutes to Union Square) and easy walking/bikin=
g distance to all the great restaurants, bars, and shops the neighborhood=
 has to offer. Having lived here for the past 9 years, I can attest to th=
e amazing location and convenience of living in the neighborhood at this =
specific apartment.

We are hardworking, clean, friendly and motivated in our early 20s and 30=
s: a male cinematographer and camera assistant and for tv, films, and com=
mercials (http://kylerepka.com/), a female working in fabric research and=
 development for Tory Burch, and a female working in corporate customer s=
ervice for MZ Wallace. We keep a quiet, tidy, and respectful atmosphere a=
bout the apartment, so if you're loud, unkempt, and a jerk, please don't =
respond to this post! Being very busy with our work responsibilities and =
various activities (going to art galleries/museums, traveling, going to c=
oncerts, cooking, exercising, etc.), it's a rarity to all be at the apart=
ment at the same time, but if so we're happy to see each other and catch =
up or cook dinner. We're definitely not crazy party people, but we do occ=
asionally enjoy crazy parties, just not at our place.

If you think this seems like a good fit please respond to the post as soo=
n as possible.  Ideally, you're a considerate and interesting character w=
ith full-time job/class/internship responsibilities at relatively normal =
hours (no stay up all night vampires please) who does not use drugs or sm=
oke inside the apartment. We discourage work-from-home hermit types, wayw=
ard tourists/travelers, and bar/club/late-night employees as those roomma=
tes predominantly have completely erratic lifestyles compared to our own.=
 If you've lived in a loft before that would be a plus but not totally ne=
cessary, so long as you're aware and respectful of others. I'm allergic t=
o cats, so no-go for felines. We love dogs, but we're very hesitant to in=
vite along a full-time 5th roommate, especially if he/she drools, smells,=
 and barks (this goes for pets and significant others - sorry, no couples=
).  The room is for one human.=20

All utilities are included in the $1,300 per month rent (heat, water, gas=
, electric, cable, internet, everything). One month security deposit ($13=
00) is required upon move-in that could ultimately be used for your last =
month's stay.

(Note: The panoramic photos of the bedroom were taken with a different be=
d in place.  The closeup photo of the bed shows the one currently in the =
room.  Of course, if you're looking for a longer term stay, as we'd prefe=
r, and have furniture of your own or would like to buy new furniture, you=
're by no means required to keep what's in the room.)

$1,050.00 Per Month, Bushwick, Brooklyn, A modest and mint-colored room i=
n an easy-going Bushwick apartment, right on Myrtle, is looking for a fri=
end. Could it be you?
Available: Oct 01, 2014 through Oct 01, 2015

Hi! I am looking for a roommate starting in october for my apartment in B=
ushwick. The rent is $1050/month including all utilities and internet. Th=
e apartment is cozy, located on Myrtle Avenue, a few steps away from the =
Central M stop, and neighboring local dives like Happy Fun Hideaway, Sile=
nt Barn, Little Skips, Norbert's, and the like. Theoretically, you could =
go to Bossa Nova every night and be directly across the street from your =
bed, if you so choose to. You are also 10 minutes away from the Myrtle/Br=
oadway JMZ and the Dekalb L. A laundromat and psychic are located on the =
first floor of our building. Your room is modest and mint-colored and you=
'll share a fully stocked and furnished kitchen and living space (minus a=
 mattress) with Stevie, my cat, and yours truly. That said, requirements =
include a strong love for cats and an easy-going demeanor. General cleanl=
iness is more than welcome, but being messy is always better than being u=
ptight. Smokers preferred. Must like books and pastel colors. Since I pla=
y loud music and your window faces the train, light sleepers might not wa=
nt to apply. No dicks, please.

More about me: I am a 23 year old woman working in publishing. I like to =
stay up late and write.=20

$1,075.00 Per Month, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 200 sq. ft., Big Room in Per=
fect, Central Location!
Available: Sept 01, 2014 through Sept 01, 2015

Hi,
I have one bedroom available in a big, (mostly) furnished, two bedroom ap=
artment that I've lived in for the past 10 months. It's a great, old scho=
ol building in East Williamsburg -- safe, clean, and comfy with some quir=
ky Brooklyn charm. My roommate is taking all her bedroom furniture, so th=
e room will be totally empty for move in! Ideally, I'm hoping to find som=
eone who is looking to stay for at least a year -- but I will consider th=
e right, short term person (singular. no couples, please!)

Full disclosure: the apartment is a railroad, but your room is the one co=
nnected to the living room/ kitchen/ bathroom, so you don't have to walk =
through my space to access anything. Plus, my room has a separate entranc=
e, so you have total privacy.

The Upsides:
-The apartment is spacious for the city. The rooms are wide and long, so =
we won't be living on top of each other. In fact, your room would be the =
bigger of the two (about 200+ sq. ft.)

- There is a community garden next door that all tenants can have key acc=
ess to, plus there is a little fire escape off the bathroom, so if you li=
ke growing things, you can (++ points if you have a green thumb, I keep k=
illing my houseplants...).

- The neighborhood is great. Lots of bars and restaurants and all those t=
hings that kids these days seem to enjoy.

- A short walk to your pick of trains (either the Montrose L, the Lorimer=
 J/M, or the Broadway G)

- Super lives in the building, and is very attentive.=20

- Heat and hot water included!

The Downsides:
- Your room does not have any windows (that's the nature of rail roads...=
), but some people (vampires? goths?) like that sort of thing. Additional=
ly, the living room to which your space is attached gets great light, and=
 there are high-powered ceiling fans throughout, so it feels air and priv=
ate

- No pets allowed (although the landlord said he'd make exceptions for a =
good-natured goldfish)

About me: I am a 28 year old, fully employed, pretty normal chick (person=
, woman, lady?...it all sounds awkward). I work in brand strategy for a d=
igital publisher, and am out of the house every day at least from 9-7. I'=
ve lived in the city for 10 years, so I've seen a lot of crappy NYC apart=
ments, and really get a warm cozy feeling about this one.

I'm looking for someone who is clean, respectful, creative and interested=
 in making a contribution to the space. It would be great if we could be =
friends, but I'm also very much into nesting when I'm home, so I like my =
personal space. It's totally cool if you want to have the occasional gues=
t over (and I certainly intend to), but I don't want a constant party. Yo=
u should be a non-smoker, but I like casual drinkers (as long as they are=
n't fall down -- after all, it's a 3rd floor walk up...).

Anyway, if the place sounds like a fit for you, please send me an email t=
elling me a bit about yourself, and I'll arrange a time to give you a tou=
r!

PS: It's 1st+Last+Security=3D $3,225 to move in! Heat and Hot water inclu=
ded, utilities generally fun about $50-75 depending on the season!

One bedroom available in beautiful 3 bedroom apartment in Park Slope!
14th St and 4th Ave. Close to F/G/R.
Move-in: October 1.
*The bedroom may be available before October 1, please let me know what y=
our needs are.*

Length of sublet: The lease on the apartment runs through August 2015. Id=
eally I'd like someone who can commit through March, and then it will wor=
k out for them to stay through August. But I am open to different time fr=
ames, with a minimum of 3 months, so please let me know what your needs a=
re.

* $950/mo covers rent AND utilities
1 month rent plus 1 month security deposit $1900 required upon move-in. T=
his is a steal for a great neighborhood and a lovely shared space!

Females only, sorry dudes! No pets, please. And sorry, no couples!=20

The room fits a full bed &amp; desk/dresser nicely, but it is on the smal=
l side. If you have a lot of stuff this is probably not the best situatio=
n for you! The room has a window and a closet.

You'll be joining two females in their early thirties who have style &amp=
; grace &amp; fun, full lives, but keep the common areas clean and neat a=
nd are very respectful of each other when we are all at home. We are both=
 vegetarian though it's not a strict policy about the apt.

The living room and kitchen are furnished. Juicer, blender, yoga mats, to=
aster, sewing machine all available for your use. The apartment has a lar=
ge central living room, a kitchen, bathroom and 3 bedrooms. All three bed=
rooms have windows and closets as well as high storage areas. The apartme=
nt has nice old wood floors and high ceilings, but the kitchen is not mod=
ernized (no dishwasher!) and the bathroom is pretty small. But other than=
 that I think it has a spacious feel and an intangible good vibe!

The closest subway is the F/G/R at 4th Ave &amp; 9st in Park Slope. It's =
a nice, safe area, 4 avenues east of beautiful Prospect Park. Both 5th Av=
e &amp; 7th Ave are filled with bars restaurants and shopping. It's also =
close to Carroll Gardens/ Smith Street in Brooklyn which is a nice shoppi=
ng/ eating area. Laundromat is across the street &amp; there are grocery =
stores, yoga, gym, great coffee-shops, and anything else you may need nea=
rby. High speed internet but no cable or tv.

When you reply, please tell me about yourself, including your current liv=
ing situation and why are you looking for a sublet, your schedule, and an=
ything else you'd like to share!

Feel free to ask questions. One thing is that we don't have good indoor b=
ike storage so unless you keep your bike in your room, it's kind of a bum=
mer.

$1,650.00 Per Month, Upper West Side, New York, 1 Bedroom In Prime UWS Tr=
ue 2-Bedroom Apt
Available: Nov 01, 2014

I am looking for someone to take over my roommate's lease starting Novemb=
er 1, 2014, going until either June 1, 2015 or November 1, 2015. Rent is =
$1,650 per month, and includes gas, heat, and water.

The room:
This airy, light-filled bedroom is part of a true 2-bedroom/1 bath locate=
d in prime upper west side.

Your room has a large window with southern exposure, french doors, a buil=
t-in full-size closet, and the advantage of more privacy compared to my s=
maller, kitchen-facing bedroom.=20

The apartment:=20
The common area is furnished with a couch and dining table, and is great =
for hosting dinners or lounging. It fills with light during the day. The =
kitchen has considerable counter space and comes with a breakfast bar, a =
new dishwasher, and a ton of cabinet space that is still unused. Bathroom=
 with tub is spotless, with a window for aeration. You also get rooftop a=
ccess, perfect for low-key get togethers.

The building is quiet, with a lot of friendly tenants, and provides a gre=
at break from the chaos of city life. Best of all, the super and landlady=
 are responsive and helpful, and we've gotten any apt issues addressed wi=
thin 24 hours.

The area:
The apartment is located on 88th and Broadway, 2 blocks from the 86th str=
eet 1 stop, 6 blocks from the 96th street 1, 2, 3, stop, or 3 avenues fro=
m the B, C stop.

Within a five-block radius is an amazing mix of bars, restaurants, banks =
(Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo), and grocery stores including Dead =
Poet, Bodrum, Mermaid Inn, Zabars (8 blocks), Juice Generation, and Fairw=
ay. There's also a Trader Joe's 2 stops away on 72nd street, and a Whole =
Foods 1 stop away off of 96th street. Downtown, Queens, and Brooklyn are =
all 15-30 minutes away thanks to the ever reliable 1, 2, 3 train.

There are a ton of gyms nearby/within walking distance, including City Re=
c Centers, Crunch, New York Sports Club, and Equinox. You could also join=
 the jogging crowd at Riverside Park, which is 1.5 avenues away, or at Ce=
ntral Park 3 avenues away.

You:=20
You are ideally a 20-something female who is clean (you do your dishes af=
ter every meal), works a steady, full-time job, and doesnt host regular g=
uests. Don't be turned off if this isn't exactly you though - I'll consid=
er mostly anyone. I do house the occasional friend/friend visiting from o=
ut of town for the weekend, but I don't make it a habit. I have a 9-6 but=
 often work late, and am generally looking for someone who can maintain t=
he peace of the apartment. That said, I'd also love if we got along and c=
ould share a meal or drink once in a while!

You'll need to have decent credit and proof of adequate income/a guaranto=
r to get on the lease.

Misc.:
My roommate, who is moving back to the west coast, is interested in selli=
ng her all the furniture shown in the room at a very reasonable price.

The lease:
My roommate and I found the apartment through a broker one year ago follo=
wing an intense two-week search, and I'd love to hold on to it for at lea=
st another year!

You will need first and last month's rent ($1,650) to sign.

Please message me with some info about yourself/any questions you may hav=
e.

$835.00 Per Month, Greenpoint, Brooklyn NY, Sunny and fairly big room in =
duplex with garden
Available: Oct 15, 2014

Hi! There is a room opening in our beautiful, spacious, and somewhat biza=
rrely laid out two-story apartment. The room has two windows facing the g=
arden and a built-in closet, and it is big enough to fit a queen size bed=
, a desk, a couple of bookshelves, and an armchair without feeling stuffe=
d. The three rooms and the bathroom (also spacious) are on the 1st floor =
and on the ground floor there is the dinning room with the kitchen, sever=
al closets, a restroom equipped just for the most prosaic actions, and a =
big patio with a garden. The kitchen is well equipped and big, for those =
who are into cooking. =20

We are two women in our (quite) early 30s and we both work and are gradua=
te students. She is in a Masters in technology; I am a PhD student in Mus=
ic and Film. She knows better. We are active, friendly, enjoy the neighbo=
rhood and life as much as/when we can. We love cinema (Bergman, Bridget J=
ones Diary), music (Bruce Willis, Debussy, punk), art contemplation and p=
ractice (she designs and manufactures all sorts of things and makes anima=
tion, I play cello whenever I can get one), and moving (biking, insomnia)=
. We get along, hang out when its possible and we feel like it, and suppo=
rt each other while maintaining independence and respect. We clean after =
ourselves and keep the house nice while not being obsessed with it. We wo=
uld like to keep this dynamic.=20
We would like our next roommate to have a similar profile regarding gende=
r, age, and outlook of life. We welcome all sexual orientations or lack t=
hereof. =20

The basics: rent is $835, utilities $40-60, $deposit.=20

No smoking inside the house but there is the garden and the beautiful str=
eet.=20

(The photos are way worse than the apartment, it is not having a very pho=
togenic day)

We will start meeting potential roommates on September 21st.

dows in the bedroom, kitchen and bathroom.  Apartment has dishwasher and =
in suite laundry.  Bedroom has a decent sized closet and enough room for =
a double bed (you could fit a queen sized bed with room leftover but less=

 air conditioner in the bedroom, which you could use until the end of my =
lease next year.

The apartment is basically all furnished as all of the items in the apart=

$1,000.00 Per Month, Clinton Hill / Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, 1000 sq. ft., Two=
 spacious rooms for rent, high ceilings
Available: Oct 01, 2014 through Apr 01, 2015

Hello hello! My name's Johnny, I'm a documentary film editor, and I'm loo=
king to rent the master bedroom and a side bedroom in my apartment, Oct 1=
 - April 1. If you're looking for a spacious room in a chill apartment, d=
rop me a line :) We're on the third floor of a spacious old building, one=
 block away from the G-train at Classon Ave or the B38 bus to Atlantic Av=
e, and a 10-min walk from the C. It's an easy apartment to live in, I'd s=
ay. The vibe here and the building we're in is pretty low key. Here are t=
he deets on the two rooms:

Master Bedroom
-12'x16', wood floors, 13' ceilings, window over quiet back lot, AC, dres=
ser, closet
-Plenty of space for other furniture, if you like
-$1000/mo + utilities

Side Bedroom
-15'x25', wood floors, 13' ceilings, ceiling fan, air purifier -- massive=
 space (you could play basketball in here, no joke) but it doesn't have a=
n outside window, so it's prime for someone on a tighter budget :)
-$600/mo + utilities

Bathroom with bath/shower. Laundry's in the basement. Grocery store at th=
e end of the block. I'm in the smallest of the three bedrooms. We've got =
a big open common room with big windows, a dining room table, couch, and =
kitchen. The high ceilings are a big plus.

I've been in the apartment for a year now, and I'll be here through the e=
nd of the lease in April. Looking for someone to come in until the end of=
 the lease. If you're interested in taking over the lease in April, that'=
ll be an option for sure, so be sure to mention that when we talk!

So, send me an email telling me a little about yourself, which room or ro=
oms you're interested in, and we'll take it from there. Thanks!

$1,200.00 Per Month, Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, One Furnished Bedroom / =
Good Vibes
Available: Oct 01, 2014 through Dec 31, 2014

Hey,

Looking to sublet one furnished bedroom in very large two bedroom apartme=
nt for 1-3 month duration. The apartment is in a four story building on a=
 great block in Prospect Heights. There are lots of plants and great ligh=
t in most of the rooms, access to the roof as well as shared backyard wit=
h a comfy hammock and charcoal grill. Throw a stone and you'll hit a bar =
or restaurant or coffee shop. Q, B, 2, 3, 4, 5, C Trains all within a 10 =
minute walk. Prospect Park and Botanical Garden 10 minute walk too.

I'm a 32 year old professional in film/video production. I have a work st=
udio near the Navy Yard, often I'm only home in the evenings. I cook some=
times and occasionally have friends over for dinner. You're more than wel=
come to do the same.=20

I'm ok with a little mess but if you need someone to remind you to do the=
 dishes, look elsewhere. Smoking cigarettes or weed is fine as long as yo=
u're by the window. I like making conversation, probably better if you do=
 too. Sorry no cats, dogs or couples.=20

I'll be showing the place this week. Give a shout if you want to arrange =
a time to see it.

Thank you

The bedroom is very large, with high ceilings, a huge closet with ample s=
helf space, two massive windows and hard wood floors. It can easily fit a=
 queen size bed (and could also fit a king size). The bedroom is facing t=
he courtyard so it is very quiet. The bedroom is also located on the oppo=
site end of the apartment so it is quite private and does not share a wal=
l with the other bedroom.=20

The apartment is flooded with light, fully decorated, spacious, and the n=
eighborhood is absolutely amazing! It has an open kitchen with a dining a=
rea and the bathroom is quite large and was just completely re-done. The =
living room is so comfortable, very spacious, and we have a big flat scre=
en t.v.

garden!), a movie theater (Park Slope Pavilion), the Food Co-Op, and Pros=
pect Park is literally across the street. I'm pretty much obsessed with t=
he park; it's amazing - especially if you like running/biking, picnicking=
 etc..=20

F and G subway lines are located 2 blocks from the apartment (it takes me=
 about 15 minutes to get to lower Manhattan).
=20
About Me: Im a young professional, recent college graduate in my 20s and =
I share the apartment with my boyfriend. We both work from 9 - 6 in Manha=
ttan and enjoy winding down over the weekend by going to the park, hangin=
g with friends, going to music events, and generally just chilling out. W=
e love to drink wine, cook, and are 420 friendly. If you like to party, t=
hats cool, so do I. We only ask that you be respectful about bringing the=
 party home and, please, no strangers randomly staying over. Also, we hav=
e a small puppy...he is adorable.=20

$935.00 Per Month, Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, Gorgeous room in a classic, large =
Bed-Stuy apartment
Available: Oct 01, 2014 through May 01, 2015

Up for rent is one bedroom in our large 3 bedroom apartment located right=
 off the Nostrand A/C train station. The room is really big, has hard woo=
d floors, and still has the original mantel from when these homes used to=
 have fireplaces. It also has two big windows that overlook the backyard,=
 enough room for at least 2-3 dressers, a queen size bed, and with space =
to still walk around.=20

Everyone says this, but this apartment is a real gem. Our kitchen is mass=
ive and all of the appliances are no more than a year old. We even have o=
ur own washer and dryer in the apartment which is just one of the great t=
hings about this place. The living room and dining room are so big that w=
e're still trying to fill them with furniture and art (please help us!).=20=


My roommate and I are both females in our mid-20s and are looking for som=
eone in that age range (or at least under 35) and of either gender. Some =
things we enjoy: music, art, film, working out, eating, cooking, drinking=
 with friends, going out on the town, watching Game Of Thrones. We're 420=
 friendly and cool with you having an active social life - just try to no=
t bring it home all the time. The one thing we are really looking for is =
someone who is really clean and likes to keep a clean apartment - we do a=
 big clean every 2 weeks and we've never had any bugs, mice, nothing. Als=
o looking for someone who wants to hang with us and be friends - and not =
just live here as a stranger.=20

You will be taking over the lease for a current roommate who is moving ou=
t, and the start date is October 1st - but could also be started up until=
 Nov. 1 as well. The lease goes until May 1, 2015, and is pretty informal=
 - if you need to break it, you would have to find us a new roommate and =
give 2 months notice. If this sounds cool to you, send us an email and te=
ll us about yourself!=20

$1,250.00 Per Month, Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, Bedroom available early Dec t=
o early Jan in beautiful, spacious Boerum Hill two-bedroom
Available: Oct 06, 2014 through Jan 12, 2015

I'm a writer who will be out of the country for a few months this fall an=
d am looking for someone to take my lovely room in my wonderful Boerum Hi=
ll apartment while I'm gone. It's a really lovely spot and my roommate is=
 a good friend of mine, so we're looking for someone who will be a really=
 good fit for the space.

Details:

I'm leaving October 6 and will be back January 12. If you need to move ou=
t a day or two later, we have a pull-out couch, two air mattresses, and l=
ots of storage space, so we can discuss it. Rent is $1250 per month, plus=
 utilities, and my room is furnished; I will probably ask for security de=
posit, depending upon how we work things out with the landlord. I have on=
e lovely roommate, who's a very good friend of mine; she's a 30-year-old =
freelance magazine writer who's crafty and makes ice cream for fun and ha=
s literally every home gadget you could think of. We aren't OCD, but we k=
eep the apartment clean and neat, and would expect a subletter to do the =
same; also, while we have a well-stocked bar, we don't smoke or do any dr=
ugs, and would ask that you not bring the party home.

The apartment is really big  bedrooms are on opposite sides of the apartm=
ent, the kitchen and living room are separate and each quite large (I've =
never seen a bigger kitchen in a New York apartment, actually), the whole=
 place is very airy and light, and we have a roof deck. It's a five-to-se=
ven-minute walk to pretty much any subway line, so it's super easy to get=
 around (15 mins to Lower Manhattan), and the neighborhood is great.

I forgot to take pictures in time to post this, but can send if you're in=
terested; even better, you can come visit and see for yourself.

 music and DJ, but not at home...unless you request it :) Besides a very =
occasional cocktail/dinner party, this is very much a chill, quiet (and c=

Corner Apt - Prewar size with modern renovation
Available: Nov 01, 2014

The Situation:  We are (unfortunately) leaving NYC and need to break our =
lease to do so.  So, we are looking to reassign our remaining term.  As o=
f November 1st, there will be 9 months left on the current lease , unless=
 you renegotiate the lease with the management company.

The Apartment:  4 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms in a corner unit on the 3rd floor=
.  Gut renovated just over 2 years ago, the owner put in hard wood floors=
, stained wood doors, trim and window casing, stainless steel appliances =
a dishwasher and granite counter tops.  We added bamboo shades, island li=
ghting and under the counter lighting.  Those, along with the 5 window A/=
C units can stay with the apartment, if the new tenant wants them (won't =
need them where we are going).  The living room/dining/kitchen area is op=
en and spacious.  The bedrooms are all pretty big (as most prewar buildin=
gs have).  The smallest bedroom is large enough to fit a queen size bed, =
book shelf, chair and dresser, and has it's own full bathroom.=20

The building was built in 1915 and is 6 stories high.  It has an elevator=
 and ramp entrance as well as a laundry room.  There is a live in super. =
 This is a pet friendly building.  Since these apartments are larger, the=
re is a good mix of families and student shares.  We have found it to be =
a quiet building and have felt extremely safe living here these past few =
years.
=20
The Neighborhood: The building is in Washington Heights, West of Broadway=
, at the corner of 172nd and Fort Washington Ave, a few blocks north of C=
olumbia Presbyterian.  It's a fairly residential neighborhood, just south=
 of the GW bridge, with access to Fort Tryon Park, Riverside Park and our=
 local park, J Hood Wright that has fields, a playground, rec center, dog=
 run (recently renovated) and a spectacular view of the bridge.  That's j=
ust 1 block north of us and there are a few resident Hawks nesting there.=
  We are 3 blocks from the A train and 5 blocks to the C or the 1 train. =
 Since we are near the GW Port Authority Bus Terminal, there are several =
bus lines in this neighborhood (including a stop in front of our building=
).

$1,800.00 Per Month, East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 700 sq. ft., Light and =
green- nice big railroad
Available: Nov 10, 2014 through Dec 01, 2014

Looking for a subletter for most or all of November- dates are slightly n=
egotiable. I have all these lovely plants that need to be watered while I=
'm away so please be willing and able.

The apartment has four large rooms. The kitchen has all the things you ne=
ed to prepare a big meal plus a nice dining table that pulls out to seat =
6-8. The adjacent room I just use as a glorified closet but could be swit=
ched around or used differently. Then there's a bedroom with a little pal=
m tree and a couple ferns and finally the living room which has a comfy c=
ouch and relaxing chair, a desk, records and books, a desktop computer an=
d more plants.=20

There is warm heat and fast WiFi. It is about a 6 minute walk to either t=
he Graham or Grand stops off the L train. The neighborhood has everything=
 you need- friendly laundromat and bodega on the corner, and Graham Ave v=
illage for restaurants, groceries, art supplies, coffee, whatever. It's a=
 great place. The only downside is that it's on Metropolitan Avenue which=
 can be loud. It doesn't much bother me but everyone's different.=20

Monthly rent will be prorated for the dates you stay. Utilities cost extr=
a but only a modest amount. Only inquire if you are looking for a place f=
or most of November like three weeks or more.=20

Thanks!

$1,404.00 Per Month, Crown Heights, Brooklyn, 800 sq. ft., Spacious renov=
ated 1 bedroom
Available: Oct 01, 2014 through Jan 31, 2015

Hi there!

My name is Saya. I am a graphic designer who is planning to go freelance.=
 I am downsizing for financial reasons.

I am looking to sublet until the end of my lease with the possibility of =
a transfer of lease. (Still waiting to hear back from the building's mana=
gement about this.) In other words, I do not plan to move back in and the=
 apartment will NOT be furnished.

The apartment is a spacious one bedroom on the second floor of a large pr=
e-war building. Before I moved in February 2013, it was repainted and the=
 kitchen and bathroom were fully renovated. Besides its large rooms, ther=
e is lots of counter and storage space. A rare find in New York City!

I've lived here with my cats, but the space would be great for a couple. =
Large bedroom could be partially divided for an office or a nursery.

Dogs and cats are allowed. There are elevators and a very clean laundry r=
oom in the basement.

The building is a block removed from Nostrand Avenue, making it both quie=
t and convenient. A grocery store and numerous 99 cent stores and delis a=
re right around the corner. In addition to existing Caribbean fast food, =
many new bars, cafes, restaurants, and shops have been opening up on Nost=
rand Ave in the last year with no sign of stopping.

A and C trains are 10 minutes to the north, 3 train is 10 minutes to the =
south, SBS to Williamsburg a few blocks away, and local bus to Downtown B=
rooklyn (through Park Slope and Boerum Hill) is a block away.

Rent does not include electric, gas, or internet, which, if the possibili=
ty of transfer of lease remains unclear, can remain in my name and be add=
ed to the rent month to month.

Given the possibility of transfer of lease, your credit score will be con=
sidered. I will also ask for a security deposit, which is NOT the last mo=
nth's rent. The building is rent stabilized, meaning a transfer of lease =
would result in a 18.25% increase in rent.

Hope you like what you see! Please feel free to contact me with any quest=
ions.

I'm on the 3rd floor of a remodeled building that dates to 1897.
If you're a design aficionado and appreciate technology, you'll love this=
 spacious, incredibly quiet apartment. To repaint it, I studied 3 Technic=
olor films from the 40s and 50s and painted each room with very saturated=
 colors, except the small bedroom, which is all white. Then I installed a=
 new floor and had my best pieces of furniture recovered. Finally, I inst=
alled a Hue lighting system that can be controlled by your iPhone or a re=
mote. You can read about the apartment and see photos of it in the Europe=
an design magazine &quot;Apartamento.&quot;

$2,200.00 Per Month, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, 850 sq. ft., Charming Apt in L=
ovely Greenpoint
Available: Oct 01, 2014 through Oct 29, 2014

 In view of the beautiful NYC skyline, this cool and spacious railroad ap=
artment in Greenpoint offers the perfect space for singles or couples.  M=
y girlfriend and I live full-time in the apartment.  I am a social worker=
 and she is a touring musician so we are out of town a lot and would love=
 if other artists or creative people were interested in subletting.

    New hardwood floors are throughout the apartment. The space has a ful=
l kitchen with dishwasher and other appliances. Any avid cook will be at =
home in this space that gets full sunlight all day. The dining room is a =
great place to spend some downtime, listen to a great record collection a=
nd drink a glass of wine. Another room offers a musician's office, with a=
 nice upright piano and work space. The bedroom includes an extremely com=
fortable queen size bed with large windows that get great light throughou=
t the day. From the bed, you get a beautiful view of the New York skyline=
.

Details:

    -4 room apartment (kitchen, dining room with lounge area, office room=
 with upright piano, bedroom)

    -Private bathroom with shower and tub.

    There are no other roommates in this apartment so aside from dropping=
 off and picking up keys, any subletter will have the place to themselves=
 and won't see us a round.  Though, if any issues do arise we are respons=
ive and can be available to help out.

 Neighborhood:

    The apartment is up the street (5 min walk) from the beautiful McGolr=
ick Park, which has a wonderful farmers market on the weekends. 15 min wa=
lk to the G train which gives easy access to Manhattan and other neighbor=
hoods. Lots of trendy bars, restaurants and music venues in the area. A b=
us line that stops right outside of the apartment is also a great transpo=
rtation option for any visitor.
Getting around

Transportation:

- 15 min walk to G train (or 5 min bus ride) which gives easy access to M=
anhattan and other neighborhood.s

g within a block or two of the apartment.

Over the past eight years we have transformed a former steam fitter's sho=
p into an ideal home and work space. It is currently configured as a one =
bedroom, two and a half bath home and studio, but it could easily accommo=
date additional bedrooms. The space could be reconfigured in a variety of=
 ways due to the open plan of the building.

Features of the property include two 7'x7' pyramid skylights, wood and re=
finished concrete floors, a new roof, windows and doors, french doors to =
a large patio, established perennial gardens including a privacy stand of=
 bamboo, stainless steel appliances, washer/dryer, and unique built-ins f=
rom the building's former life. A favorite item is an original 4'x10' woo=
d table that is the centerpiece of the studio space. There is a new 10'x1=
2' wood shed and all of this sits on a quarter acre lot.

$2,500.00 Per Month, East Village, New York, Seeking Sublet in Brooklyn/M=
anhattan or Swap with Portland, OR House
Available: Jan 01, 2015 through Jun 01, 2015

Hi!=20
We are a Portland, OR, based Graphic Designer and PhD Student couple seek=
ing a semester-long sublet for Spring 2015 (from January to end of May). =
We both previously lived in NYC for about seven years, and are interested=
 in either a furnished large studio or one-bedroom with decent proximity =
to a subway line (even the G!). Hip Brooklyn and lower Manhattan preferre=
d, but are open to other options, too.
We have two cats named Toilet and Pepper Jr, which we rescued a few years=
 ago from our backyard in Brooklyn. They are lazy and don't scratch furni=
ture (we value our own fancy chairs and sofas too much to tolerate any me=
ssing around). They crash with friends and family all the time and don't =
destroy their stuff, either.

Another option:
Ideally, we could find someone who would like to do a swap with us for ou=
r furnished three-bedroom, one-bath Portland home. It's a really awesome =
1908 cottage in the super hip Alberta neighborhood with a garden and a bi=
g, sunny detached work studio. It has skylights and french doors, and is =
a beautiful place to hole up and do some work. Our hope is that you are e=
xcited to take a small break from New York City life to have a creative r=
etreat. We sometimes rent it out on AirBnB, so click on the link for addi=
tional photos: https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/2897131

About us:=20
The PhD Student, me, will be teaching at NYU in the Food Studies departme=
nt - I've been writing my dissertation from Portland, but technically I s=
till go to school there. Here's my website: www.hiokinai.com
The Graphic Designer, him, continues to work with his business partner in=
 New York, where most of their client base is located. Here is his person=

 at least 3 months.  I'm not very picky about the size of the room, or am=
ount of roommates.  Just need a place to to keep my stuff and rest my hea=
d. =20

I'm an open book, if you have any questions for me please don't hesitate =
to ask.  Since I am from out of state, I am more than willing to video ch=
at to get a better feel of who I am.  Attached a picture to put a face to=
 the posting.

And again, I am very open to options at this point, so please don't hesit=
ate to contact me if you have an availability.

Hope to here from you!  Thanks!

Hi there! My girlfriend and I are looking for a one bedroom in the Brookl=

 Cobble Hill, Fort Greene) but willing to consider other places as well. =
Our budget is in the $2500-$3000 range maximum, but would be able to mana=
ge a little more for the perfect place. Our ideal apartment would be a re=
novated unit in a brownstone with wood floors and modern appliances, but =
we'll look at anything! Hoping to connect with people in a manner other t=
han craigslist.

A little about us: we're two young professionals in our late 20s who love=
 going to museums and eating/cooking well. We met in Dubai and have just =
moved to New York; I work for Maersk and my girlfriend works for the Worl=
d Bank. We've got until October 15th to find a place so would appreciate =
anyone with leads/an apartment available! Thanks for reading.
Best,

$1,000.00 Per Month, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, Relocating SF--&gt;NYC. Need s=
ublet!
Available: Oct 17, 2014

I am a 29 y/o female relocating from San Francisco to New York this fall.=
 I'm pretty flexible on when, so if you have something that might work fo=
r me, I'd love to hear about it.

I'm open to short-term furnished places and longer-term unfurnished place=
s. Anything, really, that seems like a good fit. I'd prefer Greenpoint bu=
t I'm admittedly a greenhorn so I want to hear about other good neighborh=
oods, too!

I'm keeping my full-time job (M-F, 9-5) in my company's New York office, =
so I am already gainfully employed. Outside of work, I enjoy music, film,=
 writing, photography, random hangs, spontaneous fun, cooking, eating and=
 many other things that are good. I have lived with the same wonderful pe=
ople for five years in SF, so I think I'm pretty good at being a roommate=
. References available on request!

I don't smoke, I do drink. I like to party very occasionally but preferab=
ly at someone else's place. I am allergic to cats but I love dogs.

Feel free to email me if you would like to know more or if you have somet=
hing suitable.

Thanks!

lexible Move-In Date (now / anytime in the upcoming months)
Available: Oct 01, 2014

Dear Prospective Landlord,
I hope this message finds you well.
My name is Sanae,=20
I'm a 32 year old single woman in search of a new home. I would love to b=
ecome your new favorite tenant!

I've lived in my neighborhood for years and it's been over 4 months now t=
hat I've been searching for my new home. I'm really trying to stay in the=
 area and ideally, I need to move anytime before mid-October but can wait=
 for the right space.

I work as a creative, I can do just about anything with regards to aesthe=
tic and design. This means if your space needs a little fixing up, I woul=
d be more than happy to give it some love, its what I do best!

As a tenant I am very quiet and respectful of my space, neighbors, and co=
mmunity. I always pay my bills on time and truly make my space my home an=
d sanctuary. I work a lot and I do not smoke nor have any pets. My presen=
t landlord would be more than happy to give me a really great reference.

I know I'm looking for quite the needle or gem if you will in a haystack =
and I'm really trying to stay in my neighborhood (Fort Greene / Clinton H=
ill) but I'm open to going a little outwards south and west. Fortunately =
I have a lot flexibility with my move-in date, finding the right space is=
 most important to me.

I am looking for an unfurnished pre-war space for long term lease, I'm op=
en to lease take-overs as well.

I love original details and charm, I'm not concerned about renovations, I=
 would be more than happy to do them myself.

I am open to two room / alcove studios but I really think I need a true o=
ne bedroom to accommodate my furniture, I'm aware this will be a difficul=
t find.=20

I'm not looking for a basement/garden apartment.
I'm not looking for a share situation but a place of my own.=20
Thanks for taking the time to read this.=20

Warmest Regards-
Your Future Tenant
