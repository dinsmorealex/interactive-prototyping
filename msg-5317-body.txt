Hello, 

We have a study taking place on Thursday December 5th,
2013 and Monday December 9th , 2013 , in Manhattan, paying $85 via
check. We are looking for males 18 - 55 who own a smartphone or tablet.
There are several time slots available, select the one that works best
for you.

  If you are interested in applying:  

* Visit
www.nyfocusgroups.com/projects [1] 

* Click "apply" next to the group
you are interested in. 

The survey you will be filling out is just an
eligibility survey and you will not be compensated for filling it out.


FAQ

I've been applying for studies, but I haven't been picked. Why?


It could be a number of reasons. Perhaps the study is already full or
you didn't meet all of the criteria we were looking for. Don't be
discouraged! You won't be accepted for every focus group. Keep trying
and you should get an opportunity! 

It could also be that, the number
you provided in you profile isn't working, or you didn't provide a
number for us to reach you. Please take the time to update your profile,
to ensure that you have provided a current phone number. 

Thank you for
your time and if you have any questions please feel free to contact
me.
