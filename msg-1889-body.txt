Good morning,

If you remember, you met one of our sales representatives and they explaine=
d how Green Mountain Energy provides electric power to homes in New York al=
l sourced from local wind farms and small hydro-electric dams upstate. By c=
hoosing to use Green Mountain Energy as your provider, you will be directly=
 financing the growth and development of new and existing renewable energy =
sources while creating local jobs. In fact, the average New Yorker using Gr=
een Mountain over the course of a year has the same effect on the environme=
nt as planting 32 trees!

 All of the New Yorkers who joined Green Mountain last year made a huge imp=
act on our environment, decreasing the amount of carbon emitted equal to ta=
king an entire coal power plant off the grid. But we need every individual =
like yourself to make this combined change.

Your paperwork is all ready, but we didn't get your Con Ed account number. =
Please reply with your account number and I will send your enrollment to Co=
n Ed. If you have any questions, please reply to this email or call me dire=
ctly at 212-710-2721 and I will be glad to assist you.


Thank you for changing the way power is made in New York,


Austin Martinez
