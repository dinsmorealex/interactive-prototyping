So... this week you actually get to decide the future of online privacy.  S=
eriously!=20

As you read this, the Senate is debating their version of CISPA: the "Cyber=
security Act of 2012".  There will be debate and amendments, but a vote can=
 come any day. =20

CISPA--which already passed the House--was awful.  Government got potential=
 access to all your personal data with no restrictions on what they could d=
o with it.    But the Senate bill has some strong privacy protections... fo=
r now. =20

The problem is, a group of anti-privacy Senators and the NSA are pushing am=
endments to remove these protections and bring the Senate bill closer to CI=
SPA.  Our friends in the Senate say that phone lines have been dangerously =
quiet: not enough constituents are calling in support of privacy.  The bill=
 is in the final stages and could easily become law; we need to keep those =
privacy protections in it.  Al Franken and Rand Paul are also supporting a =
pro-privacy amendment that needs our support. =20

Can you call your Senators right now to defend privacy?  http://fightforthe=
future.org/defendprivacy/?state=3DNY

Your call could actually tip the scales.  Thanks to an unrelated battle (mo=
stly along party lines) over whether or not government should regulate the =
systems securing basic infrastructure like power grids, the final vote coul=
d be very close.  If we can convince just a handful of Senators to stand up=
 for our rights to privacy, we can significantly improve the bill or block =
it entirely.=20

This year, grassroots movements defeated SOPA in the US and ACTA in Europe.=
  Wouldn't it be amazing if this latest bad-idea bill also went down in fla=
mes (or at least, got significantly improved)?   Well, you've gotta work a =
little bit to make it happen :)=20

Call both your Senators: http://fightforthefuture.org/defendprivacy/?state=
=3DNY

Thanks all of you,=20
