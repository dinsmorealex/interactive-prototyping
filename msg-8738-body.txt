$575.00 Per Month, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, 200 sq. ft., Charming office/stu=
dio available in prime Greenpoint  (includes utilities)
Available: Jan 01, 2015

A semi-private space is available for sublease in my studio beginning Jan=
uary 1st, approximately 200 square feet for $575, utilities included (hea=
t &amp; electricity). The ceilings are 11 feet high, so it feels larger. =
The entire 600 sq foot studio is shared with two other people - my space =
is in the back and completely private with a door, while your space is in=
 the middle, divided from the other studio with a partial wall, which goe=
s all the way up to the ceiling. There are no windows, but abundant wall =
space and a small storage loft. Perfect for a painter.

The charming space has one exposed brick wall, and original details of wo=
od ceiling, beams and floor. It feels very comfortable and homey in there=
, great place to work. The photos feature my previous studiomates&#39; st=
uff, but it&#39;s best to take a look at it in person and see how you wou=
ld set it up yourself.

There is a freight elevator, mailbox, slop sink, clean bathrooms, and 24-=
hour access to building. Many artists and creative professionals in the b=
uilding.

Amazing, prime location, just 2 blocks from the G at Greenpoint Ave and w=
alking distance to tons of great bars, shops, and restaurants.

I prefer someone with a quiet practice - no woodworking (occasional is ok=
), loud machines, or toxic materials. It&#39;s also preferable if you wor=
k mostly nights and weekends since I work mostly weekdays, but not a requ=
isite. Also, I&#39;m only renting to an individual to keep the # of peopl=
e in the space to a minimum, no duos or groups. I require first month&#39=
;s rent plus 2 months security deposit. The lease is for one year, but if=
 you need to leave before then, you can give me 45 days notice.=20

$650.00 Per Month, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 500 sq. ft., $650/month 1-2 sp=
ots available - Photo Studio w/ shared desk area
Available: Jan 01, 2015

Looking for 1 ($1100) or possibly 2 ($650 ea) photographers to share 2 co=
nnected spaces in the heart of Williamsburg (near grand and union). Each =
space is roughly 250sf w/ 14&#39; ceilings. 24 hour access, excellent hea=
t, ground floor, wifi &amp; utilities included. Short term or long term p=
ossible. No living.

The first space is a dedicated photo studio. I just took this space over,=
 painted and set it up. Perfect for full length portraits, fashion, still=
 life, tests, etc. It&#39;s clean, simple and nice. 3 roll seamless syste=
m, c-stands, rolling boom, etc. I also have 6 monolights with light modif=
iers you&#39;re welcome to use. We&#39;d work out a suitable shooting sch=
edule between everyone.

The second space is used as desk/work and storage space. In the picture i=
t&#39;s set up for just me but we can arrange accordingly. There&#39;s no=
t a ton of space for excess storage but we can accommodate some gear, pri=
nters, etc. I have a new Epson 3880 and an Epson R1900 which we can work =
something out with if you like or BYOPrinter. Space also has a Keurig cof=
fee machine, small fridge, microwave, laser printer, tables, desk chair, =
and mounting finishing area.=20

Obviously, the space is geared towards photographers but I will consider =
other artists (video editing, designer, etc. But no toxic materials or mu=
sicians). First months rent and 1 month deposit.

There are other 5 other artist spaces and a gallery in front which all wo=
rk very well together. Everyone is quiet, respectful, and motivated. Good=
 manners all around. The front gallery has a monthly curated show and I&#=
39;m considering curating shows in the photostudio about 3-4 times a year=
 in conjunction with the front gallery openings. The neighborhood has goo=
d restaurants and all that good stuff.

We&#39;re looking for a warm, respectful artist to join this great open s=
tudio share. It is currently filled with videographers, a photographer, a=
nd an illustrator.  We&#39;re all friends, and we&#39;d like to keep the =
atmosphere very generous and open. We regularly share equipment, and help=
 out with each other&#39;s projects.

The artist-run studio is located in a three-unit building in Bushwick, ju=
st a couple blocks from the Morgan L stop. It&#39;s about 15 minutes to U=
nion Square.

The 1500 square-foot interior and 14-9 foot sloping ceilings, 24-hour acc=
ess and skylight, allows for an airy, easily sharable space. There are ha=
rdwood floors and lots of sunlight.=20

hoto and video shoots as well as other projects at any time. There is a 9=
-foot seamless mounted support that can be shared for green screen and ma=
ny colored backgrounds.

Each artist has space for a couple desks, shelves, and there is storage a=
vailable. The space is undivided to keep it open and flexible.=20

The current spot open has a view of downtown Manhattan (see the image of =
the desk).

There are many coffee shops and bars within a couple blocks, a 24-hour de=
li is three blocks away (a new 24-hour diner is opening across the street=
), as well as Roberta&#39;s Pizza, Momo Sushi, El Fogon, and so on.

Rent is $500 each, plus utilities, which can range from $20-40 usually. I=
 wish it wasn&#39;t this expensive, but that&#39;s how the prices are now=
.

A couch, refrigerator, slop sink, wifi, in-studio bathroom, sky light, ro=
of access, and track lighting make this a great place to work.

Come see it in the evening or on a weekend. The spot is open 1/15/15 or p=
ossibly earlier.=20

It looks a lot larger in person

io Sublet

Available: Jan 05, 2015 through Apr 15, 2015

I will be traveling for several months and am subletting my space in a la=
rge, open art studio. The studio is shared by 5 artists, each with our ow=
n individual workspaces. The space is incredibly bright, with tons of win=
dows, a community conference table, and a slop sink and bathroom in the s=
tudio. My studio-mates all work in the studio on different schedules, so =
there are rarely more than one or two other people there at the same time=
. They are quiet and respectful and like to keep the space reasonably tid=
y, as they sometimes have visitors, curators, etc. coming through. The st=
udio is on the 3rd floor of a walkup building, which is well-maintained a=
nd generally clean.

The location of the studio is convenient to just about every subway line,=
 and is one block from Whole Foods and dozens of good restaurants.

Please note - I will be storing materials and supplies in the studio, so =
there is a limited amount of storage space for someone subletting.  Howev=
er, the workspaces will all cleared and available for your use. =20

I will be showing the space beginning Weds. Dec 31.  If you are intereste=
d, please let me know the dates you are looking for and a little about th=
e type of work you will be doing in the studio. Thanks!

$1,250.00 Per Month, Ditmas Park, Brooklyn, 325 sq. ft., 1 Bedroom AND Ar=
t Studio/Office in a 4 Bedroom House!
Available: Jan 15, 2015 through Aug 31, 2015

I&#39;m leaving my beautiful house in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn and am lookin=
g for someone to sublet/take over the lease until the end of August. It&#=
39;s a beautiful Victorian house with a front porch, back yard, garden an=
d koi pond with a trickling water feature. (I&#39;m serious).  There&#39;=
s also laundry in the house, a dishwasher and a space that I use as an ar=
t studio, but could be an office or a meditation space.  I share the top =
two floors with 3 of the most amazing women in Brooklyn. All professional=
 women in their 30&#39;s and all either artists and/or life coaches. They=
 are really my family away from home and you should expect me visiting my=
 girls regularly.  My room is big and bright with great morning light and=
 a view of a pretty church. Rent is $1,250 with first, last and security =
on move in. I&#39;m hoping for someone either January 1st or 15th.  You s=
hould be friendly, relatively clean, responsible, willing to contribute t=
o house chores, and while it&#39;s not a requirement to socialize with th=
e rest of the house, everyone is very busy and works a lot, but we do lik=
e to come together for an occasional meal, dinner party, movie night, etc=
.  Please let me know if you&#39;re interested, or pass it along to someo=
ne who might be!

$950.00 Per Month, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 100 sq. ft., Room for Rent in =
Great/Cozy Williamsburg Loft
Available: Jan 11, 2015

We are a couple (in our late 30s) (with 2 cats) looking for a roommate fo=
r the 3rd bedroom in our space. Rent is $950 per month, including utiliti=
es &amp; wireless internet.  Additional $15 per month for shared househol=
d supplies. 1 month deposit.=20

The room is furnished with a mattress in a lofted bed area, table/desk, g=
iant mirror, couch, clothing bar, etc. The bed is lofted. Definitely a qu=
irky/cool built structure that not everyone can appreciate You have a win=
dow to the alley so its not too cave-like. We have a full sized mattress =
 but can remove it and store it if you have your own. Desk and mirror is =
attached to wall and cannot be removed. Couch can be tossed if you dont l=
ike it.=20

The amazing part of our house is the common space.  It is a large area, w=
ith a big table, communal bookshelves, a couple of couches, and a swing. =
It is a great space for a dinner party, activist meeting, or place to spr=
ead out and work on a project. Sometimes it is really clean &amp; fancy, =
sometimes it is cluttered and crazy.  We all pitch in together (via a fun=
 chore chart) to keep it as tidy as possible. Because the rooms are small=
 and crazy, we spend a lot of time together in the common space. =20

We share one bathroom between the 3 of us. A lovely Shower + Bath

We have a fully stocked kitchen with a lot of &quot;shared&quot; cooking =
equipment, spices, etc.  We love to cook and the kitchen is for sure the =
most active part of the house.  We run a farm share so our kitchen tends =
to overflow with fresh local vegetables and fruits. And the freezer is st=
oked with our meat share...Lots of canning, pickling, and kitchen project=
s abound. We are not at all a veg/vegan kitchen --even though we cook up =
a lot of vegan/vegetarian stuff-- but we can respect veggie only pans,etc=
.

The Rules &amp; Other Vital House Info
Common space has a bog old tv for movie nights and stuff like that.  We l=
ike to go out and do up NYC but also like to create a haven from all that=
 noise...

In order to keep a clean ship, we have a weekly chore chart. Every roomma=
te has a (rotating) weekly chore. In order to keep things fair, each room=
mate is required to buy 6 rolls of TP and $15 of cleaning supplies per mo=
nth.=20

There are no locks on rooms, but everyone is respectful of roommates priv=
acy. Except the cats. They know no bounds....Fortunately they arent destr=
uctive, just curious.  We like to hang out and socialize with our roomate=
s but also respect privacy. The rooms are all small so there tends to be =
a healthy mixture of communal conversation and the ability to hide away p=
laying video games in your room solo....

We have lived in the neighborhood for 12 years so we have friends that st=
op by and we know all the neighbors, etc. Semi-social apartment but way m=
ore dinner party style than late night party pad. To be honest, this plac=
e will not work for you if you are a late night socialite--it is a real c=
ool place to bring people back to after the bar and whatnot, however, tha=
t doesn&#39;t fly here. Sorry, we go quiet after midnight!!

We have 2 cats in the house. 4 year old frisky brothers (Sorry, no more c=
ats. Or rather, if you have a cat we would have to have a serious discuss=
ion about making a pack. No dogs.) The cats are pretty social and nosey. =
Not a do-able situation for anyone with cat allergies. (In fact, you may =
just have to love cats in order to live here. ;)

We have built a container garden out front on the street. We have loading=
 dock doors that open up onto the street for a cool lil outdoor space. (I=
t is sealed up during winter)

The Roommates
Right now there is 1 girl &amp; 1 guy making up our household.  (Full dis=
closure -- we are a couple just celebrated our 10 year anniversary. Have =
been living together for 3 years). Both of us work in the neighborhood an=
d tend to eat lunch at home. We rent 2 bedrooms  using one to sleep and t=
he other as office. We are looking for someone who can fit nicely into th=
e mix. It is a fun, mellow, supportive household. We have had some amazin=
g roommates and hope to continue the streak of good stuff...=20

About us...
ryan (the girl) has lived in the building for 12 years.  Worked as a tena=
nt organizer- now as a landlord&#39;s assistant. Has lots of bikes and bo=
oks in the apartment. Slowly writing a sci-fi novel.
yolim works as a welder by day. Makes crazy sculpture and tetris shaped b=
ookshelves by night.=20

So, if this all sounds good to you, please email us to set up an appointm=
ent to come check out the space and us. Also, include answers to the foll=
owing questions (and any other info you want to add!)

	age and other vitals
	what you do in  nyc
	how long in nyc
	hobbies and other likes
	typical week and weekend routine

Have a good one.

The building: We are on fourth floor of a massive former doll factory wit=
h a freight elevator for convenient move-in! This building is home mostly=
 to artists and is still used as factory (printing; knitting) on the lowe=
r floors. It&#39;s located in the eastern-most part of East Williamsburg =
(practically Bushwick) and is walkable to various supermarkets (including=
 a coop), bars, restaurants, a park, a couple 24-hour grocery stores, and=
 a taco joint everyone seems to know about. The Jefferson L train station=
 is a four minute walk.=20

The kitchen: We may not all be vegetarians, but no meat is allowed in the=
 apartment (except in the form of cat food). Each roommate has a designat=
ed section in the pantry and (super awesome new spaceship-like) fridge. W=
e all cook on a regular basis. We would probably secretly make fun of you=
 if you eat processed food all the time, though we all have been known to=
 buy the occasional box of macaroni and cheese. The kitchen is (very much=
) so fully equipped. There&#39;s a dishwasher and we all make an effort t=
o keep the sink clear and wipe the counters regularly. We&#39;re good lik=
e that.=20

The living room: We have a projector (owned by one, but shared), a 19&#39=
; projection screen, and good taste in film. There&#39;s also speakers th=
roughout the common areas (even the shower). There are a variety of plant=
s in the common area (I lost count at 125). Plants you do not need to tak=
e care of because someone who lives here is obsessed with them. There&#39=
;s also a bike rack so you don&#39;t have to leave your ride on the stree=
t. Oh, and we have two (and a half) untuned pianos and a Wurlitzer organ.=
=20

The pets: We have two high quality male felines that live with us. There&=
#39;s Boans, a very dignified dude who was adopted four years ago, and Fa=
ce, our extremely friendly buddy rescued from under the (former) Rockaway=
 boardwalk. Robots feed the cats and sift their shit, so don&#39;t worry =
about that. We&#39;d consider other small pets on a pet by pet basis.=20

The roommates: You would have five roommates. Some are home often, some a=
re home rarely. We&#39;re all in our mid-to-late 20&#39;s (other ages are=
 totally ok). Currently we are one female and five males (not sure that e=
ver matters to anyone). We&#39;re totally accepting and open to any orien=
tation/gender/whatever. Many of us are night-people and movie watching so=
metimes goes to the early am hours (a warning if you need to be up early)=
. Some work freelance, others go to work at various times in the morning.=
 We all get along great. Our interests include various things such as des=
ign, film, horticulture, food, music, obsessive organizing, cooking, writ=
ing length descriptions, getting high, getting laid, etc etc. You should =
be ok living with: people who consume alcohol and other various dissociat=
ives on the regular; atheists; and people who didn&#39;t fit in during (o=
r go to) high school.=20
We hold totally normal jobs such as: leather bag maker, graphic designer,=
 vintage seller, synthesizer repair man, and fabricator.=20

Please tell us about yourself or link us to your facebook/instagram if th=
at&#39;s your style.=20
I can do the same for you. (mine is instagram.com/launachgewahren where t=
here are pics of the place/cats occasionally)

I&#39;ve said a lot, and hope I&#39;ve covered everything. Message me wit=
h any questions or to set up a time to come by. Between 7pm-midnight is b=
est (more roommates will be around).=20

$2,000.00 Per Month, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 1200 sq. ft., Bedroom availa=

Available: Jan 01, 2015 through Mar 31, 2015

1, 2 or 3 months. Maybe longer.=20
Looking for roommate to share my Amazing Loft.=20
2 full and private bedrooms, queen size beds, windows all over the loft (=
15 total), high ceilings, cozy, very clean, 1 bathroom, WiFi Internet. =20=

The neighborhood is one of the best, hip neighborhoods in Brooklyn. Full =

es. Most importantly - Very Safe area -

Please email me if you have any questions.

The first artists moved to Williamsburg in the 1970s, drawn by the low re=
nts, large spaces available and convenient transportation, one subway sto=
p from Manhattan. This continued through the 1980s and increased signific=
antly in the 1990s as earlier destinations such as SoHo and the East Vill=
age became gentrified. The community was small at first, but by 1996 Will=
iamsburg had accumulated an artist population of about 3,000.[39] Willia=
msburg and Greenpoint are served by a monthly galleries listings magazine=
, wagmag. Theater is also represented by indie theater spaces such as The=
 Brick Theater and The Charlie Pineapple Theater.

Many legitimate commercial music venues opened in the neighborhood includ=
ing Pete&#39;s Candy Store, Union Pool, Northsix (now Music Hall of Willi=
amsburg), and Galapagos (now Public Assembly). Several Manhattan-based ve=
nues also opened locations, including Bowery Presents (who bought Northsi=
x and transformed it to Music Hall of Williamsburg), Luna Lounge, Knittin=
g Factory, and Cake Shop. In the summers of (phone number hidden), and 20=
08, events including concerts, movies, and dance performances were staged=
 at the previously abandoned pool at McCarren Park in Greenpoint. In 2009=
, these pool parties are now held at The Williamsburg Waterfront. I&#39;v=
e lived in the apt for over 10 years but I travel a lot. I&#39;m the leas=
e holder. I have a roommate right now staying for 1 month. I work with hi=
m on an Internet radio show once a week. He works from 9 to 6pm everyday =
(weekdays) I&#39;ll be showing the space or the housekeeper.

ave a tiny lofted nook in the living room over our tiny library. Two smal=
l couches, one suitable for sleeping lounging, and a radio/ music player =
in the living room. Wifi is good. Its nice here!

You can walk 15 minutes in any direction and be in a different neighborho=
od. Things are always popping up around here. Constant change, just like =
the rest of NYC. I like the Black Swan near Bedford Nostrand, and the Kol=
ache coffee house. In the other direction, Bizarre is fun, or Goodbye Blu=
e Mondays. Or go to the Silent Barn Artist Collective to see what they ar=
e up to.

The buses are super close and great. B38, B43, B52. Walking is good too, =
its 15 minutes in any direction to a new neighborhood. I often walk to th=
e JM train at Myrtle/ Bro

You&#39;ll be staying with my two roommates who can help you out if you n=
eed anything. I&#39;ll be out of the country and available only by email.=


You can eat anything in the fridge, just please replace what you eat. And=
 do your own dishes!

No smoking in the house, but we have a nice fire escape off of the living=
 room.

ting his PHD in literature (and playing in a punk band) and an ESL teache=

ple who are super welcoming and easy-going. We love to cook (especially J=
apanese), go out to shows, watch lots of films and make things.

y place to relax and unwind or get some work done. Our space is also exce=
llent for hosting friends and guests from out of town (we have a really c=
omfortable sofa that folds out into a queen-sized bed) and having people =
over for dinner/drinks.

We also have a lovely cat. Apologies if you are allergic or have pets of =
your own but we are unable accommodate more animals.

bathroom in my apartment. Must be clean, respectful, and understand how t=
o share a common living space.

 a full basement for storage purposes as well!
The building is a classic Astoria three-floor house, we are on the second=
 floor. We will share a large kitchen with plenty of cupboards and storag=
e, a living/dining room and balcony. There are lots of windows and great =

1500 security deposit + $1500 first months rent, (prorated depending on m=
ove-in date) not including utilities.This opportunity is for six months, =

 the beauty of Astoria. Ditmars boasts an incredible array of Greek seafo=
od restaurants, tons of pizza, sushi, Thai, Australian, some of the best =
bagels in NY (no, really, I&#39;m not making that up), a beer and cheese =

ven more fun stuff including multiple gyms and Urgent Care.
The N/Q is the best train in the city and can get you to Manhattan in 15 =
minutes. We are also near a number of buses that will take you further in=
to Queens, Brooklyn or other parts of Manhattan. Also, only a five minute=
 cab ride to LaGuardia. This is also very car-friendly area, with plenty =
of street parking and from here its very easy to skirt the city to go ups=
tate for hiking or to Long Island for the beach!

Our apartment&#39;s in the center of Williamsburg, at the Ainslie Tower. =
We&#39;re near the cross section of Union &amp; Metropolitan, also the Lo=
rimer stop on the L train is on the same block as our building. We&#39;re=
 only looking for someone to come in for 6 months right now because we&#3=
9;re already half way through our current lease. Our current third roomma=
te&#39;s leaving on the 22nd of January. so we&#39;re lookin&#39; for som=
eone that can come in from February - July.

The apartment&#39;s got really high ceilings and huge windows. Originally=
 a 2 bedroom, but we converted part of the living room into the 3rd bedro=
om. The downside of the 3rd bedroom is that the walls don&#39;t go all th=
e way up cause the ceilings are pretty high, so you can pretty much hear =
everything in the kitchen and living room, and it&#39;s not such a big ro=
om, but right now our third roommate has a full mattress in there and the=
re&#39;s enough space for a desk as well. The great thing about the 3rd b=
edroom is that you get your own balconette, huge windows with a corner vi=
ew of brooklyn and the manhattan skyline. Feel free to google The Ainslie=
 Tower to check it out.

We have two bathrooms, one I share with the third roommate and the other =
is used by my other roommate which is closer to his bedroom which is at t=
he other side of the apartment.

As for the whole apartment, we&#39;ve got a dishwasher, washer/dryer, cen=
tralized air, and a huge balcony/terrace with the manhattan skyline as a =
view. It&#39;s around 20 ft x 20 ft. Also the building&#39;s got elevator=
s and a doorman, and we&#39;re on the 8th floor.

The rent is 1600 each, not including utilities. The utilities is more or =
less like 100+ every month, but considering the location and all the diff=
erent perks you get, it&#39;s a pretty amazing deal.

Summary:
Rent - 1600/month
Utilities - 100+/month
Lease - 6 Months
Move In Date - February 1st

If you&#39;re interested, please do hit me up on my email.
and tell me about yourself, and we&#39;d be happy to introduce ourselves =
as well. I&#39;m 21, and my roommate&#39;s 20, both guys, open to guys or=
 girls, and we&#39;d be happy to have someone around our age or a little =
older (18-28)

Mighty thanks!

$750.00 Per Month, Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, 100 sq. ft. sq. ft., $750/mo sm=
all bedroom in 4-bedroom Boerum Hill brownstone with high ceilings. Utili=
ties (wifi, gas, electric) approx. $50/mo.
Available: Jan 01, 2015 through Jan 31, 2015

Temporary room, preferably for a thirty-something female. Extending beyon=
d January, negotiable. Futon bed (likely) available, if needed.

Hi There:
Small (100 sq ft) private bedroom in a large, shared, apartment in the gl=
orious guts of Brooklyn. Hardwood floors, closet, and a tiny window (with=
 an excellent brick-wall view). Spacious, sun-drenched community area (bo=
ok club!), tiny bathroom with claw-foot tub, and roomy kitchen are shared=
 by 3 females, all health-minded and hopelessly charming: a special educa=
tion teacher, a theater design professional, and a fabulous filmmaker. We=
 are all in our thirties and mostly vegetarians (apart from some bacon sl=
ip-ups).

Maybe Yes:
If you cherish community, are thoughtful and live well with others, don&#=
39;t mind an annoying cleaning schedule, enjoy a family meal, or a glass =
of wine on occasion (daily), are an ambitious working professional, appre=
ciate details like worn yet beautiful mouldings, old brick and marble fir=
eplaces (so much potential), but can live with the slightly worn wood flo=
ors, the occasionally peeling paint, that one random green wall (oops), a=
nd the 20 somethings playing video games and having healthy screaming mat=
ches below? (Ear plugs. Seriously.) Then you just might dig this place.=20=


Maybe No:
Do you take excessively long showers, leave dishes in the sink, misuse th=
e em dash, have a boyfriend or cousin who stays over a lot, dance with li=
ght sticks, smoke anything? Maybe this will not be the best fit.

Fun Facts:
3 blocks from Atlantic/Pacific with access to one-bizillion subway lines.=
 (The Fulton st. G is near as well.) Walking distance to Prospect Park, 1=
 block outside Park Slope. Near Beacon&#39;s Closet, Barclay&#39;s Center=
 (sports!) 4th Ave &amp; Pacific Standard Bars, Gorilla Coffee, BAM, Park=
 Slope Coop, Barbes (the best music venue on earth)...

Please tell us a bit about yourself. Thank you!

with red walls), overlooking the garden (we don&#39;t have access to the =

ceful and cozy.=20

Also, bonus: this unit has a washing machine!! It&#39;s a combo washer/dr=

crafting, playing cards, spending time outdoors, etc. I&#39;d love to liv=
e with someone who I can vibe with, someone who lives life fully and is i=
nterested in connecting and community!

Sorry, but no couples and no dogs! Cats are ok though. $1600 is the price=
 for the bedroom plus office.=20

If you are interested, please email me with the following information:
1. Full name
2. Contact info

$2,200.00 Per Month, West Village, New York, Charming village studio for =

Available: Jan 07, 2015 through Mar 15, 2015

My efficient and comfortable studio has a true city feeling. It is centra=
lly located on a quiet street, just three blocks from the Hudson River Pa=
rk.=20

The one room apartment is available for weekly or monthly rental from Jan=
 - March. It is cozy, quiet, and very clean and faces the back of the bui=
lding and shared garden space. The apartment is a nice oasis with a high =
speed internet connection, air conditioner, fresh linens, and good mini s=
peakers. Sorry, no tv, but lots of books. The sofa is also the single bed=
 so it is only suitable for 1 person. No couples please. Mature, discreet=
 guest preferred.

Also, please note there is currently repair work to the outside of my bui=
lding and it may not be peaceful during weekdays if you are home. I want =
to be upfront about the 4 workers who are generally present in and around=
 the building from 9-4:30 Mon - Fri. I can honestly say the noise level i=
sn&#39;t terrible, but it is a presence. When they leave, however, it&#39=
;s very very quiet. I&#39;m not sure how much work will be done during th=
e winter months.

The neighborhood is quaint with lots of cafes and boutique shopping and t=
ree-lined streets and it&#39;s a short walk to the Hudson River parks. Lo=
cation is close to most subway lines. (A, C, E, D, B, F, L, M, 1, 2, 3)

$3,400.00 Per Month, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, 950 sq. ft., Big, bright, beau=
tiful furnished loft with city view
Available: Jan 10, 2015 through Mar 10, 2015

My fully furnished, 950sf open loft is a luminous, welcoming, and extreme=
ly comfortable daily feast of sunshine, space, whimsy, and sparkling city=
 views on hip Franklin Street in safe and beautiful Greenpoint. I&#39;m h=
oping to find a person or couple who will love and respect it like their =
own from January 10th(ish) through March 10th(ish). As you might be gathe=
ring from the &#39;ish&#39;es, there&#39;s some flexibility with dates. $=
3500/month covers rent, all utilities, and wifi.=20

More Details:=20

- It&#39;s a real charmer. 12&#39; ceilings give the apartment an airy fe=
el. Exposed brick wall frames 3 large West-facing windows that sun pours =
through during that day and that fills the space with sunset colors as th=
e evening comes. Decor is a tasteful, eclectic mix of thoughtfully select=
ed antique and new pieces, hand-crafted objects, happy green plants (that=
 it would mean the world to me if you could be a doting foster parent to)=
 and a collection of natural artifacts (lots of crystals). And! There&#39=
;s a million ways to lounge and relax - big couch (with 2 chaises), a flo=
kati rug with 4&quot; of memory foam under it, incredibly comfortable que=
en bed. Super soft, luxurious/high-quality bedding and linens too :)

-Bathroom is new, super clean, modern, marble tiled, has a shower/tub, an=
d is quite large by NYC standards

-Kitchen is simple and compact, but has all the basics and a few extras (=
Omega juicer, KitchenAid mixer, etc). Unfortunately, the dishwasher seen =
in the pics is not currently working.

- Because there&#39;s no street (thus no street traffic) between the apar=
tment and the river, you can enjoy a level of quiet that is quite rare fo=
r NYC

- 2nd floor of a walk-up

- Roof has one of the more magnificent views of NYC that I (and anyone wh=
o visits) has ever seen!

- Neighborhood is amazing - lots of awesome restaurants, bars, and shops =
in close walking distance. Greenpoint Ave G-train station and ferry stati=
on are each about a 7-minute walk away. Walk to Williamsburg in 20-25 min=
s.

If interested, please drop a line or two about yourself and your needs, i=
n addition to any questions that you might have about my place. Thank you=
!

Photography, $150.00, The NYC boroughs, The NYC boroughs, Affordable phot=
ography for your art
Available: Dec 31, 2014 through Feb 28, 2015

I recently moved to NYC.  I have being taking photos for private collecti=
ons, high profile installations, galleries and museums (Japan, Mexico and=
 USA). I&#39;m interested in the process as much as the final piece.=20

Here is a link to my work:
http://www.wvdesign.co/photo.html

The main intent behind my photo aesthetics is to show the detail of the p=
iece not as an archival documentation, but as a piece needed to be apprec=
iated in person. To offer a fine introduction to the experience created b=
y the artist.

The work is done at the artist studio or outdoors using natural light.
The session is only 150dll and it will include 10 professionally edited p=
hotos.

Because no artist is the same nor the art, other special shootings can be=
 arranged.=20
Interviews are conducted before the shooting to ensure the best outcome. =
 =20
On top of everything I can even provide professional advice for digital d=
esigns and printing needs.=20

I look forward to photograph amazing interesting art.

Deposit: $1000 </p><p>Furniture/included: Full size bed with sheets and b=
lankets (if needed); large dresser; closet with hangers; desk with chair;=
 bedside table; lamps. </p><p>The building: We are on fourth floor of a m=
assive former doll factory with a freight elevator for convenient move-in=
! This building is home mostly to artists and is still used as factory (p=
rinting; knitting) on the lower floors. It&#39;s located in the eastern-m=
ost part of East Williamsburg (practically Bushwick) and is walkable to v=
arious supermarkets (including a coop), bars, restaurants, a park, a coup=
le 24-hour grocery stores, and a taco joint everyone seems to know about.=
 The Jefferson L train station is a four minute walk.=20
</p><p>The kitchen: We may not all be vegetarians, but no meat is allowed=
 in the apartment (except in the form of cat food). Each roommate has a d=
esignated section in the pantry and (super awesome new spaceship-like) fr=
idge. We all cook on a regular basis. We would probably secretly make fun=
 of you if you eat processed food all the time, though we all have been k=
nown to buy the occasional box of macaroni and cheese. The kitchen is (ve=
ry much) so fully equipped. There&#39;s a dishwasher and we all make an e=
ffort to keep the sink clear and wipe the counters regularly. We&#39;re g=
ood like that.=20
</p><p>The living room: We have a projector (owned by one, but shared), a=
 19&#39; projection screen, and good taste in film. There&#39;s also spea=
kers throughout the common areas (even the shower). There are a variety o=
f plants in the common area (I lost count at 125). Plants you do not need=
 to take care of because someone who lives here is obsessed with them. Th=
ere&#39;s also a bike rack so you don&#39;t have to leave your ride on th=
e street. Oh, and we have two (and a half) untuned pianos and a Wurlitzer=
 organ. </p><p>The pets: We have two high quality male felines that live =
with us. There&#39;s Boans, a very dignified dude who was adopted four ye=
ars ago, and Face, our extremely friendly buddy rescued from under the (f=
ormer) Rockaway boardwalk. Robots feed the cats and sift their shit, so d=

 any questions.</p><p>The first artists moved to Williamsburg in the 1970=
s, drawn by the low rents, large spaces available and convenient transpor=
tation, one subway stop from Manhattan. This continued through the 1980s =
and increased significantly in the 1990s as earlier destinations such as =
SoHo and the East Village became gentrified. The community was small at f=
irst, but by 1996 Williamsburg had accumulated an artist population of ab=
out 3,000.[39] Williamsburg and Greenpoint are served by a monthly galle=
ries listings magazine, wagmag. Theater is also represented by indie thea=
ter spaces such as The Brick Theater and The Charlie Pineapple Theater.</=
p><p>Many legitimate=20
commercial music venues opened in the neighborhood including Pete&#39;s C=
andy Store, Union Pool, Northsix (now Music Hall of Williamsburg), and Ga=
lapagos (now Public Assembly). Several Manhattan-based venues also opened=
 locations, including Bowery Presents (who bought Northsix and transforme=
d it to Music Hall of Williamsburg), Luna Lounge, Knitting Factory, and C=
ake Shop. In the summers of (phone number hidden), and 2008, events inclu=
ding concerts, movies, and dance performances were staged at the previous=
ly abandoned pool at McCarren Park in Greenpoint. In 2009, these pool par=
ties are now held at The Williamsburg Waterfront. I&#39;ve lived in the a=
pt for over 10 years but I travel a lot. I&#39;m the lease holder. I have=
 a roommate right now staying for 1 month. I work with him on an Internet=

Your room is at the end of the apartment. It is a large master with pictu=

ere is enough room for a king size bed, dressers, desk, even a couch, arm=
chair... Whether or not the room will be furnished is negotiable. We have=
 a full basement for storage purposes as well! <br>
The building is a classic Astoria three-floor house, we are on the second=
 floor. We will share a large kitchen with plenty of cupboards and storag=
e, a living/dining room and balcony. There are lots of windows and great =
light, the apartment is recently remodeled with hardwood floors, new appl=
iances and air-conditioning units. <br>
Pets MAY be allowed- case by case basis. <br>
Move in date between January 15 and February 1 - as you like. I require $=
1500 security deposit + $1500 first months rent, (prorated depending on m=
ove-in date) not including utilities.This opportunity is for six months, =
ending in June, but that may also be negotiable if you would like to be h=
ere longer. <br>
Finally, a word about the neighborhood for those who have yet to discover=
 the beauty of Astoria. Ditmars boasts an incredible array of Greek seafo=
od restaurants, tons of pizza, sushi, Thai, Australian, some of the best =
bagels in NY (no, really, I&#39;m not making that up), a beer and cheese =
specialty shop/bar/cafe, as well as two new fantastic coffee shops, a few=
 bars, an adorable French cafe, and a 24-hour CVS. There are grocery stor=
es galore, some great food carts, and we are a short bus ride away from e=
ven more fun stuff including multiple gyms and Urgent Care. <br>
The N/Q is the best train in the city and can get you to Manhattan in 15 =
minutes. We are also near a number of buses that will take you further in=
to Queens, Brooklyn or other parts of Manhattan. Also, only a five minute=
 cab ride to LaGuardia. This is also very car-friendly area, with plenty =
of street parking and from here its very easy to skirt the city to go ups=

the 3rd bedroom is that the walls don&#39;t go all the way up cause the c=

e NYC boroughs, The NYC boroughs, Affordable photography for your art</p>=
<p>Available: Dec 31, 2014 through Feb 28, 2015</p><p>I recently moved to=
 NYC. I have being taking photos for private collections, high profile in=
stallations, galleries and museums (Japan, Mexico and USA). I&#39;m inter=
ested in the process as much as the final piece. </p><p>Here is a link to=
 my work: <br>
http://www.wvdesign.co/photo.html</p><p>The main intent behind my photo a=
esthetics is to show the detail of the piece not as an archival documenta=
tion, but as a piece needed to be appreciated in person. To offer a fine =
introduction to the experience created by the artist.</p><p>The work is d=
one at the artist studio or outdoors using natural light. <br>
The session is only 150dll and it will include 10 professionally edited p=
hotos.</p><p>Because no artist is the same nor the art, other special sho=
otings can be arranged. <br>
Interviews are conducted before the shooting to ensure the best outcome. =
<br>
On top of everything I can even provide professional advice for digital d=
esigns and printing needs. </p><p>I look forward to photograph amazing in=
teresting art. <br>
