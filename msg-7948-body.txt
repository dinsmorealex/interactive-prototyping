Label News

Hi everyone, just hitting you with a quick mid-month update.
Unfortunately no new releases on Sorry State at the moment, though I'm
hopeful that we'll have the Louder LP up for sale by the end of
October. In addition to that, new releases from Davidians, Dark Ages,
Gay Kiss, Oblivionation, and Skemata are coming along, and we just got
test presses for new records by Broken Prayer and No Love that sound
great. More on those in a couple of weeks, though.

For now, this is mostly to let you know all of the great records that
have come through the distro so far this month. Unfortunately a few
really hot items have already come and gone, including two new
releases from Ausmuteants, the new Buck Biloxi 12", and this awesome
zine and cassette pack devoted to the almighty Screamers. We'll be
restocking all three eventually, but in the meantime check out all of
the other great stuff that's still here!

Featured Distro Items

Dia Final: demo cassette (self-released)
Demo cassette from this new band featuring a bunch of veterans of the
Los Angeles punk scene. This is an absolutely explosive demo
cassette... the music is built around pretty simple 1-2 drumming and
strong and simple punk riffs, but something about the performance here
just jumps out of the speakers. It definitely bears a little bit of
resemblance to the whole Ruleta Rusa / Peligro Social style, but the
production is much more raw, the vocals have more of a kind of snotty,
'77 flavor that recalls bands like the Stitches, and the music is much
more straightforward and stripped-down. Dia Final definitely aren't
reinventing the wheel, but with this style either you sound explosive
or you don't, and this one will knock you on your ass.

Institute: Salt 12" (Sacred Bones)
Brand new 12" from this Austin, TX punk band, and as you can expect
there's a slight uptick in production quality now that they've moved
to Sacred Bones. However, this doesn't mean so much that the
production is "better," but rather than that it's even more spot-on in
terms of replicating the sound of Institute's clear influences.
Seriously, there are moments on this record where I have to honestly
ask myself, "did I put on the Zounds LP by mistake?" The lead guitar
tone is literally almost an exact match. I'm sure that some people
will dismiss them as a soundalike band, but  I really like Institute,
and I think this is easily their strongest material yet... the clearer
production really serves them well, and the lead guitar lines in
particular here are just absolutely infectious. It seems like lots of
bands lay claim to a Crisis / Zounds influence, but it's really
striking how much Institute sound like those bands, and honestly the
music is of just as high quality. I've been playing this over and over
since we got it in and I don't think it's going to leave the turntable
any time soon.

Pura Mania: Musica Para Genta Fea 7" (CV)
Pura Mania: La Estafa Musical 7" (CV)
So, even though these are two separate releases, I'm going to write
one description to cover both... these appear to have been recorded at
the same session, and the concurrent release time and similar artwork
seem to imply that they are meant to be considered together. Now that
I have that out of the way I can say GET BOTH OF THESE RECORDS RIGHT
NOW!!!! Seriously, I can't remember the last time I've fallen this
head over heels for a band. Pura Mania have one of the most original,
exciting sounds I've heard in ages... a slightly quirky but utterly
unique combination of melodic 80s Spanish punk like Eskorbuto, tough
hardcore, oi!, and a little dash of new wave. I know that
"description" isn't very descriptive at all, but Pura Mania are a very
difficult band to pin down... the vocals and the drums are very
simple, straightforward, and tough, but on their best songs like
"Musica Para Genta Fea," the guitars and bass go off in a completely
different direction, recalling the dynamic interplay of post-punk /
new wave greats like Wire and Magazine. Basically, it's like Pura
Mania have made this band explicitly to appeal to my personal tastes,
simultaneously tickling the parts of my brain that crave tough
hardcore and oi!, simple and catchy melodies, and the interesting
instrumental dynamics of post-punk. It's crazy that Pura Mania are
this relentlessly good, but nothing about the packaging or
presentation really screams "this is some next-level shit." It's
doubtful that these guys will become the next big thing or that anyone
will think you're cooler for owning these records (except for me!),
but those in the know will insist that these are two of the best
records to be released in the year 2014. Utterly, utterly essential...
highest possible recommendation!

Desperfecto: Demo 2013 cassette	(CV)
Demo tape from this punk band out of Santiago, Chile. These (mostly)
ladies play raw, rudimentary, and catchy punk rock... I'm reminded
more than a little bit of Cocadictos, but Desperfecto are a little
more basic and not quite as explosive. If you dig raw,
straightforward, and catchy lady-fronted punk like Vice Squad or
Violators, or the amped-up sound of catchy Spanish punk like Vulpess
this is well worth checking out.

Makarra: Mierda de Hardkore cassette	(CV)
Killer demo from this band out of Lima, Peru. This is so weird, raw,
primitive, and awesome that I can't really get over it. I was
listening to it earlier today (for like the 5th time in a row... it's
that good) and my friend Sean was like, "is this a weird Wipers demo
or something?" which is something I never really would have thought of
because I'd imagine the band probably thinks of themselves more in the
lineage of bands like Sarcofago, Hellhammer, and Venom... i.e. tough,
raw metal bands, but it does have this strange hypnotic quality that
definitely recalls the Wipers. I'm also reminded a bit of GISM, though
without Randy Uchida's distinctive leads... instead, Makarra have more
of that strange haunting quality that GISM captured so well. I
probably don't have the expertise in the history of metal to describe
this accurately, but rest assured it is completely freaking awesome...
definitely recommended if you're into any of the aforementioned bands.

Ausmuteants: Fed Through a Tube 7" (Total Punk)
Latest single from this great Australian band, released just in time
for their recent US tour. If you haven't heard Ausmuteants yet, they
play completely infectious, high-energy new wave-infused punk. They
kind of remind me of the Spits in that they have that constant
16th-notes-on-the-hi-hats thing as well as some catchy synths, and
their songwriting is of the "Ramones on 45RPM" school. Really, what's
not to like? It's simple, catchy, maybe even slightly dumb punk rock,
and if that's your style (i.e. you buy releases on Total Punk Records)
you really need this one as well.

P.I.G.Z.: Bloody Belgium 7" (Ugly Pop)
Another month goes by and Ugly Pop reissues another shit-rare
first-gen punker... how does Simon do it? This time around it's the
sole single by Belgium's P.I.G.Z. from 1978. This is an energetic,
stomping and straightforward punk single that reminds me a lot of the
UK stuff that was starting in 1978 and 1979 as the second wave of punk
got underway. There's a slight rock and roll edge to the riffing that
almost makes this sound Australian, particularly on the standout
track, "Stooges." A few of these songs have been comped, but this
legit reissue is the only way you're going to hear all three, and as
with all of Ugly Pop's reissues you get a beautiful reproduction of
the original packaging and a bunch of extras as well, in this case a
12-page, 7"-inch-sized booklet that features an essay about the band
and record from Simon and a number of vintage press clippings.

X: X-Aspirations 12" (Ugly Pop)
Reissue of the killer first album by this first-gen Australian punk
band on the great Ugly Pop label. As we've come to expect from Ugly
Pop, all of the packaging, artwork, liner notes, and mastering are all
top-notch and definitely the next best thing to owning an original
copy. This LP has long been a personal favorite of mine... it's a very
weird record... undeniably punk, but also undeniably something else as
well. Even though they're from Australia, on this record I'm reminded
less of the amped-up, Stooges-influenced sound of bands like Radio
Birdman and the Saints and more of groups that kind of got lumped in
with punk but weren't really... bands like the Stranglers and Wire, as
well as first-gen post-punks like Gang of Four and the Pop Group.
While those references may make it seem as if X are more post- than
punk, X-Aspirations is an energetic, even explosive record... it's
just one with a ambition and dynamics that are beyond those of the
typical punk band. So yeah, basically, this is a great album and even
the 90s reissue is hard to come by these days, so there's no reason
not to add this excellent reissue to your collection.

X: X-Spurts: The 1977 Demos 12" (Ugly Pop)
First time on vinyl for this rare 1977 demo session by the Australian
band X (not to be confused, of course, with the band from Los Angeles
with the same name). Apparently this recording session was thought to
be completely lost, but was only recently recovered on an old,
battered cassette tape. I went into this thinking that it was probably
going to just be some demo recordings that the band made in advance of
their great debut record, X-Aspirations (also recently reissued by
Ugly Pop), but it turns out this is a completely different record that
captures a completely different era of the band (only one track,
"Revolution," appears on both X-Spurts and X-Aspirations). This
earlier version had a completely different lineup (I believe there was
only one member who played on both sessions), and has a lot more of
the muscular and melodic, Stooges-inspired propulsion that I associate
with early Australian punk than X-Aspirations, which is an incredible
album but much more dynamic, minimal, and with more of a post-punk
flair. X-Spurts, however, is balls-to-the-wall rock and roll, and if
you dig records like the Saints' Eternally Yours, Radio Birdman's two
LPs, or comparable British bands like Slaughter & the Dogs or the
Damned then you will want to hear this. It also contains a large,
12"x24" lyric insert with a bunch of photos and a ton of liner notes
providing contextual information about the album. Totally essential.

Various: Easier Said than Done cassette (self-released)
Brand new compilation of current Philadelphia hardcore and punk...
includes a track each from the Stasi (a total ripper!), New Crime,
Dark Thoughts, Blank Spell, Fuck SS, Batworm, Haldol, Low Charge,
Latex, Skin Graft, Stuck Pig, Holidays, Bad Energy, and Cool Life.
It's funny, for a city its size Philadelphia has never had a
particularly well-documented hardcore/punk scene, and Easier Said than
Done goes a long way toward remedying that. While there is some
diversity here, a majority of the bands play dark and straightforward
hardcore. I wouldn't say there's something so distinctive as a
"Philadelphia sound," but the bands all present top-notch material
(with some like the Stasi and Haldol really standing out) and if
you're interested in this kind of regional punk/hardcore compilation
you can't go wrong with this.

Asylum: S/T 7" (Vinyl Conflict)
Debut 7" from this Richmond, VA hardcore punk band. I've seen these
folks a couple of times and I like the fact that I can't really
pinpoint their sound... I guess at the end of the day this is just
bruising hardcore punk with a gnarly, aggressive woman on vocals. It
kind reminds me of meat-and-potatoes Bay Area groups like Look Back
and Laugh or Replica, but Asylum also have an element of
straightforward, GBH-type punk in their riffs that makes this a little
more of a catchy fist-pumper. God bless Vinyl Conflict for putting out
well-done, interesting regional hardcore punk like this.

Breakout: True Crime 7" (Grave Mistake)
2nd EP (the first one was self-released) from this Texas band. For
some reason I was thinking that a band called Breakout was going to
sound like NYHC or something, but this EP is really incredible, and
sounds nothing like that at all... there's definitely a hardcore
element (as you might expect from Grave Mistake), but there's a lot of
stranger stuff happening as well. There's a lot of interesting
interplay between the instruments that kind of reminds me of their
fellow Texans Institute, but much harder, denser, and more intense.
The label description actually mentions the Ruts (one of my favorite
bands), and I can totally hear that on the standout track, "All's
Quiet," which sounds kind of like a combination of the Ruts and
Zounds. It's really refreshing to hear a band incorporate those
influences without sounding like a total tribute band (which Institute
are occasionally guilty of), and at the end of the day I can't really
think of another band that Breakout sound like, and in my book there's
really no higher compliment for a hardcore punk record.

The #1s: S/T 12" (Deranged)
After what seems like quite a bit of delay, the vinyl for the #1s
debut 12" is out! I put out their previous single so it's no secret
that I absolutely adore this band, and I've been listening to this LP
quite a bit. I have to admit that when I first got it I was a little
disappointed that there wasn't more new material (it includes all
three tracks from the "Sharon" single that I put out as well as
several tracks from their previous EP and demo), but at the end of the
day it's nice to have it all in one place (particularly for those of
you who weren't lucky to grab the super hard to find first EP), and
even one new track by this band would make a record worth getting. Oh,
and if you haven't heard the #1s, they play upbeat, infectious
power-pop in the tradition of bands like Protex and the Exploding
Hearts, and for my money there is no one on the planet doing it better
at the moment.

Cardiac Arrest: In the Mouth of Madness 12" (Lumpy)
I don't think that many people expected a new Cardiac Arrest LP in
the year 2014, but here it is! It seems like not a lot of people knew
they were still active, but I guess they've been plugging away in St.
Louis chipping away at writing this full-length. As you might expect
from a band that's been around for a decade by now, this definitely
shows some development from their earlier stuff, but all in all the
formula hasn't really changed... it's still blistering,
balls-to-the-wall hardcore with Rob's trademark menacing yet catchy
vocal style. Their two EPs were total gut punches, but you can tell
that a lot of thought and work went into the LP as there's a lot of
attention to pacing and sequencing to make sure you keep flipping this
again and again. The production is also fantastic... straightforward
and dry but punchy as hell. Basically, if you're still interested in
this kind of early 80s-inspired USHC you're going to want to pick this
up, as it's incredibly well-executed and infectious.

Ausmuteants: Power Hour Value Pack cassette (Lumpy)
I could be wrong, but I think that this might be the first time Lumpy
has expanded his purview outside of his native great St. Louis area,
and boy does he go worldwide with a bang, collecting 32 unreleased and
demo tracks from Australia's Ausmuteants in time for their US tour.
While there's some pretty straightforward Ausmuteants stuff on here,
judging by the sound and instrumentation it sounds like a lot of these
tracks are home demos that were recorded by band members individually
as part of the songwriting process... I love this kind of thing as
comparing these to the ultimately released versions is an interesting
window into how they put these songs together. Regardless, if you're
an Ausmuteants fan you'll want this, and you can beat it at 32 tracks
for a few bucks...

Weed Hounds: S/T 12" (Katorga Works)
It's funny, I don't think I'd actually heard Weed Hounds' music
before, but I knew their name because they were kind of a running joke
in Katorga Works emails... I think Adam's been saying "Weed Hounds LP
will be out soon" for several years now. Not having any idea what
these guys actually sound like I was pleasantly surprised by some
great, kind of shoegaze-y indie-pop. It's definitely more toward the
Merchandise end of the Katorga Works catalog, but the band that Weed
Hounds really remind me of is Siamese Twins... just like the Twins,
their music seems to come to the listener through a kind of dense,
hazy filter. For a lot of bands that sheen of noise is the beginning
and end of their sound, but Weed Hounds have more than enough melody
and songwriting skill that bubbles up to the surface and keeps things
interesting. Just like their punk stuff, when Katorga Works puts out a
more indie-ish release like this you know it's going to be top-notch.
Definitely recommended if you like the aforementioned bands.

Nerv: Off Earth Now 7" (Lagerville)
Brand new 7" from this band out of Iowa. Their previous 7" was a
store favorite... a totally unique blast of pure Midwestern hardcore a
la Die Kreuzen or Mecht Mensch. While that's still the foundation
here, things are a little bit different this time around. First of
all, the production is a lot more dense, compressed, and
disorienting... it's one of those recordings that sounds like the
music is being beamed directly into your brain stem rather than like
you're listening to an actual band, and while that may sound like a
bad thing it actually fits this band's style of quirky hardcore quite
well. Fans of Nasa Space Universe take note as this band are on a
similar trip, though it's a little bit less "out there" and a little
more in line with the classic USHC sound.

Generacion Suicida: Todo Terminida 12" (Going Underground)
Brand new 12" EP from this LA-area band. When Generacion Suicida
started it was clear that they had a major fascination with the
X-on-downers sound of Masshysteri and their earlier stuff felt (to me
at least) like a scrappier, more DIY take on that sound. While that's
still a big element of their sound here, things have evolved a bit,
and for the better. First of all (and I don't have any of their other
records handy to check), but I don't remember this band having such a
sick bass player... whoever is playing bass is just all over the
place, laying down this constant, fluid stream of 16th-notes that pull
the songs in these great, Eskorbuto-esque melodic directions while the
guitars and vocals chug along at a more straightforward punk pace. The
slight disjunction between these elements of the band's sound really
drives things forward and keeps it very interesting throughout, and of
course since the core of their sound is very melodic the whole thing
is very catchy and memorable. While I know this band gets kind of
pegged as a Masshysteri-influenced band, the songs on this record are
almost exclusively blistering fast and melodic, almost sounding in
places like a kind of melancholic take on pogo punk. It's a weird
combination, but totally unique and killer.

Sick Thoughts: Coming Over 7" (Going Underground)
Latest 7" from this one-man project out of Baltimore. I think I've
carried just about all of Drew's records up to this point and they've
definitely gotten a lot better... I remember getting a very angry
email from him a few months ago complaining that my descriptions of
his records painted him as nothing more than a Reatards ripoff. I
think the evidence kind of speaks for itself on those early records
(not that they're not great, they're just heavily indebted to the
Reatards), but he's definitely be onto some different shit lately.
This new stuff has much more of a KBD feel with a seriously warped
guitar sound and a much more riff-oriented, song-y approach that's way
more memorable than anything he's done. Everything is catchier,
wilder, and ultimately more memorable... I'd stack these three rippers
up against any neo-KBD band and it would blow 99% of it away... I
can't think of another group doing a more authentically raw and wild
take on the KBD sound, so if you're a fan of those old comps or of
raw, wild garage rock like Teengenerate this is one you'll definitely
need to add to your pile.

Urbanoia: Psykisk Terror 7" (Solar Funeral)
2nd EP from this raging Norweigan hardcore band on the great Solar
Funeral label. You can always count on SF to put out above-the-bar
hardcore (and they're even releasing the next Skem=C3=A4ta 7"!), and this
EP is no different. This 4-song EP is very short (about 4 minutes in
total), but you shouldn't hold the band's economy against them... this
is straightforward, pounding, and well-produced hardcore in the
tradition of Norweigan bands like Svart Framtid, Headcleaners, and
Akutt Innleggelse... no guitar solos, no fake "raw punk" vibe, just
straight up hardcore. If that's your style then this one is pretty
much essential.

Fashionable Activism #3 zine
Third issue if this punk fanzine, and it's pretty much a complete
reboot in terms of both aesthetics and content. The editor moved from
Minneapolis to Austin, TX and completed a design degree, and according
to the preface he's decided to be much more deliberate about the
zine's aesthetic, working hard to avoid common and cliche visual
tropes, and the content of the zine is also more focused on design
rather than just music. This time around you get interviews with Laura
Pallmall of Blotter, the artist Elijah Funk, and the St. Louis band
Black Panties. I really hope that Kevin continues on this path as it
seems like a really good direction, and it's rare these days to see a
real "punk" fanzine that actually wants to be more than just another
punk fanzine.

Hi everyone, just hitting you with a quick mid-month update. Unfortunately =
no new releases on Sorry State at the moment, though I'm hopeful that =
we'll have the Louder LP up for sale by the end of October. In addition to =
that, new releases from Davidians, Dark Ages, Gay Kiss, Oblivionation, and =
Skemata are coming along, and we just got test presses for new records by =
Broken Prayer and No Love that sound great. More on those in a couple of =
weeks, though.<br><br>
For now, this is mostly to let you know all of the great records that have =
come through the distro so far this month. Unfortunately a few really hot =
items have already come and gone, including two new releases from =
Ausmuteants, the new Buck Biloxi 12", and this awesome zine and cassette =
pack devoted to the almighty Screamers. We'll be restocking all three =
eventually, but in the meantime check out all of the other great stuff =
that's still here!<br><br>

Dia Final: demo cassette (self-released)<br>
Demo cassette from this new band featuring a bunch of veterans of the Los =
Angeles punk scene. This is an absolutely explosive demo cassette... the =
music is built around pretty simple 1-2 drumming and strong and simple =
punk riffs, but something about the performance here just jumps out of the =
speakers. It definitely bears a little bit of resemblance to the whole =
Ruleta Rusa / Peligro Social style, but the production is much more raw, =
the vocals have more of a kind of snotty, '77 flavor that recalls bands =
like the Stitches, and the music is much more straightforward and =
stripped-down. Dia Final definitely aren't reinventing the wheel, but with =
this style either you sound explosive or you don't, and this one will =
knock you on your ass.<br><br>

Institute: <i>Salt</i> 12" (Sacred Bones)<br>
Brand new 12" from this Austin, TX punk band, and as you can expect =
there's a slight uptick in production quality now that they've moved to =
Sacred Bones. However, this doesn't mean so much that the production is =
"better," but rather than that it's even more spot-on in terms of =
replicating the sound of Institute's clear influences. Seriously, there =
are moments on this record where I have to honestly ask myself, "did I put =
on the Zounds LP by mistake?" The lead guitar tone is literally almost an =
exact match. I'm sure that some people will dismiss them as a soundalike =
band, but
I really like Institute, and I think this is easily their strongest =
material yet... the clearer production really serves them well, and the =
lead guitar lines in particular here are just absolutely infectious. It =
seems like lots of bands lay claim to a Crisis / Zounds influence, but =
it's really striking how much Institute sound like those bands, and =
honestly the music is of just as high quality. I've been playing this over =
and over since we got it in and I don't think it's going to leave the =
turntable any time soon.<br><br>

Pura Mania: <i>Musica Para Genta Fea</i> 7" (CV)<br>
Pura Mania: <i>La Estafa Musical</i> 7" (CV)<br>
So, even though these are two separate releases, I'm going to write one =
description to cover both... these appear to have been recorded at the =
same session, and the concurrent release time and similar artwork seem to =
imply that they are meant to be considered together. Now that I have that =
out of the way I can say GET BOTH OF THESE RECORDS RIGHT NOW!!!! =
Seriously, I can't remember the last time I've fallen this head over heels =
for a band. Pura Mania have one of the most original, exciting sounds I've =
heard in ages... a slightly quirky but utterly unique combination of =
melodic 80s Spanish punk like Eskorbuto, tough hardcore, oi!, and a little =
dash of new wave. I know that "description" isn't very descriptive at all, =
but Pura Mania are a very difficult band to pin down... the vocals and the =
drums are very simple, straightforward, and tough, but on their best songs =
like "Musica Para Genta Fea," the guitars and bass go off in a completely =
different direction, recalling the dynamic interplay of post-punk / new =
wave greats like Wire and Magazine. Basically, it's like Pura Mania have =
made this band explicitly to appeal to my personal tastes, simultaneously =
tickling the parts of my brain that crave tough hardcore and oi!, simple =
and catchy melodies, and the interesting instrumental dynamics of =
post-punk. It's crazy that Pura Mania are this relentlessly good, but =
nothing about the packaging or presentation really screams "this is some =
next-level shit." It's doubtful that these guys will become the next big =
thing or that anyone will think you're cooler for owning these records =
(except for me!), but those in the know will insist that these are two of =
the best records to be released in the year 2014. Utterly, utterly =
essential... highest possible recommendation!<br><br>

Desperfecto: Demo 2013 cassette	(CV)<br>
Demo tape from this punk band out of Santiago, Chile. These (mostly) =
ladies play raw, rudimentary, and catchy punk rock... I'm reminded more =
than a little bit of Cocadictos, but Desperfecto are a little more basic =
and not quite as explosive. If you dig raw, straightforward, and catchy =
lady-fronted punk like Vice Squad or Violators, or the amped-up sound of =
catchy Spanish punk like Vulpess this is well worth checking out.<br><br>

Makarra: <i>Mierda de Hardkore</i> cassette	(CV)<br>
Killer demo from this band out of Lima, Peru. This is so weird, raw, =
primitive, and awesome that I can't really get over it. I was listening to =
it earlier today (for like the 5th time in a row... it's that good) and my =
friend Sean was like, "is this a weird Wipers demo or something?" which is =
something I never really would have thought of because I'd imagine the =
band probably thinks of themselves more in the lineage of bands like =
Sarcofago, Hellhammer, and Venom... i.e. tough, raw metal bands, but it =
does have this strange hypnotic quality that definitely recalls the =
Wipers. I'm also reminded a bit of GISM, though without Randy Uchida's =
distinctive leads... instead, Makarra have more of that strange haunting =
quality that GISM captured so well. I probably don't have the expertise in =
the history of metal to describe this accurately, but rest assured it is =
completely freaking awesome... definitely recommended if you're into any =
of the aforementioned bands.<br><br>

Ausmuteants: <i>Fed Through a Tube</i> 7" (Total Punk)<br>
Latest single from this great Australian band, released just in time for =
their recent US tour. If you haven't heard Ausmuteants yet, they play =
completely infectious, high-energy new wave-infused punk. They kind of =
remind me of the Spits in that they have that constant =
16th-notes-on-the-hi-hats thing as well as some catchy synths, and their =
songwriting is of the "Ramones on 45RPM" school. Really, what's not to =
like? It's simple, catchy, maybe even slightly dumb punk rock, and if =
that's your style (i.e. you buy releases on Total Punk Records) you really =
need this one as well.<br><br>

P.I.G.Z.: <i>Bloody Belgium</i> 7" (Ugly Pop)<br>
Another month goes by and Ugly Pop reissues another shit-rare first-gen =
punker... how does Simon do it? This time around it's the sole single by =
Belgium's P.I.G.Z. from 1978. This is an energetic, stomping and =
straightforward punk single that reminds me a lot of the UK stuff that was =
starting in 1978 and 1979 as the second wave of punk got underway. There's =
a slight rock and roll edge to the riffing that almost makes this sound =
Australian, particularly on the standout track, "Stooges." A few of these =
songs have been comped, but this legit reissue is the only way you're =
going to hear all three, and as with all of Ugly Pop's reissues you get a =
beautiful reproduction of the original packaging and a bunch of extras as =
well, in this case a 12-page, 7"-inch-sized booklet that features an essay =
about the band and record from Simon and a number of vintage press =
clippings.<br><br>

X: <i>X-Aspirations</i> 12" (Ugly Pop)<br>
Reissue of the killer first album by this first-gen Australian punk band =
on the great Ugly Pop label. As we've come to expect from Ugly Pop, all of =
the packaging, artwork, liner notes, and mastering are all top-notch and =
definitely the next best thing to owning an original copy. This LP has =
long been a personal favorite of mine... it's a very weird record... =
undeniably punk, but also undeniably something else as well. Even though =
they're from Australia, on this record I'm reminded less of the amped-up, =
Stooges-influenced sound of bands like Radio Birdman and the Saints and =
more of groups that kind of got lumped in with punk but weren't really... =
bands like the Stranglers and Wire, as well as first-gen post-punks like =
Gang of Four and the Pop Group. While those references may make it seem as =
if X are more post- than punk, <i>X-Aspirations</i> is an energetic, even =
explosive record... it's just one with a ambition and dynamics that are =
beyond those of the typical punk band. So yeah, basically, this is a great =
album and even the 90s reissue is hard to come by these days, so there's =
no reason not to add this excellent reissue to your collection.<br><br>

X: <i>X-Spurts: The 1977 Demos</i> 12" (Ugly Pop)<br>
First time on vinyl for this rare 1977 demo session by the Australian band =
X (not to be confused, of course, with the band from Los Angeles with the =
same name). Apparently this recording session was thought to be completely =
lost, but was only recently recovered on an old, battered cassette tape. I =
went into this thinking that it was probably going to just be some demo =
recordings that the band made in advance of their great debut record, =
<i>X-Aspirations</i> (also recently reissued by Ugly Pop), but it turns =
out this is a completely different record that captures a completely =
different era of the band (only one track, "Revolution," appears on both =
<i>X-Spurts</i> and <i>X-Aspirations</i>). This earlier version had a =
completely different lineup (I believe there was only one member who =
played on both sessions), and has a lot more of the muscular and melodic, =
Stooges-inspired propulsion that I associate with early Australian punk =
than <i>X-Aspirations</i>, which is an incredible album but much more =
dynamic, minimal, and with more of a post-punk flair. <i>X-Spurts</i>, =
however, is balls-to-the-wall rock and roll, and if you dig records like =
the Saints' <i>Eternally Yours</i>, Radio Birdman's two LPs, or comparable =
British bands like Slaughter & the Dogs or the Damned then you will want =
to hear this. It also contains a large, 12"x24" lyric insert with a bunch =
of photos and a ton of liner notes providing contextual information about =
the album. Totally essential.<br><br>

Various: <i>Easier Said than Done</i> cassette (self-released)<br>
Brand new compilation of current Philadelphia hardcore and punk... =
includes a track each from the Stasi (a total ripper!), New Crime, Dark =
Thoughts, Blank Spell, Fuck SS, Batworm, Haldol, Low Charge, Latex, Skin =
Graft, Stuck Pig, Holidays, Bad Energy, and Cool Life. It's funny, for a =
city its size Philadelphia has never had a particularly well-documented =
hardcore/punk scene, and <i>Easier Said than Done</i> goes a long way =
toward remedying that. While there is some diversity here, a majority of =
the bands play dark and straightforward hardcore. I wouldn't say there's =
something so distinctive as a "Philadelphia sound," but the bands all =
present top-notch material (with some like the Stasi and Haldol really =
standing out) and if you're interested in this kind of regional =
punk/hardcore compilation you can't go wrong with this.<br><br>

Asylum: S/T 7" (Vinyl Conflict)<br>
Debut 7" from this Richmond, VA hardcore punk band. I've seen these folks =
a couple of times and I like the fact that I can't really pinpoint their =
sound... I guess at the end of the day this is just bruising hardcore punk =
with a gnarly, aggressive woman on vocals. It kind reminds me of =
meat-and-potatoes Bay Area groups like Look Back and Laugh or Replica, but =
Asylum also have an element of straightforward, GBH-type punk in their =
riffs that makes this a little more of a catchy fist-pumper. God bless =
Vinyl Conflict for putting out well-done, interesting regional hardcore =
punk like this.<br><br>

Breakout: <i>True Crime</i> 7" (Grave Mistake)<br>
2nd EP (the first one was self-released) from this Texas band. For some =
reason I was thinking that a band called Breakout was going to sound like =
NYHC or something, but this EP is really incredible, and sounds nothing =
like that at all... there's definitely a hardcore element (as you might =
expect from Grave Mistake), but there's a lot of stranger stuff happening =
as well. There's a lot of interesting interplay between the instruments =
that kind of reminds me of their fellow Texans Institute, but much harder, =
denser, and more intense. The label description actually mentions the Ruts =
(one of my favorite bands), and I can totally hear that on the standout =
track, "All's Quiet," which sounds kind of like a combination of the Ruts =
and Zounds. It's really refreshing to hear a band incorporate those =
influences without sounding like a total tribute band (which Institute are =
occasionally guilty of), and at the end of the day I can't really think of =
another band that Breakout sound like, and in my book there's really no =
higher compliment for a hardcore punk record.<br><br>

The #1s: S/T 12" (Deranged)<br>
After what seems like quite a bit of delay, the vinyl for the #1s debut =
12" is out! I put out their previous single so it's no secret that I =
absolutely adore this band, and I've been listening to this LP quite a =
bit. I have to admit that when I first got it I was a little disappointed =
that there wasn't more new material (it includes all three tracks from the =
"Sharon" single that I put out as well as several tracks from their =
previous EP and demo), but at the end of the day it's nice to have it all =
in one place (particularly for those of you who weren't lucky to grab the =
super hard to find first EP), and even one new track by this band would =
make a record worth getting. Oh, and if you haven't heard the #1s, they =
play upbeat, infectious power-pop in the tradition of bands like Protex =
and the Exploding Hearts, and for my money there is no one on the planet =
doing it better at the moment.<br><br>

Cardiac Arrest: <i>In the Mouth of Madness</i> 12" (Lumpy)<br>
I don't think that many people expected a new Cardiac Arrest LP in the =
year 2014, but here it is! It seems like not a lot of people knew they =
were still active, but I guess they've been plugging away in St. Louis =
chipping away at writing this full-length. As you might expect from a band =
that's been around for a decade by now, this definitely shows some =
development from their earlier stuff, but all in all the formula hasn't =
really changed... it's still blistering, balls-to-the-wall hardcore with =
Rob's trademark menacing yet catchy vocal style. Their two EPs were total =
gut punches, but you can tell that a lot of thought and work went into the =
LP as there's a lot of attention to pacing and sequencing to make sure you =
keep flipping this again and again. The production is also fantastic... =
straightforward and dry but punchy as hell. Basically, if you're still =
interested in this kind of early 80s-inspired USHC you're going to want to =
pick this up, as it's incredibly well-executed and infectious.<br><br>

Ausmuteants: <i>Power Hour Value Pack</i> cassette (Lumpy)<br>
I could be wrong, but I think that this might be the first time Lumpy has =
expanded his purview outside of his native great St. Louis area, and boy =
does he go worldwide with a bang, collecting 32 unreleased and demo tracks =
from Australia's Ausmuteants in time for their US tour. While there's some =
pretty straightforward Ausmuteants stuff on here, judging by the sound and =
instrumentation it sounds like a lot of these tracks are home demos that =
were recorded by band members individually as part of the songwriting =
process... I love this kind of thing as comparing these to the ultimately =
released versions is an interesting window into how they put these songs =
together. Regardless, if you're an Ausmuteants fan you'll want this, and =
you can beat it at 32 tracks for a few bucks...<br><br>

Weed Hounds: S/T 12" (Katorga Works)<br>
It's funny, I don't think I'd actually heard Weed Hounds' music before, =
but I knew their name because they were kind of a running joke in Katorga =
Works emails... I think Adam's been saying "Weed Hounds LP will be out =
soon" for several years now. Not having any idea what these guys actually =
sound like I was pleasantly surprised by some great, kind of shoegaze-y =
indie-pop. It's definitely more toward the Merchandise end of the Katorga =
Works catalog, but the band that Weed Hounds really remind me of is =
Siamese Twins... just like the Twins, their music seems to come to the =
listener through a kind of dense, hazy filter. For a lot of bands that =
sheen of noise is the beginning and end of their sound, but Weed Hounds =
have more than enough melody and songwriting skill that bubbles up to the =
surface and keeps things interesting. Just like their punk stuff, when =
Katorga Works puts out a more indie-ish release like this you know it's =
going to be top-notch. Definitely recommended if you like the =
aforementioned bands.<br><br>

Nerv: <i>Off Earth Now</i> 7" (Lagerville)<br>
Brand new 7" from this band out of Iowa. Their previous 7" was a store =
favorite... a totally unique blast of pure Midwestern hardcore a la Die =
Kreuzen or Mecht Mensch. While that's still the foundation here, things =
are a little bit different this time around. First of all, the production =
is a lot more dense, compressed, and disorienting... it's one of those =
recordings that sounds like the music is being beamed directly into your =
brain stem rather than like you're listening to an actual band, and while =
that may sound like a bad thing it actually fits this band's style of =
quirky hardcore quite well. Fans of Nasa Space Universe take note as this =
band are on a similar trip, though it's a little bit less "out there" and =
a little more in line with the classic USHC sound.<br><br>

Generacion Suicida: <i>Todo Terminida</i> 12" (Going Underground)<br>
Brand new 12" EP from this LA-area band. When Generacion Suicida started =
it was clear that they had a major fascination with the X-on-downers sound =
of Masshysteri and their earlier stuff felt (to me at least) like a =
scrappier, more DIY take on that sound. While that's still a big element =
of their sound here, things have evolved a bit, and for the better. First =
of all (and I don't have any of their other records handy to check), but I =
don't remember this band having such a sick bass player... whoever is =
playing bass is just all over the place, laying down this constant, fluid =
stream of 16th-notes that pull the songs in these great, Eskorbuto-esque =
melodic directions while the guitars and vocals chug along at a more =
straightforward punk pace. The slight disjunction between these elements =
of the band's sound really drives things forward and keeps it very =
interesting throughout, and of course since the core of their sound is =
very melodic the whole thing is very catchy and memorable. While I know =
this band gets kind of pegged as a Masshysteri-influenced band, the songs =
on this record are almost exclusively blistering fast and melodic, almost =
sounding in places like a kind of melancholic take on pogo punk. It's a =
weird combination, but totally unique and killer.<br><br>

Sick Thoughts: <i>Coming Over</i> 7" (Going Underground)<br>
Latest 7" from this one-man project out of Baltimore. I think I've carried =
just about all of Drew's records up to this point and they've definitely =
gotten a lot better... I remember getting a very angry email from him a =
few months ago complaining that my descriptions of his records painted him =
as nothing more than a Reatards ripoff. I think the evidence kind of =
speaks for itself on those early records (not that they're not great, =
they're just heavily indebted to the Reatards), but he's definitely be =
onto some different shit lately. This new stuff has much more of a KBD =
feel with a seriously warped guitar sound and a much more riff-oriented, =
song-y approach that's way more memorable than anything he's done. =
Everything is catchier, wilder, and ultimately more memorable... I'd stack =
these three rippers up against any neo-KBD band and it would blow 99% of =
it away... I can't think of another group doing a more authentically raw =
and wild take on the KBD sound, so if you're a fan of those old comps or =
of raw, wild garage rock like Teengenerate this is one you'll definitely =
need to add to your pile.<br><br>

Urbanoia: <i>Psykisk Terror</i> 7" (Solar Funeral)<br>
2nd EP from this raging Norweigan hardcore band on the great Solar Funeral =
label. You can always count on SF to put out above-the-bar hardcore (and =
they're even releasing the next Skem&auml;ta 7"!), and this EP is no =
different. This 4-song EP is very short (about 4 minutes in total), but =
you shouldn't hold the band's economy against them... this is =
straightforward, pounding, and well-produced hardcore in the tradition of =
Norweigan bands like Svart Framtid, Headcleaners, and Akutt Innleggelse... =
no guitar solos, no fake "raw punk" vibe, just straight up hardcore. If =
that's your style then this one is pretty much essential.<br><br>

Fashionable Activism #3 zine<br>
Third issue if this punk fanzine, and it's pretty much a complete reboot =
in terms of both aesthetics and content. The editor moved from Minneapolis =
to Austin, TX and completed a design degree, and according to the preface =
he's decided to be much more deliberate about the zine's aesthetic, =
working hard to avoid common and cliche visual tropes, and the content of =
the zine is also more focused on design rather than just music. This time =
around you get interviews with Laura Pallmall of Blotter, the artist =
Elijah Funk, and the St. Louis band Black Panties. I really hope that =
Kevin continues on this path as it seems like a really good direction, and =
it's rare these days to see a real "punk" fanzine that actually wants to =
be more than just another punk fanzine.<br><br>
