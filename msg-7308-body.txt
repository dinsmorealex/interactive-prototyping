REGISTERED STUDENTS (INCLUDING STUDY ABROAD AND MAINTENANCE OF STATUS STUDENTS) – THE STUDENT HEALTH INSURANCE WAIVER DEADLINE IS SEPTEMBER 22, 2014.

If your intention is to remain enrolled in the student health insurance plan, no action is necessary.  All eligible students are automatically enrolled. If a parent or other third party is responsible for the payment of your tuition and fees, please be sure to forward this email to such parent or other third party.

Dear New School Student:

The New School, in conjunction with Aetna Student Health, offers a Student Health Insurance Plan for the 2014-2015 academic year. The annual premium is $2,892 with $1,173 charged in the fall and $1,719 charged in the spring. The Student Health Services Fee charged by The New School is $318, per semester. The New School Health Fees are automatically added to your MyNewSchool student account at registration.

Who is eligible and automatically charged?

All degree, diploma, online only, visiting, mobility (study abroad), maintenance of status, Lang and Parsons consortium, graduate certificate program, ESL and Design, ESL and Music and graduate and undergraduate degree program non-matriculating students are automatically charged the Student Health Insurance premium and the New School’s Student Health Services Fee.

Depending on course load and status (including maintenance of status), you may be eligible to decline these services by completing an Online Waiver Form by September 22, 2014, fall waiver deadline for the 2014-2015 academic year. A waiver is required each school year in the fall, or in the spring if the student is not registered in the fall semester. Please note that a new waiver will need to be submitted for the 2015-2016 academic year.

How do I submit an online waiver form?

Should you wish to waive participation in the Student Health Insurance Plan/Student Health Services you must complete the online waiver form. To access Plan information and the Online Waiver Form, please visit http://www.universityhealthplans.com/contact/mail/link/333886/2/ and select the "New School" link. Click on the "Brochure" link to view the Plan Brochure or the "Waiver Form" link to access the online waiver.

Please note that if you choose to waive The Student Health Insurance Plan, you cannot choose to re-enroll in the Plan after the waiver deadline at any point for the remainder of the academic year without documentation supporting the recent loss (30 days) of your current non-student health insurance policy.

If you have been covered by a parent or spouse's policy, please review it carefully to make certain you are still eligible for coverage. Employer plans often do not cover students after they reach a certain age, and HMOs may provide limited coverage when away from home or traveling abroad. Please take a moment to compare your coverage with the Student Health Insurance Plan to ensure that you are adequately covered.

Health Fees not waived by September 22, 2014, will remain on your student account and you will be responsible for paying these fees.

For questions regarding the online waiver process, please contact University Health Plans at (800) 437-6448.

The New School Student Health Insurance Plan (the "Plan") is underwritten by Aetna Life Insurance Company (ALIC). The Plan is administered by Chickering Claims Administrators, Inc. Aetna Student Health is the brand name for products and services provided by these companies.

IF YOU GRADUATED IN MAY, HAVE ALREADY SUCCESSFULLY SUBMITTED AN ONLINE WAIVER FOR THE 2014-2015 ACADEMIC YEAR, OR IF YOU DO NOT PLAN TO ATTEND THE NEW SCHOOL FOR THE FALL 2014 TERM, KINDLY IGNORE THIS NOTE. THANK YOU.
