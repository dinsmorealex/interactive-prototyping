Label News

Hi everyone! The big news this month is that the long-awaited new
Libyans LP, Expired Language, is out now:

As you can see, we have some limited copies on smoke-colored vinyl,
which perfectly matches the gorgeous artwork from Aaron Demuth. These
are going fast, so don't sleep if you want the limited version!
Musically, this album picks up where the more melodic songs on A
Common Place left off, with huge chorus hooks, intricate guitars, and
fast and tight hardcore drumming. I'm so stoked about this LP, and if
you give it a listen on the BandCamp site (
http://sorrystaterecords.bandcamp.com/album/expired-language ) I'm
sure you will be as well. Word on the street is that the Libyans are
even planning an east coast / midwest tour for early next year, so get
stoked for that too!

This past weekend we had a big Black Friday sale in the shop and
online... those of you who check the web site regularly or follow us
on social media heard about that, but I didn't manage to get the email
update on time, so I've decided to extend part of the sale for another
week. There are still deep discounts on many Sorry State titles (
http://www.sorrystaterecords.com/collections/sorry-state-releases?page=3D1
), and all orders over $100 get 15% off by entering the coupon code
blackfriday at checkout. Hopefully that nudge will get those of you
who have been thinking about placing a big order for a while to take
the plunge. The sale runs until Sunday, so get your orders in before
then!

The only other label news at the moment is that the vinyl has now been
pressed for the new Brain F=E2=89=A0 LP, but we're running into some =
issues
finalizing the artwork (which seems to be a pattern when Alex from
Grave Mistake is involved... he's a perfectionist!). Hopefully we're
still on track to get that out sometime this month, but it's probably
looking more like early January at this point. After that, the label
will probably be quiet for a little while as I continue to get the
store off the ground.

Speaking of which, Sorry State's downtown Raleigh retail store is
going great! We're still chock-full of great used records, all of the
stuff on the web site, and a bunch more stuff like turntables and
merch as well. Drop by and say hello if you're ever in town!

Jeff's Update

Hey everyone!

It's been an awesome first month working at the Sorry State store.
Even though my approach to listening to records in the store should be
trying to listen to as many of the new records as possible, there are
a few records that I find myself listening to on repeat constantly:

The new Radioactivity LP is pretty addictive.  While the post-Marked
Men band does sound almost exactly like the their previous band, I
think this LP might be better than at least one or two of the Marked
Men records.  As far as heavier and hardcore stuff, I've been really
digging the new Green Beret 7" and  Churchwhip's final EP.  Also, for
all of you devotees to the Sorry State label that have not yet checked
out the new Libyans LP, you NEED to jump on that.  SO good.

Alright time for my little plug here:  Like I mentioned last month, my
band Mercy Killings is playing a few shows in the Northeast this
coming week.  All of the shows are stacked with killer bands, so
definitely come check us out!!

Here's a list of the shows:

12/5/2013 - Philly at the Golden Tea House with Low Charge, Paranoias,
and Cool Life

12/6/2013 - Boston at the Cambridge Elk Lodge with Boston Strangler,
Waste Management, MFP, and Savageheads

12/7/2013 - New York at the Acheron with Peacebreakers and Missionary

You'll all probably be hearing from me again around this time January.
Thanks for reading!
-Jeff

Seth's Update

Hey everyone.  It's a month later and I still can't take the Love
Triangle LP off my turntable.  If you have not gotten it yet then stop
reading and order one.  Also the Radioactivity LP has been getting a
lot of play.  Aside from listening to those two LPs I've been digging
the new Steve Ignorant LP,  which is like a weird bizarro Crass with
high end production.  A few more suggestions would be the Lip Cream
Lonely Rock reissue and the Lost Kids reissue, two incredibly solid
7"s that I was excited to see come out, the new Libyans LP and the
live Repos LP.

Daniel's Update

I have to pretty much reiterate Jeff and Seth's recommendations
here... the Love Triangle and Radioactivity LPs are still burning up
my turntable as well, and I've revisited that Repos record quite a bit
this month too. Also, I can't believe neither Jeff or Seth mentioned
the excellent Abused reissue (which is out of stock at the moment, but
we have more on the way) or the new Out Cold LP! Both of those are
stone-cold bangers. I've also nearly worn the grooves out on the
Merchandise BBC Sessions 12", but it looks like that is now out of
stock as well.

Oh, and since we're plugging bands, I might as well note that me and
Seth's band No Love has a facebook page (
https://www.facebook.com/noloveraleigh ). Things are a little quiet
now, but we're playing a show this Saturday at In the Groove Records
in Raleigh and we'll be gearing up for another recording in January or
February. Like us on there to keep tabs.

Also, as you look through this update please note that it's only a
small portion of what was added to the site this month... now that
I've opened the store it's gotten increasingly tough to write
descriptions of everything and keep it all catalogued here, so
consider this a curated list of the most noteworthy titles that were
added this month. Of course everything is listed on the web site, and
there are probably 100+ records added this month that aren't on this
list.

Oh, and in case you're wondering, here are our top 10 sellers for
November:

* Joint D=E2=89=A0: Satan Is Real Again, Again 12" (Sorry State)
* Libyans: Expired Language 12" (Sorry State)
* The Love Triangle: Clever, Clever 12" (Sorry State)
* Various: Harsh & Hard cassette
* The #1s: Sharon 7" (Sorry State)
* Church Whip: Final 7" (Vinyl Rites)
* Merchandise: BBC Sessions 12" (Fan Club)
* Green Beret: The Cult of State 7" (Side Two)
* Slag: S/T 7" (Hesitation Wound)
* Anasazi: Sex with ET 7" (Lexi Flexi)

Featured Distro Items

Blotter: demo cassette (self-released)
Demo tape from this new Texas band featuring members of Wiccans,
Glue, and Creamers. Of those three, I'd say Creamers is the closest
point of comparison, though this is way more hardcore. Just brutal,
stomping stuff with perfect, early 80s-sounding 4-track production.
This sounds like something that could have come from the early Touch
and Go catalog, maybe with a touch of Infest in some of the vocal
patterns and the weird changes. Definitely one of the best straight up
hardcore demos I've heard in ages... highly recommended.

White Line Fever: S/T 7" (Nothing Is Real)
Debut 7" from this Boston band. This is a ripper... the foundation is
straight up early 80s HC like the Necros or something like that, but
there's a bit of a rocking lead guitar thing going on as well. In
sounds like a way angrier, way more raw Annihilation Time rocking out
on some GBH covers... totally sick. Great-looking screen printed
covers on this bad boy too!

Last Words: S/T 12" (To Live a Lie)
Finally, the debut LP from Raleigh's Last Words is out! Clearly
inspired by the X-Claim! catalog as well as the newer crop of Boston
bands, this is some hard-charging stuff, alternating blistering fast
parts with crushing breakdowns and topped with some absolutely feral
vocals. Ex-Stripmines, Devour, Abuse., etc.

Morbid Angel: Covenant 12" (Earache)
Reissue of Morbid Angel's classic 3rd album. On this record they made
the switch to a semi-major label, but really didn't compromise their
sound at all. This is still pure death metal... just about all
residual elements of thrash are gone, leaving a grinding, hulking
behemoth of a sound. Like all of Earache's recent reissues, this is
remastered from the original tapes with special care to convey all of
the subtleties of the original release. Includes a gorgeous full-color
gatefold jacket as well.

Out Cold: A Heated Display 12" (Painkiller)
Throughout their long and storied career, Out Cold have never
attempted to be anything other than Out Cold... they just put out
full-length after full-length of blazing, uncompromising hardcore in
the Negative Approach tradition. They never changed genres, got weird,
or tried to expand their horizons... they just stayed angry, and
that's the reason they're worshipped. Sadly, the band is no more, but
thankfully they recorded a wealth of material before their untimely
demise, and this LP constitutes a significant chunk of it. After the
death of Mark Sheehan (who plays guitar on these recordings), the band
re-enlisted their original vocalist for these recordings they honestly
haven't lost a step... if anything, his vocals are even more
Brannon-inspired, and this is as perfect as any other Out Cold record.
Essential.

Abused: Loud and Clear 12" (Radio Raheem)
INCREDIBLE reissue of this NYHC classic. You already know the music
because you downloaded it years ago, but this contains the classic
Loud and Clear 7", the demo, and a handful of extremely well-recorded
live tracks. The real gem here, though, is the packaging. Not only is
it a big gatefold that reproduces the original artwork, it comes with
a completely STUNNING 12"x12" full-color booklet with a band history,
tons of reproductions of interviews, photos, and of course huge
reproductions of those incredible flyers. An absolutely incredible
package... well worth every dime, and I guarantee if you love early
80s HC you won't be disappointed.

Liverpool Echo: S/T 12" (Sing Sing)
Another case of Sing Sing digging back a little further than the 70s
punk stuff they're known primarily for, and this one is a gem.
Liverpool Echo's 1973 LP is a slice of unabashed Beatles worship...
and honestly I've rarely heard better. Clearly the band are in love
with the older Merseybeat sound rather than the band's later
psychedelic and rockin' stuff, and they pay a deft homage with these
simple, powerful songs. The vocalist also sounds uncannily like Paul
McCartney, which doesn't hurt when you're trying to do something like
this. A real front-to-back banger that anyone into awesome,
high-energy rock and roll should be able to get down with.

The High and the Mighty: Crunch on Demo 1984 7" (Radio Raheem)
Radio Raheem reissued this guy at the same time as the long-awaited
Abused 12", and this reissue is definitely up to that standard. I
hadn't actually heard of the High and Mighty before, but this is
straight up early 80s NYHC... apparently members went on to Antidote,
but really it sounds a lot more like the Abused, and you can't beat
that authentic early 80s production. Like the Abused reissue, this one
also comes with a gorgeous full booklet reproducing tons of ephemera
from the band... a really great package.

Brett Smiley: Va Va Va Voom 7" (Sing Sing)
The cover on this one had me amped for some early Eno worship, and
thankfully that's exactly what this single delivers. "Va Va Va Voom"
sounds like an unused Roxy Music song title, and it combines the
rocking style of early Roxy with the slightly weirder feel of Here
Come the Warm Jets-era Eno... a really great track. As for the flip,
it's more of a straight up Bowie homage, both musically and lyrically,
but it's pretty killer too.

Down but Not Out: Caught in the Cycle 7" (Painkiller)
Reissue of this rather obscure Boston band's 1999 demo on Painkiller.
I can see why they wanted to reissue this, as it has a lot more in
common with the kind of hardcore people are making now than what
people were making in 1999. Yeah, you can definitely hear a pretty
strong Cro-Mags influence in the rhythms, but at the end of the day
this sounds more like early NYHC like the Abused to me. I love how the
artwork on this totally captures the 90s, but the music is pure early
80s-style fury... recommended.

Lost Kids: Cola Freaks 7" (Sing Sing)
Sing Sing brings the HEAT with their reissue of this seminal
first-wave Euro punker. This single is one of those records that even
the most ardent Anglophile has to acknowledge holds up just as well as
anything from the UK's '77 set. Great cover artwork, big guitars, and
vocal hooks for MILES on this one. If you dig the Rezillos, Adverts,
and the most energetic '77 punk stuff you need this one.

Navastrau: The Navastrau Tapes 1980-1982 cassette (Alona's Dream)
Reissue of various works by this extremely obscure American minimal
synth group, recorded between 1980 and 1982. Not some DIY
thrown-together thing, this is extremely well-recorded, and honestly
sounds quite a lot like the bigger UK bands of the day. It has a
relatively dense sound for a minimal synth group, with even a little
bit of guitar in the mix... in that respect, I think it may have a bit
more glam influence than your standard straight up synth stuff. The
german lady vocalist is also quite strong... 9 songs, and basically a
full-length. Highly recommended if you're into anything from OG
minimal synth to early Eno.

Holder's Scar: demo cassette (self-released)
5-song demo from this new North Carolina band. Very much in the
tradition of North Carolina punk, this is fast and raging hardcore,
but with an undeniably weird slant... like Stripmines, they have a
huge, d-beat-informed sound, but also have shades of Neurosis and
Animosity-era COC in their sound. Recommended if you like the NCHC
stylings of Stripmines and Devour... bruising. Recorded at Legitimate
Business (Future Binds, Abuse., Last Words, etc.) and pressed on
pro-printed tapes, so this sounds GOOD.

Child Support: demo cassette (self-released)
Demo tape from this now-defunct Raleigh HC band. Super raw and
primitive, this sounds like something that would have been buried on
an old BCT tape... pure adolescent rage, maximumally raw.

Vacant Planet: demo cassette (self-released)
Demo tape from this new Raleigh, NC hardcore band. Definite shades of
Direct Control here in the Poison Idea-style riffing, but the frantic
drumming and hoarse vocals give this a distinct Jerry's Kids vibe as
well. 5 songs, raw recording... PUNK. Limited to 50 numbered copies.

Libyans: Expired Language 12" (Sorry State)
It's been a while since we've heard from Boston's Libyans, but
Expired Language proves that the passage of time and the increase of
space between members hasn't blunted this band's attack at all. While
not quite as frantic as A Common Place, you still get plenty of
rapid-fire vocals and Dan's trademark epic snare rolls, but Expired
Language is an entirely subtler and more melodic record than the
previous one. The guitars in particular are stunning; dense and
melodic without leaning on typical punk power chord tropes. And if you
liked the big sing-alongs on A Common Place, then be prepared for
Expired Language to knock you out, because the choruses on this record
are truly epic. The mailorder version is limited to 165 copies on
smoke-colored vinyl.

Alerta!: S/T 7" (Discos Enfermos)
Debut 7" from this Spanish band, recorded at the same session as
their well-received demo. This is vicious, go-for-the-throat hardcore.
It reminds me of the best Ilegal stuff, but this has both more of an
80s texture to the recording and more of a straightforward, punishing
sound. Like that band, though, Alerta! kind of ride the line between
d-beat and more straight up 80s hardcore sounds, and they do it well.
Killer artwork on this one too!

Hard Stripes: S/T 7" (Vinyl Conflict)
Debut 7" from this Richmond hardcore band. Like a lot of recent bands
from Richmond, they have a very tough sound that wouldn't be out of
place on a label like Painkiller... ripping, early 80s-inspired fast
parts alternating with punishing breakdowns, and topped off with a
vocalist definitely in the Choke mold. Ripping.

Green Beret: The Cult of State 7" (Side Two)
Latest EP from this bruising Boston band. This one is a hair
different than their previous 12", a little more straightforward,
perhaps with a little more UK82 influence and a little less d-beat.
Kind of reminds me of the Varukers, but with more straight-up vocals
delivered in a hoarse hardcore shout. You loved their previous records
and you need this one too!

Di=C3=A4t: Everyday 7" (Iron Lung)
Latest single from this Australian-cum-German band, and it delivers
more of their trademark punchy, punk-y post-punk. Those of you who
were lucky enough to grab their demo will recognize "Everyday,"
perhaps the song where their Rikk Agnew influence is most apparent,
and we get an entirely new song on the flip. Another winner from Iron
Lung that successfully whets my appetite for this band's upcoming LP.

Merchandise: BBC Sessions 12" (Strange Songs)
Limited 4-song 12" featuring songs recorded by Merchandise for the
BBC at their legendary Maida Vale Studios. I'm stoked they did my
absolute favorite Merch song, "Anxiety's Door," and it's even better
than it is on Totale Nite, with more of an organic rhythm (courtesy of
REAL LIVE DRUMMER Elsner) and a little bit of a jammy feel to the
guitars. Production-wise, this is right in line with the style you
know and love from countless releases of BBC sessions from bands
through the decades... i.e. it's slightly more raw and looser than the
official studio material, but with none of the compromises in fidelity
that you get with a proper live recording. Pretty darn essential if
you're a Merchandise fan... looks like this is pretty limited, too, so
I would snag it quickly if you want one.

Column of Heaven: Holy Things Are for the Holy 7" (Iron Lung Records)
I don't recall hearing Column of Heaven's earlier recordings, but
apparently they were power violence-oriented. This single, however, is
something else entirely. The label description calls it "industrial"
music, but that makes me think of something like Ministry or Nine Inch
Nails... something with noisy guitars over a steady, Numan-influenced
pulse. However, there's nothing steady here... it's more like musique
concrete, built upon odd, layered samples and (literally) industrial
sounds... like huge machines going haywire and collapsing in on
themselves. Oftentimes this end of noise can feel self-indulgent, but
this is interesting to listen to, and clearly created with a
hardcore-addled, slightly ADD listener in mind. This is nothing like
the music I typically listen to, but honestly I think it's one of the
best records that Iron Lung has put out in ages.

Slag: S/T 7" (Hesitation Wound)
Debut 7" from this Chicago band (now RIP?) who had a great demo a
while back. Their demo had strong UK82 vibes, and I guess that I still
hear that here, but it's a lot more straightforward hardcore. This is
the mean shit... just stomping, writhing hatred, no posing, no trying
to ape a particular band or style, just raw go-for-the-throat
hardcore. When they slow things down on "Liar" your fist is in the air
whether you like or or not. Recommended.

Various: Droppings #1 zine + cassette (Scavenger of Death)
The folks at Scavenger of Death Records return to the fray with this
new project, which is a series of zines with accompanying cassette
compilations. This time around the zine features interviews with Joint
D=E2=89=A0, Total Control, Gary Wrong, and Kremlin, while the tape =
features
tracks from those bands as well Atlanta bands like Predator and GG
King (previews of their respective upcoming LPs), and classic /
obscure Atlanta stuff from the past like Neon Christ, Beatifyx, and
Crooks.

Grump: Love Punk Hate Punks cassette (self-released)
Latest tape from Cody Cross, who you may know from Canadians Negative
Rage. Grump is a bit weirder, though... strange, uncomfortable
hardcore more in the United Mutation / Void mold. For fans of Lumpy &
the Dumpers, Crazy Spirit, etc. In other words, music that has all of
the energy of hardcore but none of the polish and
"I've-heard-it-before" vibes that ruin so many bands.

The Freeze: Freak Show 12" (Gummopunx)
Reissue of the Freeze's 1995 LP, and it's actually the first time
this full-length has made it to vinyl. This came out at the peak of
the 90s pop-punk scene, and while it definitely shows some influence
from that scene (particularly in the rather clean production), this is
still the Freeze and still has a ton of their rough-around-the-edges
sound. If the only things you like are "I Hate Tourists" and Guilty
Face this might not be for you, but if you can still get down with
Land of the Lost I'd recommend checking this out, as it's a
high-energy, catchy punk album along the lines of that record or maybe
Horse Bites-era DI.

Nocturnus: Thresholds 12" (Earache)
Reissue of the landmark 1992 album from this progressive death metal
band. I can only imagine what this must have sounded like in 1992...
with all of the death metal bands getting more and more extreme,
Nocturnus took a complete left turn and started integrating influences
from progressive rock, in particular the wacky time signatures of King
Crimson and the use of synths. The band graft that onto the standard
death metal template, so they never sound wimpy like a prog rock
band... instead it's pure brutality, but weird brutality. While
keyboards in metal is not nearly the taboo that it once was,
Thresholds is still a jarring album that sounds quite different to
anything I've ever heard. Reissued and remastered by Earache Records
to the label's usual top-notch quality standards.

Hard Skin: We Are the Wankers 7" (1234 Go!)
Brand new Hard Skin single released for their recent US tour. This
features "We Are the Wankers" (previously released only in Japan), an
alternate version of "Two Bob Cunt," and a new track called "Fuck It."
Like their previous stuff, this is tongue-in-cheek oi! that somehow
manages to be better than 99% of straight up serious oi!.

Tenement / Screaming Females: Split 7" (Recess)
First up, Screaming Females give us a new track with a haunting,
almost prog-y vibe with the creepy vocals and total shredder vibe
you've come to expect from this utterly unique band. Then there's
Tenement, who are one of my favorite current bands. Their contribution
to this split is listed as one song, but it's really multifaceted,
moving from a kind of Daydream Nation-era Sonic Youth-esque intro into
one of the band's trademark huge choruses, then devolving into an
abstract wash of feedback that goes on for some time. Essential for
fans of both bands.

Hunger: Dying Is Ordinary 7" (Muscle Horse)
Debut 7" from this English band that have been going for quite some
time. Their sound is dark, dischordant, claustrophobic... real
nightmare music, but without resorting to any cliches. Parts of it
actually remind me of later Darkthrone in that it's really rocking,
but also super primitive, but at the same time I wouldn't call this a
metal record at all. It's probably musically closer to something like
the Necros, only without nightmare cries instead of vocals. A really
powerful, intriguing, and totally unique 7" that should be on your
radar if you've been paying attention to the recent UK HC scene. Also
comes in a pretty stunning 2-color screen printed jacket.

Blood Red: See Something Say Something 7" (Braddock Hit Factory)
Latest 7" from this Pennsylvania band that features members of Hounds
of Hate. Like their earlier 12", this is dark, slightly dissonant
hardcore that bears more than a passing resemblance to long-lost
Philadelphia hardcore band Ink & Dagger. The vocals are similarly
snotty, and the music also does a great job of combining 90s HC
influences with a more upbeat punk approach. Like everything out of
Braddock, this is top-shelf stuff executed to the highest quality,
including the pretty darn stunning 3-color screen printed jacket.

Radioactivity: S/T 12" (Dirtnap)
Debut LP from this brand new Marked Men-related band. Radioactivity
actually features BOTH of the main songwriters / singers from the
Marked Men, so as you might expect the differences between the two
bands are fairly minimal. Radioactivity are perhaps a tad less hectic
than MM, not making so much use of this super-fast 16th notes, but it
has all of the great songwriting that you've come to expect from the
Marked Men. I've had this in the shop for a day and I've already
listened to it like 8 times, so obviously it's highly recommended.

Mind Spiders: Inhumanistic 12" (Dirtnap)
Latest LP from this Marked Men-related band. I'm not sure how the
chronology actually works, but it seems as though with Radioactivity
getting going, Mark Ryan now has an outlet for his straight up Marked
Men-style songs, giving Mind Spiders a little bit of freedom to be
something slightly different. They've been new wave-y and keyboard
heavy since the very beginning, but it really feels like that sound is
maturing on Inhumanistic, rather than just being kind of dropped on
top of Ryan's normal songwriting style. Still, fans of everything from
Marked Men to Hex Dispensers to, say, Tubeway Army will find a lot to
like here.

Helta Skelta: Reds 7" (self-released)
Brand new single from this underrated band that has long been a Sorry
State fave. When straight up punk bands like this put out a two-song
single you know they're going to be bringing the fire, and "Reds" is
indeed their best song to date. Like their previous stuff it's heavy,
upbeat, and seems influenced by the long tradition of Aussie punk, but
there's also a lot of Eddy Current Suppression Ring and Total
Control's chiming, bass-driven blend of classic and post-punk in the
sound. This is undoubtedly one you'll be bringing the needle back on
many, many times. As for the flip, it's a real "b-side," a surf-y,
Radio Birdman-esque instrumental, but it's definitely a keeper. I
highly recommend this one... if they keep writing songs like this,
everyone is going to be talking about Helta Skelta soon.

Various: Harsh & Hard cassette (Harsh Reality)
New compilation of current bands from Boston's raw punk scene. This
strikes me as a kind of answer to the recent New York Ground Zero
LP... like that comp, the bands all have a similar, very raw
recording, but the lineup is quite diverse. Includes songs from The
Combat Zone, Flaccid, Leather Daddy, Chain Rank, Green Beret, Exit
Order, The Cringe, Lude Boys, Savageheads, Zipperhead, and Bloodkrow
Butcher.

Hi everyone! The big news this month is that the long-awaited new Libyans =
LP, <i>Expired Language</i>, is out now:<br><br>
<a href=3D"http://t.ymlp274.net/ujjaraueeebarauumacaeuem/click.php" =
title=3D"Untitled by chestyXbond, on Flickr"><img border=3D0 =
src=3D"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3799/11184096243_21af4c0124_z.jpg" =
width=3D"640" height=3D"480" alt=3D"Untitled"></a><br><br>
As you can see, we have some limited copies on smoke-colored vinyl, which =
perfectly matches the gorgeous artwork from Aaron Demuth. These are going =
fast, so don't sleep if you want the limited version! Musically, this =
album picks up where the more melodic songs on <i>A Common Place</i> left =
off, with huge chorus hooks, intricate guitars, and fast and tight =
hardcore drumming. I'm so stoked about this LP, and if you <a =
href=3D"http://t.ymlp274.net/ujbanaueeebaxauumaraeuem/click.php">give it a =
listen on the BandCamp site</a> I'm sure you will be as well. Word on the =
street is that the Libyans are even planning an east coast / midwest tour =
for early next year, so get stoked for that too!<br><br>
This past weekend we had a big Black Friday sale in the shop and online... =
those of you who check the web site regularly or follow us on social media =
heard about that, but I didn't manage to get the email update on time, so =
I've decided to extend part of the sale for another week. There are still =
<a href=3D"http://t.ymlp274.net/ujhalaueeebakauumacaeuem/click.php">deep =
discounts on many Sorry State titles</a>, and all orders over $100 get 15% =
off by entering the coupon code blackfriday at checkout. Hopefully that =
nudge will get those of you who have been thinking about placing a big =
order for a while to take the plunge. The sale runs until Sunday, so get =
your orders in before then!<br><br>
The only other label news at the moment is that the vinyl has now been =
pressed for the new Brain F&ne; LP, but we're running into some issues =
finalizing the artwork (which seems to be a pattern when Alex from Grave =
Mistake is involved... he's a perfectionist!). Hopefully we're still on =
track to get that out sometime this month, but it's probably looking more =
like early January at this point. After that, the label will probably be =
quiet for a little while as I continue to get the store off the =
ground.<br><br>
Speaking of which, Sorry State's downtown Raleigh retail store is going =
great! We're still chock-full of great used records, all of the stuff on =
the web site, and a bunch more stuff like turntables and merch as well. =
Drop by and say hello if you're ever in town!

Hey everyone!<br><br>
It's been an awesome first month working at the Sorry State store.
Even though my approach to listening to records in the store should be =
trying to listen to as many of the new records as possible, there are a =
few records that I find myself listening to on repeat constantly:<br><br>
The new Radioactivity LP is pretty addictive.
While the post-Marked Men band does sound almost exactly like the their =
previous band, I think this LP might be better than at least one or two of =
the Marked Men records.
As far as heavier and hardcore stuff, I've been really digging the new =
Green Beret 7" and
Churchwhip's final EP.
Also, for all of you devotees to the Sorry State label that have not yet =
checked out the new Libyans LP, you NEED to jump on that.
SO good.<br><br>
Alright time for my little plug here:
Like I mentioned last month, my band Mercy Killings is playing a few shows =
in the Northeast this coming week.
All of the shows are stacked with killer bands, so definitely come check =
us out!!
<br><br>
Here's a list of the shows:<br><br>
12/5/2013 - Philly at the Golden Tea House with Low Charge, Paranoias, and =
Cool Life<br><br>
12/6/2013 - Boston at the Cambridge Elk Lodge with Boston Strangler, Waste =
Management, MFP, and Savageheads<br><br>
12/7/2013 - New York at the Acheron with Peacebreakers and =
Missionary<br><br>
You'll all probably be hearing from me again around this time January. =
Thanks for reading! <br>
-Jeff<br><br>

Hey everyone.
It's a month later and I still can't take the Love Triangle LP off my =
turntable.
If you have not gotten it yet then stop reading and order one.
Also the Radioactivity LP has been getting a lot of play.
Aside from listening to those two LPs I've been digging the new Steve =
Ignorant LP,
which is like a weird bizarro Crass with high end production.
A few more suggestions would be the Lip Cream <i>Lonely Rock</i> reissue =
and the Lost Kids reissue, two incredibly solid 7"s that I was excited to =
see come out, the new Libyans LP and the live Repos LP.<br><br>

I have to pretty much reiterate Jeff and Seth's recommendations here... =
the Love Triangle and Radioactivity LPs are still burning up my turntable =
as well, and I've revisited that Repos record quite a bit this month too. =
Also, I can't believe neither Jeff or Seth mentioned the excellent Abused =
reissue (which is out of stock at the moment, but we have more on the way) =
or the new Out Cold LP! Both of those are stone-cold bangers. I've also =
nearly worn the grooves out on the Merchandise <i>BBC Sessions</i> 12", =
but it looks like that is now out of stock as well.<br><br>
Oh, and since we're plugging bands, I might as well note that me and =
Seth's band <a =
href=3D"http://t.ymlp274.net/ujwaaaueeebaaauumataeuem/click.php">No Love =
has a facebook page</a>. Things are a little quiet now, but we're playing =
a show this Saturday at In the Groove Records in Raleigh and we'll be =
gearing up for another recording in January or February. Like us on there =
to keep tabs.<br><br>
Also, as you look through this update please note that it's only a small =
portion of what was added to the site this month... now that I've opened =
the store it's gotten increasingly tough to write descriptions of =
everything and keep it all catalogued here, so consider this a curated =
list of the most noteworthy titles that were added this month. Of course =
everything is listed on the web site, and there are probably 100+ records =
added this month that aren't on this list.<br><br>
Oh, and in case you're wondering, here are our top 10 sellers for =
November:<br><br>
<ol><li>Joint D&ne;: <i>Satan Is Real Again, Again</i> 12" (Sorry State)
<li>Libyans: <i>Expired Language</i> 12" (Sorry State)
<li>The Love Triangle: <i>Clever, Clever</i> 12" (Sorry State)
<li>Various: Harsh & Hard cassette
<li>The #1s: <i>Sharon</i> 7" (Sorry State)
<li>Church Whip: <i>Final</i> 7" (Vinyl Rites)
<li>Merchandise: <i>BBC Sessions</i> 12" (Fan Club)
<li>Green Beret: <i>The Cult of State</i> 7" (Side Two)
<li>Slag: S/T 7" (Hesitation Wound)
<li>Anasazi: <i>Sex with ET</i> 7" (Lexi Flexi)</ol>

Blotter: demo cassette (self-released)<br>
Demo tape from this new Texas band featuring members of Wiccans, Glue, and =
Creamers. Of those three, I'd say Creamers is the closest point of =
comparison, though this is way more hardcore. Just brutal, stomping stuff =
with perfect, early 80s-sounding 4-track production. This sounds like =
something that could have come from the early Touch and Go catalog, maybe =
with a touch of Infest in some of the vocal patterns and the weird =
changes. Definitely one of the best straight up hardcore demos I've heard =
in ages... highly recommended.<br><br>

White Line Fever: S/T 7" (Nothing Is Real)<br>
Debut 7" from this Boston band. This is a ripper... the foundation is =
straight up early 80s HC like the Necros or something like that, but =
there's a bit of a rocking lead guitar thing going on as well. In sounds =
like a way angrier, way more raw Annihilation Time rocking out on some GBH =
covers... totally sick. Great-looking screen printed covers on this bad =
boy too!<br><br>

Last Words: S/T 12" (To Live a Lie)<br>
Finally, the debut LP from Raleigh's Last Words is out! Clearly inspired =
by the X-Claim! catalog as well as the newer crop of Boston bands, this is =
some hard-charging stuff, alternating blistering fast parts with crushing =
breakdowns and topped with some absolutely feral vocals. Ex-Stripmines, =
Devour, Abuse., etc.<br><br>

style=3D"padding-left: 5px" width=3D"175">
Morbid Angel: <i>Covenant</i> 12" (Earache)<br>
Reissue of Morbid Angel's classic 3rd album. On this record they made the =
switch to a semi-major label, but really didn't compromise their sound at =
all. This is still pure death metal... just about all residual elements of =
thrash are gone, leaving a grinding, hulking behemoth of a sound. Like all =
of Earache's recent reissues, this is remastered from the original tapes =
with special care to convey all of the subtleties of the original release. =
Includes a gorgeous full-color gatefold jacket as well.<br><br>

style=3D"padding-right: 5px" width=3D"175">
Out Cold: <i>A Heated Display</i> 12" (Painkiller)<br>
Throughout their long and storied career, Out Cold have never attempted to =
be anything other than Out Cold... they just put out full-length after =
full-length of blazing, uncompromising hardcore in the Negative Approach =
tradition. They never changed genres, got weird, or tried to expand their =
horizons... they just stayed angry, and that's the reason they're =
worshipped. Sadly, the band is no more, but thankfully they recorded a =
wealth of material before their untimely demise, and this LP constitutes a =
significant chunk of it. After the death of Mark Sheehan (who plays guitar =
on these recordings), the band re-enlisted their original vocalist for =
these recordings they honestly haven't lost a step... if anything, his =
vocals are even more Brannon-inspired, and this is as perfect as any other =
Out Cold record. Essential.<br><br>

Abused: <i>Loud and Clear</i> 12" (Radio Raheem)<br>
INCREDIBLE reissue of this NYHC classic. You already know the music =
because you downloaded it years ago, but this contains the classic <i>Loud =
and Clear</i> 7", the demo, and a handful of extremely well-recorded live =
tracks. The real gem here, though, is the packaging. Not only is it a big =
gatefold that reproduces the original artwork, it comes with a completely =
STUNNING 12"x12" full-color booklet with a band history, tons of =
reproductions of interviews, photos, and of course huge reproductions of =
those incredible flyers. An absolutely incredible package... well worth =
every dime, and I guarantee if you love early 80s HC you won't be =
disappointed.<br><br>

style=3D"padding-right: 5px" width=3D"175">
Liverpool Echo: S/T 12" (Sing Sing)<br>
Another case of Sing Sing digging back a little further than the 70s punk =
stuff they're known primarily for, and this one is a gem. Liverpool Echo's =
1973 LP is a slice of unabashed Beatles worship... and honestly I've =
rarely heard better. Clearly the band are in love with the older =
Merseybeat sound rather than the band's later psychedelic and rockin' =
stuff, and they pay a deft homage with these simple, powerful songs. The =
vocalist also sounds uncannily like Paul McCartney, which doesn't hurt =
when you're trying to do something like this. A real front-to-back banger =
that anyone into awesome, high-energy rock and roll should be able to get =
down with.<br><br>

style=3D"padding-left: 5px" width=3D"175">
The High and the Mighty: <i>Crunch on Demo 1984</i> 7" (Radio Raheem)<br>
Radio Raheem reissued this guy at the same time as the long-awaited Abused =
12", and this reissue is definitely up to that standard. I hadn't actually =
heard of the High and Mighty before, but this is straight up early 80s =
NYHC... apparently members went on to Antidote, but really it sounds a lot =
more like the Abused, and you can't beat that authentic early 80s =
production. Like the Abused reissue, this one also comes with a gorgeous =
full booklet reproducing tons of ephemera from the band... a really great =
package.<br><br>
<img border=3D0 height=3D"175" src=3D"http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/025=

style=3D"padding-right: 5px" width=3D"175">
Brett Smiley: <i>Va Va Va Voom</i> 7" (Sing Sing)<br>
The cover on this one had me amped for some early Eno worship, and =
thankfully that's exactly what this single delivers. "Va Va Va Voom" =
sounds like an unused Roxy Music song title, and it combines the rocking =
style of early Roxy with the slightly weirder feel of <i>Here Come the =
Warm Jets</i>-era Eno... a really great track. As for the flip, it's more =
of a straight up Bowie homage, both musically and lyrically, but it's =
pretty killer too.<br><br>

style=3D"padding-left: 5px" width=3D"175">
Down but Not Out: <i>Caught in the Cycle</i> 7" (Painkiller)<br>
Reissue of this rather obscure Boston band's 1999 demo on Painkiller. I =
can see why they wanted to reissue this, as it has a lot more in common =
with the kind of hardcore people are making now than what people were =
making in 1999. Yeah, you can definitely hear a pretty strong Cro-Mags =
influence in the rhythms, but at the end of the day this sounds more like =
early NYHC like the Abused to me. I love how the artwork on this totally =
captures the 90s, but the music is pure early 80s-style fury... =
recommended.<br><br>
<img border=3D0 height=3D"175" src=3D"http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/025=

style=3D"padding-right: 5px" width=3D"175">
Lost Kids: <i>Cola Freaks</i> 7" (Sing Sing)<br>
Sing Sing brings the HEAT with their reissue of this seminal first-wave =
Euro punker. This single is one of those records that even the most ardent =
Anglophile has to acknowledge holds up just as well as anything from the =
UK's '77 set. Great cover artwork, big guitars, and vocal hooks for MILES =
on this one. If you dig the Rezillos, Adverts, and the most energetic '77 =
punk stuff you need this one.<br><br>

Navastrau: <i>The Navastrau Tapes 1980-1982</i> cassette (Alona's =
Dream)<br>
Reissue of various works by this extremely obscure American minimal synth =
group, recorded between 1980 and 1982. Not some DIY thrown-together thing, =
this is extremely well-recorded, and honestly sounds quite a lot like the =
bigger UK bands of the day. It has a relatively dense sound for a minimal =
synth group, with even a little bit of guitar in the mix... in that =
respect, I think it may have a bit more glam influence than your standard =
straight up synth stuff. The german lady vocalist is also quite strong... =
9 songs, and basically a full-length. Highly recommended if you're into =
anything from OG minimal synth to early Eno.<br><br>

Holder's Scar: demo cassette (self-released)<br>
5-song demo from this new North Carolina band. Very much in the tradition =
of North Carolina punk, this is fast and raging hardcore, but with an =
undeniably weird slant... like Stripmines, they have a huge, =
d-beat-informed sound, but also have shades of Neurosis and =
<i>Animosity</i>-era COC in their sound. Recommended if you like the NCHC =
stylings of Stripmines and Devour... bruising. Recorded at Legitimate =
Business (Future Binds, Abuse., Last Words, etc.) and pressed on =
pro-printed tapes, so this sounds GOOD.<br><br>

Child Support: demo cassette (self-released)<br>
Demo tape from this now-defunct Raleigh HC band. Super raw and primitive, =
this sounds like something that would have been buried on an old BCT =
tape... pure adolescent rage, maximumally raw.<br><br>
<img border=3D0 height=3D"175" src=3D"http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/025=

Vacant Planet: demo cassette (self-released)<br>
Demo tape from this new Raleigh, NC hardcore band. Definite shades of =
Direct Control here in the Poison Idea-style riffing, but the frantic =
drumming and hoarse vocals give this a distinct Jerry's Kids vibe as well. =
5 songs, raw recording... PUNK. Limited to 50 numbered copies.<br><br>

Libyans: <i>Expired Language</i> 12" (Sorry State)<br>
It's been a while since we've heard from Boston's Libyans, but <i>Expired =
Language</i> proves that the passage of time and the increase of space =
between members hasn't blunted this band's attack at all. While not quite =
as frantic as <i>A Common Place</i>, you still get plenty of rapid-fire =
vocals and Dan's trademark epic snare rolls, but <i>Expired Language</i> =
is an entirely subtler and more melodic record than the previous one. The =
guitars in particular are stunning; dense and melodic without leaning on =
typical punk power chord tropes. And if you liked the big sing-alongs on =
<i>A Common Place</i>, then be prepared for <i>Expired Language</i> to =
knock you out, because the choruses on this record are truly epic. The =
mailorder version is limited to 165 copies on smoke-colored vinyl.<br><br>

Alerta!: S/T 7" (Discos Enfermos)<br>
Debut 7" from this Spanish band, recorded at the same session as their =
well-received demo. This is vicious, go-for-the-throat hardcore. It =
reminds me of the best Ilegal stuff, but this has both more of an 80s =
texture to the recording and more of a straightforward, punishing sound. =
Like that band, though, Alerta! kind of ride the line between d-beat and =
more straight up 80s hardcore sounds, and they do it well. Killer artwork =
on this one too!<br><br>

Hard Stripes: S/T 7" (Vinyl Conflict)<br>
Debut 7" from this Richmond hardcore band. Like a lot of recent bands from =
Richmond, they have a very tough sound that wouldn't be out of place on a =
label like Painkiller... ripping, early 80s-inspired fast parts =
alternating with punishing breakdowns, and topped off with a vocalist =
definitely in the Choke mold. Ripping.<br><br>

Green Beret: <i>The Cult of State</i> 7" (Side Two)<br>
Latest EP from this bruising Boston band. This one is a hair different =
than their previous 12", a little more straightforward, perhaps with a =
little more UK82 influence and a little less d-beat. Kind of reminds me of =
the Varukers, but with more straight-up vocals delivered in a hoarse =
hardcore shout. You loved their previous records and you need this one =
too!<br><br>

Di&auml;t: <i>Everyday</i> 7" (Iron Lung)<br>
Latest single from this Australian-cum-German band, and it delivers more =
of their trademark punchy, punk-y post-punk. Those of you who were lucky =
enough to grab their demo will recognize "Everyday," perhaps the song =
where their Rikk Agnew influence is most apparent, and we get an entirely =
new song on the flip. Another winner from Iron Lung that successfully =
whets my appetite for this band's upcoming LP.<br><br>

Merchandise: <i>BBC Sessions</i> 12" (Strange Songs)<br>
Limited 4-song 12" featuring songs recorded by Merchandise for the BBC at =
their legendary Maida Vale Studios. I'm stoked they did my absolute =
favorite Merch song, "Anxiety's Door," and it's even better than it is on =
<i>Totale Nite</i>, with more of an organic rhythm (courtesy of REAL LIVE =
DRUMMER Elsner) and a little bit of a jammy feel to the guitars. =
Production-wise, this is right in line with the style you know and love =
from countless releases of BBC sessions from bands through the decades... =
i.e. it's slightly more raw and looser than the official studio material, =
but with none of the compromises in fidelity that you get with a proper =
live recording. Pretty darn essential if you're a Merchandise fan... looks =
like this is pretty limited, too, so I would snag it quickly if you want =
one.<br><br>

Column of Heaven: <i>Holy Things Are for the Holy</i> 7" (Iron Lung =
Records)<br>
I don't recall hearing Column of Heaven's earlier recordings, but =
apparently they were power violence-oriented. This single, however, is =
something else entirely. The label description calls it "industrial" =
music, but that makes me think of something like Ministry or Nine Inch =
Nails... something with noisy guitars over a steady, Numan-influenced =
pulse. However, there's nothing steady here... it's more like musique =
concrete, built upon odd, layered samples and (literally) industrial =
sounds... like huge machines going haywire and collapsing in on =
themselves. Oftentimes this end of noise can feel self-indulgent, but this =
is interesting to listen to, and clearly created with a hardcore-addled, =
slightly ADD listener in mind. This is nothing like the music I typically =
listen to, but honestly I think it's one of the best records that Iron =
Lung has put out in ages.<br><br>

Slag: S/T 7" (Hesitation Wound)<br>
Debut 7" from this Chicago band (now RIP?) who had a great demo a while =
back. Their demo had strong UK82 vibes, and I guess that I still hear that =
here, but it's a lot more straightforward hardcore. This is the mean =
shit... just stomping, writhing hatred, no posing, no trying to ape a =
particular band or style, just raw go-for-the-throat hardcore. When they =
slow things down on "Liar" your fist is in the air whether you like or or =
not. Recommended.<br><br>

Various: Droppings #1 zine + cassette (Scavenger of Death)<br>
The folks at Scavenger of Death Records return to the fray with this new =
project, which is a series of zines with accompanying cassette =
compilations. This time around the zine features interviews with Joint =
D&ne;, Total Control, Gary Wrong, and Kremlin, while the tape features =
tracks from those bands as well Atlanta bands like Predator and GG King =
(previews of their respective upcoming LPs), and classic / obscure Atlanta =
stuff from the past like Neon Christ, Beatifyx, and Crooks.<br><br>

Grump: <i>Love Punk Hate Punks</i> cassette (self-released)<br>
Latest tape from Cody Cross, who you may know from Canadians Negative =
Rage. Grump is a bit weirder, though... strange, uncomfortable hardcore =
more in the United Mutation / Void mold. For fans of Lumpy & the Dumpers, =
Crazy Spirit, etc. In other words, music that has all of the energy of =
hardcore but none of the polish and "I've-heard-it-before" vibes that ruin =
so many bands.<br><br>

The Freeze: <i>Freak Show</i> 12" (Gummopunx)<br>
Reissue of the Freeze's 1995 LP, and it's actually the first time this =
full-length has made it to vinyl. This came out at the peak of the 90s =
pop-punk scene, and while it definitely shows some influence from that =
scene (particularly in the rather clean production), this is still the =
Freeze and still has a ton of their rough-around-the-edges sound. If the =
only things you like are "I Hate Tourists" and <i>Guilty Face</i> this =
might not be for you, but if you can still get down with <i>Land of the =
Lost</i> I'd recommend checking this out, as it's a high-energy, catchy =
punk album along the lines of that record or maybe <i>Horse Bites</i>-era =
DI.<br><br>

Nocturnus: <i>Thresholds</i> 12" (Earache)<br>
Reissue of the landmark 1992 album from this progressive death metal band. =
I can only imagine what this must have sounded like in 1992... with all of =
the death metal bands getting more and more extreme, Nocturnus took a =
complete left turn and started integrating influences from progressive =
rock, in particular the wacky time signatures of King Crimson and the use =
of synths. The band graft that onto the standard death metal template, so =
they never sound wimpy like a prog rock band... instead it's pure =
brutality, but <i>weird</i> brutality. While keyboards in metal is not =
nearly the taboo that it once was, <i>Thresholds</i> is still a jarring =
album that sounds quite different to anything I've ever heard. Reissued =
and remastered by Earache Records to the label's usual top-notch quality =
standards.<br><br>

Brand new Hard Skin single released for their recent US tour. This =
features "We Are the Wankers" (previously released only in Japan), an =
alternate version of "Two Bob Cunt," and a new track called "Fuck It." =
Like their previous stuff, this is tongue-in-cheek oi! that somehow =

Tenement / Screaming Females: Split 7" (Recess)<br>
First up, Screaming Females give us a new track with a haunting, almost =
prog-y vibe with the creepy vocals and total shredder vibe you've come to =
expect from this utterly unique band. Then there's Tenement, who are one =
of my favorite current bands. Their contribution to this split is listed =
as one song, but it's really multifaceted, moving from a kind of =
<i>Daydream Nation</i>-era Sonic Youth-esque intro into one of the band's =
trademark huge choruses, then devolving into an abstract wash of feedback =
that goes on for some time. Essential for fans of both bands.<br><br>

Hunger: <i>Dying Is Ordinary</i> 7" (Muscle Horse)<br>
Debut 7" from this English band that have been going for quite some time. =
Their sound is dark, dischordant, claustrophobic... real nightmare music, =
but without resorting to any cliches. Parts of it actually remind me of =
later Darkthrone in that it's really rocking, but also super primitive, =
but at the same time I wouldn't call this a metal record at all. It's =
probably musically closer to something like the Necros, only without =
nightmare cries instead of vocals. A really powerful, intriguing, and =
totally unique 7" that should be on your radar if you've been paying =
attention to the recent UK HC scene. Also comes in a pretty stunning =
2-color screen printed jacket.<br><br>

Blood Red: <i>See Something Say Something</i> 7" (Braddock Hit =
Factory)<br>
Latest 7" from this Pennsylvania band that features members of Hounds of =
Hate. Like their earlier 12", this is dark, slightly dissonant hardcore =
that bears more than a passing resemblance to long-lost Philadelphia =
hardcore band Ink & Dagger. The vocals are similarly snotty, and the music =
also does a great job of combining 90s HC influences with a more upbeat =
punk approach. Like everything out of Braddock, this is top-shelf stuff =
executed to the highest quality, including the pretty darn stunning =
3-color screen printed jacket.<br><br>

Radioactivity: S/T 12" (Dirtnap)<br>
Debut LP from this brand new Marked Men-related band. Radioactivity =
actually features BOTH of the main songwriters / singers from the Marked =
Men, so as you might expect the differences between the two bands are =
fairly minimal. Radioactivity are perhaps a tad less hectic than MM, not =
making so much use of this super-fast 16th notes, but it has all of the =
great songwriting that you've come to expect from the Marked Men. I've had =
this in the shop for a day and I've already listened to it like 8 times, =
so obviously it's highly recommended.<br><br>

Mind Spiders: <i>Inhumanistic</i> 12" (Dirtnap)<br>
Latest LP from this Marked Men-related band. I'm not sure how the =
chronology actually works, but it seems as though with Radioactivity =
getting going, Mark Ryan now has an outlet for his straight up Marked =
Men-style songs, giving Mind Spiders a little bit of freedom to be =
something slightly different. They've been new wave-y and keyboard heavy =
since the very beginning, but it really feels like that sound is maturing =
on <i>Inhumanistic</i>, rather than just being kind of dropped on top of =
Ryan's normal songwriting style. Still, fans of everything from Marked Men =
to Hex Dispensers to, say, Tubeway Army will find a lot to like =
here.<br><br>

Helta Skelta: <i>Reds</i> 7" (self-released)<br>
Brand new single from this underrated band that has long been a Sorry =
State fave. When straight up punk bands like this put out a two-song =
single you know they're going to be bringing the fire, and "Reds" is =
indeed their best song to date. Like their previous stuff it's heavy, =
upbeat, and seems influenced by the long tradition of Aussie punk, but =
there's also a lot of Eddy Current Suppression Ring and Total Control's =
chiming, bass-driven blend of classic and post-punk in the sound. This is =
undoubtedly one you'll be bringing the needle back on many, many times. As =
for the flip, it's a real "b-side," a surf-y, Radio Birdman-esque =
instrumental, but it's definitely a keeper. I highly recommend this one... =
if they keep writing songs like this, everyone is going to be talking =
about Helta Skelta soon.<br><br>

Various: <i>Harsh & Hard</i> cassette (Harsh Reality)<br>
New compilation of current bands from Boston's raw punk scene. This =
strikes me as a kind of answer to the recent New York Ground Zero LP... =
like that comp, the bands all have a similar, very raw recording, but the =
lineup is quite diverse. Includes songs from The Combat Zone, Flaccid, =
Leather Daddy, Chain Rank, Green Beret, Exit Order, The Cringe, Lude Boys, =
Savageheads, Zipperhead, and Bloodkrow Butcher.<br><br>
