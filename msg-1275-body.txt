   Dear Alexander,

   This email is to follow up on your interest in Pratt's [1]graduate
   fine arts program, located in Brooklyn, New York.  As you may know,
    Pratt is ranked one of the top design schools in the US by
   Business Week, and offers a wide variety of highly ranked graduate
   art, design and architecture programs from which to choose.I hope
   you'll join us at our fine arts graduate information session on
   February 11. [2]Register here for our February 11 information
   session at 10am on the Brooklyn campus.

   [3]The Master of Fine Arts program at Pratt Institute, ranked among
   the top 15 programs in the country by US News and World Reports
   Best Graduate Schools,  offers the following major areas of
   emphasis: painting/drawing, printmaking, sculpture, photography and
   new forms (nontraditional investigations).  Students complete two
   semesters of course work in their major area of emphasis and one
   year of work on a Master of Fine Arts thesis in their major area,
   including a written thesis statement and a solo graduate exhibition
   in our graduate galleries. Degree requirements include nine credits
   in art criticism/history and six credits in the liberal arts.
   Twenty-seven elective credits may be used for a wide variety of
   interdisciplinary, studio, or technical courses in any graduate
   level studio class in the Institute. Pratt also offers a dual
   degree in  Art History and Fine Art.  You may also apply for the MS
   in History of Art or for the Certificate in Art & Design Education
   combined programs after you begin the MFA Fine Arts program if you
   develop an interest in those areas of study.

   Pratt is not a school of a specific type of work. Although the
   students apply in an area of emphasis, the program is designed to
   encourage a wide variety of interdisciplinary and cross-
   disciplinary study. It is our goal to encourage students to develop
   their vision in ways they could not have anticipated before
   arriving at Pratt.  The Faculty, all of whom are practicing
   artists, are incredibly generous in their interactions with
   students, bringing with them an interest in conceptual ideas along
   with a respect for the achievement of craft.
   Pratt is still accepting [4]applications for fall 2012. [5]General
   application requirements are online as are the [6]department
   requirements including portfolio (and TOEFL requirements for
   international students). The GRE is required only for art history,
   the M.Arch first professional architecture degree, and the dual
   degree in art history and library science.

   Pratt's main campus, 25 minutes from Manhattan, is  a 25-acre
   beautiful  tree-lined campus with wonderful facilities, brick
   pathways, a residence hall two blocks away for graduate students,
   and a contemporary [7]sculpture park on campus, ranked one of the
   best in the country. All make Pratt's Brooklyn campus an ideal
   choice for students looking for full-time study.  The Manhattan
   campus, which houses library and information science, design
   management, arts and cultural management, historic preservation,
   communications and package design, and facilities management
   graduate programs, is located in Chelsea. The library and
   information science program is there as well.  The Manhattan campus
   is located at 144 West 14^th Street between 6^th and 7^th Avenues,
   and programs are offered on weekends and evenings in addition to
   some during the day. Below find a list of programs at each campus.

   BROOKLYN CAMPUS (includes fine arts, architecture, city and
   regional planning, urban design, environmental systems management,
   art and design education, art history, art therapy, arts and
   cultural management, digital arts, dance therapy, fine arts,
   industrial design, interior design)

   MANHATTAN CAMPUS (includes communications design, package design,
   historic preservation, design management, arts and cultural
   management, facilities management, library and information science)
