Dischord Records Newsletter: November 2014

New Releases out November 18th

Fugazi "First Demo"
In early January 1988 and after only ten shows, Fugazi decided to go =
into Inner Ear Studio to see what their music sounded like on tape. =
Despite the fact that Ian, Joe, and Brendan had been playing together =
for nearly a year, it was still early days for the band. Guy had only =
been a full member of Fugazi for a few months and only sang lead on one =
song ("Break In"). It would be nearly another year before he would start =
playing guitar with the band.

The sessions only lasted a couple of days, but tour dates and indecision =
about the tape would delay the final mix for another two months. Though =
the band was at first pleased with the results, it soon became clear =
that this tape would remain a demo as new songs were being written and =
the older songs were evolving and changing shape while the band was out =
on tour. It was decided that the session would be passed out free as =
cassette copies, with the band actively encouraging people to share the =
recording. In the spring, Fugazi went out on its first U.S. tour and a =
few weeks after returning from the road they went back to Inner Ear to =
record what would become their debut Dischord release, the self-titled =
7-song 12" EP.

The only song from the demo session that was formally released was "In =
Defense of Humans", which appeared on the State of the Union compilation =
in 1989. Now, some 26 years later, Dischord is releasing the entire =
first demo including the one song ("Turn Off Your Guns") that wasn't =
included on the original cassette.

The record is out November 18th, but is available for pre-order now. =
Listen to "Merchandise" here.

Rollins Band "Life Time"
Originally released in 1987 by Texas Hotel, Life Time is the full-length =
debut by Rollins Band. The record was recorded in Leeds, UK with Geoff =
Clout and produced by Ian MacKaye. Long out of print on LP, this reissue =
=E2=80=94 released on Rollins' 2.13.61 label =E2=80=94 has been =
remastered by TJ Lipple and pressed on grey-colored vinyl. The digital =
download includes the album tracks as well as five extra songs recorded =
live in Kortrijk, Belgium on October 16, 1987.

The reissue is out November 18th and available for pre-order now.

Wedding Dress "Desperate Glow"
Formed in Chicago as a creative side project for Maps & Atlases =
guitarist Erin Elders, Wedding Dress has grown to include Mike Russell =
and Matt Lemke (Suns), Bobby Burg (Love of Everything/Joan of Arc) and =
Christian Dawson (Gypsyblood). The eclectic line-up lends itself to the =
distinct complexity of Wedding Dress' debut full-length, Desperate Glow. =
Staying true to the group's blend of dreamy alternative and pop, Erin =
Elders' distinguished vocals are ghostly at times, delivering narratives =
with memorable and haunting choruses. Elders himself describes the songs =
on the album as having a unique sense of space: "almost confusing and =
dream-like."

The record is out November 18th via Lovitt Records and available for =
pre-order now. The band will tour the U.S. throughout November and =
December.

Out Now on Dischord

Slant 6 "Soda Pop Rip Off"
After nearly two decades out of print, Slant 6's debut full-length, Soda =
Pop*Rip Off, is back on LP. Formed in Washington, DC in 1992, Slant 6 =
was Christina Billotte (Autoclave, Quix*o*tic), Myra Power, and Marge =
Marshall. The trio released two albums and a single on Dischord before =
breaking up in 1995. This reissue has been remastered by TJ Lipple and =
is pressed on red-colored vinyl. Listen to "Time Expired" here.

Soul Side's "Trigger/Bass=C2=B7103" LP Out Now
This release compiles Soul Side's 1988 Trigger EP with the band's =
three-song single, Bass=C2=B7103, both of which have been out-of-print =
on vinyl since the early '90s. The record has been remastered by TJ =
Lipple and pressed on yellow vinyl. Formed in 1986, Soul Side was Bobby =
Sullivan, Scott McCloud, Alexis Fleisig, and Johnny Temple. Originally =
called Lunchmeat, the band released a split-single and =E2=80=92 after =
switching names =E2=80=92 a full-length on Sammich Records. Recorded in =
1987 with Don Zientara, Ian MacKaye, and Eli Janney at Inner Ear =
Studios, Trigger was the Soul Side's first release on Dischord. The band =
would go on to record a single and one LP =E2=80=92Hot Bodi-Gram=E2=80=92 =
before disbanding in 1989. Members went on to perform in Girls Against =
Boys, Rain Like the Sound of Trains, and Obits along with other bands.

New and Notable from Dischord Mail Order

 				 				=09
Ar-Kaics S/t
The full-length debut LP from Virgina-based trio, The Ar-Kaics. Thirteen =
slightly spaced-out and stripped-down garage-rock songs that stand up =
alongside the deepest Pebbles and Nuggets cuts. Features members of The =
Shirks and Pygmy Lush. Preview this record here.

Roomrunner Separate
Six new tunes from Maryland-based quartet, Roomrunner. The follow up to =
their debut full-length, Ideal Cities, Separate was recorded in late =
2013 with J. Robbins (Jawbox, Burning Airlines) at Magpie Cage studio. =
On its early EPs, guitarist/singer Denny Bowen wrote and performed most =
of the band's music on his own. This time around, though, the band has =
made the songwriting process more collaborative and pushed the material =
in a more overtly melodic direction. It's still plenty heavy, though. =
You can preview "Chrono Trigger" here.

Crimson Wave Say/Calling You
The debut single from Maryland indie-pop outfit, Crimson Wave. Two songs =
that recall the reverb-heavy lo-fi sounds of Galaxie 500 and Felt. =
Preview this record here.

	 <p>The full-length debut LP from Virgina-based trio, The =
Ar-Kaics. Thirteen slightly spaced-out and stripped-down garage-rock =
songs that stand up alongside the deepest Pebbles and Nuggets cuts. =

							 <p>Six new =
tunes from Maryland-based quartet, Roomrunner. The follow up to their =
debut full-length, <em>Ideal Cities</em>, <em>Separate</em> was recorded =
in late 2013 with J. Robbins (Jawbox, Burning Airlines) at Magpie Cage =
studio. On its early EPs, guitarist/singer Denny Bowen wrote and =
performed most of the band's music on his own. This time around, though, =
the band has made the songwriting process more collaborative and pushed =
the material in a more overtly melodic direction. It's still plenty =
heavy, though. You can preview "Chrono Trigger" <a =

		 <p>The debut single from Maryland indie-pop outfit, =
Crimson Wave. Two songs that recall the reverb-heavy lo-fi sounds of =
Galaxie 500 and Felt. Preview this record <a =
