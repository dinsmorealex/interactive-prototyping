Arts Collective
Available: Aug. 1st, 2013 through Aug. 1st, 2014
Studios opening at Fowler Arts Collective! Please see the link below for ph=

of the Fowler studios.
1. $345, 140 sq.ft. Semi-private. Aug. 1st. Sharing allowed though one pers=
on would
probably be more comfortable.
2. $425, 170 sq.ft. Semi-private. Aug. 15th. Sharing allowed.
3. $480, 180 sq.ft. Private. Aug. 1st. This studio is located on the 6th  f=
loor,
 so it is not a part of the Fowler space. It has been built  within my own =
space
 upstairs and is a great private room. It does not  have a window to the ou=
tside
 though there are windows at the top of the  wall allowing in natural light=
 while
preserving privacy.
The studios at Fowler are private and semi-private with communal space  and=
 a large
gallery/ project space. Studios are housed on the second  floor of the hist=
oric=20
Greenpoint Terminal Market building. The building  is located at the corner=
 of Noble
and West St. about two blocks from the  Greenpoint Ave G stop on the waterf=
ront.
 These studios are work-only  with 24-hour access, internet, elevator, nort=
h and
 south facing windows,  and a great community of artists.
Fowler offers communal facilities such as hang-out areas, refrigerator,  mi=
crowave,
bottled water, a chop saw, and shared use of other tools and  equipment. Ar=
tists
 are able to participate in annual open studios  events, and artists are al=
so able
to propose exhibitions to be  considered for the gallery.

is still to be determined.
WHO ARE WE LOOKING FOR?
We'd love to share the space with a few more folks who would be excited  to=
 have
 a place to work on art, music, crafts, projects, or generally  need a spac=
e away
from home to be creative.
We're open to reconfiguring the space to best share it, depending on what y=
ou do.
The neighbors upstairs generally don't mind noise during the day, but  afte=
r 8 or
9pm, we try to keep it down. Loud instruments (drums, brass,  etc) wouldn't=
 be optimal.
MONTHLY RENT
The monthly rent on the space is flexible - we've listed $250 as a  startin=
g point,
but we'd try to come up with something fair, probably  between $200 and $35=
0, depending
on your needs.
WHO ELSE IS THERE?
We are three friendly creative folks who are looking for 1-3 additional spa=
ce-mates.
Jordan: She is a musician and founding member of the band, My Body. She  li=
ves,=20
works at a restaurant, and creates music in 3 separate locations  along the=
 B38=20
bus line.
Darren: The other 1/2 of My Body and also 1/2 of the Mobile Pool project  (=
google
"Mobile Pool" and see the kickstarter page). A very friendly  & boisterous =
fellow.
Dean: He's 1/2 of Mobile Pool and lives 1/2 in Brooklyn and 1/2 in Providen=
ce, so
he's merely 1/2 of a person.
GET IN TOUCH!
Please get in touch if you'd like to meet us and check out the Pool-House w=
orkshop.

Available: 09/01/2013 through 02/01/2014
I am subletting my fantastic studio for six months.  Located at the  increa=

popular 1717 Troutman building.  As well as being a hot bed  of activity in=

as new and amazing  restaurants and bars.
The space itself has the ability to host a number of different medium  and =
comes
 with a gorgeous window for natural light if you're a painter,  and a poure=
d concrete
floor for more heavy duty projects.
Elevator access, keypad entry system and a patio roof for taking breaks.
I am subletting the space for six months ideally - however, I am willing  t=
o negotiate
if someone has a different time frame in mind. Don't  hesitate to ask quest=
ions.

$400.00 per month, Williamsburg, Desk Space Available - work among a variet=
y of=20
creative professionals
Available: August 1st through ----
The Bakery is a coworking space founded in 2013 by Jason Kachadourian and A=
sa Pingree.
Like most big projects, it started out with talk of getting a small  space,=
 a shop
in which to make furniture collaboratively. Both founders  connected over a=
 shared
interest in furniture, and have worked in  numerous fields and disciplines;=
 as the
project grew, the two realized  that there was no reason to limit their ran=
ge of
 interests, and became  interested in adding collaborators.
The Bakery was then created for people like Jason and Asa: trained in  the =
arts,
 and working in New York, across a variety of processes. The  resulting spa=
ce, organized
in a former kosher bakery, features a series  of six small studios, about a=
 dozen
desk spaces, and a spacious communal  room that can be used for meetings, p=
hotoshoots,
project planning, or  sharing an XXL order of enchiladas from Mexico 2000.
There is also limited access to a fully-equipped woodshop and a roof  garde=
n. A=20
small storefront will serve as a showcase for the space,  featuring project=
s from
Bakery members, as well as guest curators and  organizers.
We have been carefully selecting our new studio mates and, as of the end  o=
f July,
most of the studio spaces have been filled. We are now  conducting intervie=
ws with
people looking for desk space.

$650 per month, Astoria, Huge girls apartment
Available: Sept 1, 2013 through Sept 1, 2014
Hi,
I'm looking for 2-3 female roommates for a year lease starting on September=
 1st.
The place is huge and there is even a sun room. The rent ranges from  $600-=
700 based
on the size of your room. Also, it's been passed down  over the years so it=
's pretty
furnished-and the current tenants may be  willing to sell some of their fur=
niture.
The neighborhood is affordable and great. It has every kind of food  (Greek=
, Italian,
Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Australian,  Mexican...). Plus, the apart=
ment=20
is only a few blocks from Single Cut  Brewery (they're a bit hoppy for me, =
but good
local beer never hurts).
About me: I am friendly, busy, open-minded, and clean. I work for a  magazi=
ne and
I am a full time graduate journalism student. My standards  are: respectful=
, responsible,
and able to pay the rent. It is important  to me that the public area stays=
 clean
and friendly. Good people &  good vibes are welcome.
I love pets (but you have to negotiate with the landlord).
Feel free to contact me if you have questions or to request more info.

$688 per month, Bed-Stuy/Bushwick, 1 Private Bedroom with window and spacio=
us closet
Available: 8/1/2013 through 1/31/14
1 bedroom for 1 person available starting August 1st! The room has a  windo=
w and
 your own closet, with shelves. It's not huge, but it's not a  closet (I kn=
ow because
I've lived in one), and it's a good deal when a  lot of stuff in the area i=
s starting
to get more expensive. The  apartment is on the second floor of a small bui=
lding
 which is only 3  blocks away from the J/M stop at Myrtle/Broadway. 4 or 5 =
blocks
to J at  Kosciuszko. Every room in the apartment has windows, big tall ones=
, so=20
 lots of natural light, which is one of my favorite things about the  place=
. Also
there's fire escape access from kitchen. Roommate should  ideally have a jo=
b or=20
some kind of project going on to occupy their  time. Whatever you do is coo=
l, as
 long as it's not hanging around the  house watching Netflix. That said, I =
don't
 care how you make your money,  as long as you pay before the 1st of each m=
onth.
 Guarantor signature  may be required if no proof of income can be provided=
.
I am an artist who works at an art magazine and also helps run a zine  libr=
ary in
the neighborhood. I spend a lot of time in my room quietly  working on my o=
wn projects
or doing freelance work. Since I work from  home, ideally I'd like someone =
who works
out of the house. Looking for  someone responsible, clean, and generally ch=
eerful
who likes to keep  their apartment as their place to come home to, away fro=
m the
 craziness  of the city. Overnight guests fine, some people are a little co=
ntrolling
 on this issue, but you're an adult (hopefully) and should do as you  pleas=
e provided
you're considerate. No Pets.
Utilities are electricity, gas, and internet (heat+hot water is covered  by=
 landlord),
and run to at most $50 per person per month, usually less.  Security deposi=
t the
 same amount as one month's rent is due upon  move-in, which will be return=
ed to
 you upon move out provided you leave  the room/apartment as you found it. =
Recycling
is a must here, I make it  very simple and easy to follow. You should contr=
ibute
 to apartment  expenses as necessary (toilet paper, dish soap, etc.), clean=
 up after
 yourself, and occasionally sweep as needed. This is a nice apartment,  def=
initely
what you make of it!

curity
deposit to move in. The lease is in my name so this  is a month to month ag=

The neighborhood is great and super safe! I've been in this apartment  for =
3 years
and there are bars and coffee shops within 3 blocks on every  (almost) corn=
er. We're
also 2 blocks from Maria Hernandez park which is  just lovely and always ha=
s fun
 things going on as well as a dog run.  The building also has a fantastic h=
uge backyard
with a grill, picnic  table, and 5 raised 4x8 garden beds, we also have roo=
f access
and one of  the best views I've seen in Brooklyn!

$780 per month, East Williamsburg, 15' x 4.5', Furnished, cute and cozy bed=
room=20
in 2BR apartment.
Available: August 15 through whenever
I'm looking for a roommate (preferably female) to live in 1 furnished  bedr=
oom in
a 2 bedroom/ 1 bathroom apartment. Rent per month is $780  plus utilities $=
60 (internet,
gas, electricity). The room is already  furnished with a futon bed and a co=
uple=20
of other shelving/drawer pieces.  The apartment is 1/2 a block from the Mon=
trose
 stop on the L. There's a  24 hour grocery store one block away. Laundry is=
 also
 one block away  (and they do drop-off service). There are several great ba=
rs, =20
restaurants, and shops in the area.
There is a big closet in the bedroom and there are two windows that open  t=
o the
 inside of the apartment. The room is long and narrow but it is  quite cozy=
 and=20
thankfully there are very high ceilings. The AC is in the  kitchen, so that=
 does
 well to cool the bedroom. There is a tiny living  room between the two bed=
rooms
 with a sleeper sofa and a large flat  screen tv.
A little bit about me: I am 28 yr old female that manages the art  gallery =
at an
 art school during the day and paints weeknights/weekends  at my art studio=
. If=20
I am not at work or in my studio, then I am out at  art openings, with frie=
nds,=20
etc. so I am not home that much. On  occasion, I like having a couple of fr=
iends
 over, and I would be happy  for you to have you friends over, too! When I =
am home,
I'm pretty quiet  because I am usually home to just sleep these days, and I=
 really
like to  keep things neat and CLEAN. (I understand, we all make messes, but=
  there's
a difference between messy and dirty.) I don't have any pets,  and I don't =
smoke
 so I prefer to keep it that way inside the apartment.
Please say a bit about yourself and how long you would plan on staying.  On=
e month's
rent plus one month's security required to stay.

state;
the apartment feels like a home.

$1450 per month, Brooklyn Heights, Spacious, sunny room in lovely Brooklyn =
Heights
brownstone apartment
Available: 08/05/13
I am giving up a fantastic room in Brooklyn Heights to move abroad so  the =
search
is on for a new roommate to take over my gorgeous room in a  Brooklyn Heigh=
ts brownstone
apartment.
The room is very large and private with hardwood floors. It has two big  st=
reet-facing
windows that overlook a quaint, quiet tree-lined street  and let in lots of=
 natural
light. There are two small closets as well as  one large closet area with b=
uilt-in
shelf space. I very comfortably fit  a full-sized bed, desk, small couch, t=
wo end
tables, and bookshelf in  the room. Plus, a non-working fireplace gives the=
 room
 a lot of  character.
The apartment takes up the entire third floor of a lovely, secure  brownsto=
ne. It
is spacious and clean with a shared living/dining room  and kitchen area, a=
ll with
exposed brick. Three other roommates (2 girls  and 1 guy) in their late 20s=
-early
30s also live in the apartment. They  are all very cool, respectful and won=
derful
people to live with. The  first girl is from Michigan and works in costume =
design
for theater. The  second girl is from Maine and a teacher at a nearby priva=
te school.
The  guy is from Ohio and just finished his masters in Economics. All have =
 lived
in the city for 5+ years and have active, busy lives outside the  apartment=
 but=20
we occasionally chat over food or go out together.
The apartment is located on Henry Street, which is peaceful and safe  with =
gorgeous
brownstones and tons of cafes, bars, shops and grocery  stores nearby, incl=
uding
 Trader Joes! It is conveniently just a few  blocks from the Borough Hall 2=
/3/4/5
and Court Street R stops, and a  short walk from the Jay Street A/C/F stop.=
 The=20
Brooklyn Heights  Promenade is about a five-minute walk away.
In terms of roommate criteria, I'd love to find a nice, clean and  respectf=
ul person
who will fit in well with my friendly roommates in  this lovely home. They =
are looking
for a roommate who wants to make the  apartment their home and ensure it is=
 a quiet
oasis from the city,  especially on weeknights.
You should be able to commit to a full year lease that would begin  Septemb=
er 1st
and be employed full-time. Full-time graduate students  will also be consid=
ered.
 Candidates should be non-smokers, in the  similar age range as current roo=
mmates,
and willing to pitch in to keep  the common spaces clean. There is no TV in=
 the=20
common area, but I did  keep one in my room.
Rent is $1,450.00 per month with heat included. We split the other utilitie=
s like
electricity and internet.
Move-in is preferably early to mid August. Also, to move in you will need t=
o:
-=09Get a basic credit check done by our management company which costs $ 7=
5.00
-=09Sign a one-year lease starting September 1st with the three other roomm=
ates in
 the apartment
-=09Pay a security deposit of $2,400.00 directly to the management company,=
 which=20
is refunded when you move out.
Note: the room can come furnished or unfurnished, as I am looking to sell m=
y queen
bed, desk, small couch and large-screen TV.
Please get in touch if you're interested, and tell us a bit about yourself!

$700 per month, Midwood, Conscious Supportive Community
Available: september 1 st
For many years now, I've been wanting to live in a very particular kind  of=
 community
with other like minded individuals who are deeply committed  to individual =
and collective
development and awakening, supporting one  another, and collaboratively cre=
ating
 something together that has the  potential to uplift, enrich and inspire u=
s all.
About three days ago I found this beautiful giant Victorian mansion in  Mid=
wood=20
Brooklyn, a few stops off the Q/B from Prospect Park. The  neighborhood is =
amazing,
so quite and peaceful it feels almost like your  upstate.  And the house it=
self=20
is Amazing! It's so big and spacious and  has a very energetically open, ci=
rcular
spiraling upward feel.  All of  the rooms are really, really big and the la=
rgest
 one, which is still  available, is gigantic. There's an outdoor area, a 2-=
car garage
with  driveway, a fireplace, huge living room and dinning room and it even =
has =20
a Jacuzzi on the 3rd floor.
We are now in the final process of putting our group together and so far  w=
e have
a pretty amazing group with a balanced mix of men and women  relatively div=
erse=20
ages twenties to forties with one or two large and  smaller bedrooms left.
We are ourselves, and are looking for others who consider themselves on a  =
spiritual
path, who have a deep spiritual practice and who are  committed to there ow=
n development
not just limited to spirituality but  other areas of development including =
emotional,
psychological, and  interpersonal, communicative etc.!
It really excited us to think about living with other meditators, yogis,  a=
nd other
spiritual aspirants of all kinds who are also able to sustain  and support =
themselves
financially and who are really interested in  living together, supporting o=
ne another,
collaboratively developing and  exploring new ways of interacting, solving =
problems,
relating in more  and more genuine and authentic ways, while deepening and =
growing
and  Together creating a home that can also really elevate and inspire all =
of  us
beyond any of our wildest dreams.
We're still in the process of trying to figure out the breakdown of the  ro=
oms and
the exact prices we have are range from smaller rooms around  $700-750 and =
others
upward from there including the largest that is  seriously the size of a bi=
g studio
that we're thinking would be great  for a couple depending on the breakdown=
 around
$1100-1300, an amazing  deal either way.
Details:
The move in date will be September 1st 2013 and we will be submitting an ap=
plication
within the next day or so.
To move in each roommate needs to have first months rent, a security  depos=
it and
we have to pay a brokers fee. All in the amount of rent that  person will b=
e paying
for his/her room.  Example: rent $750 need to  have 3x$750 =3D $2250 and be=
 able to
show with tax records, w-2, past pay  stubs etc. that you will be able to c=
over=20
your share of the rent moving  forward.
Planning to show the house and get everyone together today, tonight,  tomor=
row and
it's a bit fast paced need to have our crew together to  submit the applica=
tion.
If your reading this and it sounds like something you'd be into please  giv=
e me=20
a call or email me. Welcome to share a little bit about yourself  and leave=
 your
 telephone number so we can speak in person!
Ok! Thank You!...look forward to hearing from you!...and many blessings on =
your=20
journey! Love and Light!

LIVE/WORK

$950 per month, Bushwick, 8'x7', and 11'x 17', Perfect Live/ Work
Available: August 1st through indefinitely
Two rooms available together in Bushwick for $950. One 8' x 11' room  with =
a closet,
and one 11' x 17' room, both for $950. They are not being  offered individu=
ally=20
so please do not ask.
The rooms both receive a good amount of natural light , and the larger  roo=
m has
 a medium size bay window. The larger room makes a perfect  studio space fo=
r being
so spacious; the ceiling height in both are  roughly 12'. For those interes=
ted in
a live/ work this is pretty ideal.
You would be sharing the rest of the apartment (sunny kitchen, medium  size=
d living
room, and a bathroom) with one other roommate; myself.  There are plenty of=
 little
closets and extra storage spaces which are  one of my personal favorite fea=
tures
 about this apartment, in addition  to the natural light. The apartment is =
within
a quick walk to the Myrtle  Wyckoff station (on the L and M lines), though =
it is
 also far enough  that it isn't an aural burden.  A lot of families reside =
here=20
in the  neighborhood, so there is a real domestic, and tranquil air to the =
 street
by comparison with other streets here in Bushwick. And, of  course, there a=
re ample
delis, bodegas, restaurants, and cafes nearby.  Utilities and internet gene=
rally
 run about $60 per month.
I'm in my mid 30's, and a painter; who is interested in keeping a clean,  q=
uiet,
 cozy apartment as a functional nest. I consider myself to be  respectful a=
nd clean,
though without being a freak about it and would  like to find someone simil=
ar. I
 rarely have guests over though I don't  mind an occasional dinner guest, o=
r visitor.
I like living here quite a  bit and am interested in finding someone who is=
 similarly
attracted to  the place.
I am looking to fill the apartment as soon as possible as my roommates  are=
 moving
on. For clarity's sake; it would be $950 (plus $950 security  deposit) for =
two the
rooms together. Those interested, please write back  with a little about yo=
urself,
(no novellas please:), and I will get  back to you shortly.

e 15=20
days more  in October), and I'm  open to either a studio or 1 bedroom of my=
 own,
 or my own room in a  shared apartment with one or two other people.
My philosophy as a roommate (which I have plenty of experience with - I  cu=
rrently
live in New York and before during the years, San Diego in  California in 2=
008)=20
is laid back, but I absolutely recognize the  necessity of paying rent on t=
ime.=20
I'm easy to get along with, but it's  important for me to have clean common=
 areas
(bathroom, kitchen, living  room). When I live by myself, I wash dishes dai=
ly and
clean my bathroom   every other week. I'm a non-smoker, no drugs, clean and=
 neat,
quiet,  flexible and drama free.
I am looking for someone who's mature and who want to keep a very serene en=
vironment.
Here are my criteria:
- Expenses included
- a decent-sized kitchen (I like to cook.)
- under $1200/month
- I don't mind if you have cats
- SAFE enough neighborhood that I can walk home from the subway after midni=
ght/early
mornings after a late or overnight shift.
If you can offer something that checks off most of those boxes, please get =
in touch!

$1800 per month, West Village, Greenwich Village, Chelsea, Soho,  Responsib=
le 30-something
professional looking for sublet (short or long  term)
Available: 08/28/2013 through 01/12/2013
Hello!  I am fulfilling one of my dreams and have finally managed to  secur=
e a transfer
from London to New York with my job.  I am so excited  about moving and am =
interested
in subletting while I get settled into my  new life in NYC.
I own my home in London and have decided to rent it out.  Therefore, I  can=
 appreciate
the worry about letting someone else be responsible for  your home while yo=
u are
 not in it!
I am a young professional, originally from Ireland but have been lucky  eno=
ugh to
live in France, Switzerland and Russia before spending 8 years  in London. =
 From
 each country I have lived, I have a piece of art as a  memento.  I find it=
's a=20
great way of cherishing my memories, experiences  and adventures from each =
place
 I have lived.
I am clean and tidy.  I enjoy the gym, socializing and travel.  I am  rubbi=
sh when
it comes to cooking so I tend to go to parties rather than  host them...  I=
 am always
out and about, therefore, my home tends to be  more of a refuge to escape t=
he City
rather than one of my social  corners.
I am looking for an apartment or room to sublet on a short or long term  ba=
sis (up
to one year).  A safe neighbourhood, a great building and good  storage are=
 also
 attributes I am after.  I have shared my home before  so that is also some=
thing
 I am very happy to consider.
I know Manhattan quite well and have family in Colorado so I won't be a tot=
al orphan.
If you have any questions please drop me a line.  Very happy to Skype or Fa=
ce Time
if that is easier.

LONDON, $1500 per month, East London, South London, or any edgy and  intere=
sting
 neighborhood, New to London from Williamsburg/Bushwick  Brooklyn, looking =
for apartment
share in similar kind of neighborhood in  London
Available: Starting Sept 1-13 through 6-12+ months
Hi. I just moved to London from New York and am living with friends  until =
their
 lease is up in mid-September. Before moving to London I was  living in Bus=
hwick
 and East Williamsburg in Brooklyn. I really enjoy and  feel most at home i=
n edgy,
emerging neighborhoods. I like the people,  the energy, the buildings, the =
bars=20
and shops. I'm thinking somewhere in  East London would be a good fit, but =
I don't
know London very well yet  and would definitely consider other neighborhood=
s that
fit that  description. I'd love to be able to walk to work if possible (I'm=
 a  lawyer
and work near Tower of London.) I'm looking to spend between  800-1000 poun=
ds per
month for an apartment share.
I'm friendly and easy going. I enjoy meeting new people. I like  independen=
t movies,
going out for drinks with friends, traveling (I'm  very excited about the t=
ravel
 opportunities from London!), and I'm  really into design and architecture,=
 especially
prefab architecture. I'm  very respectful of others' space and property. I =
enjoy
 hanging out with  roommates, but am also independent.
I'm looking to rent a room in an apartment share for 6-12 months or longer,=
 starting
any time between September 1-13.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Thanks!

$950 per month, Astoria/Sunnyside/Brooklyn/Wash  Heights/Inwood/Harlem...an=
y short
commute to midtown, Female grad  student seeks great room/roommates
Available: August 1/August 15/ Now
Hello all,
I am looking for a place to live starting August 1, or August 15, or  somew=
here=20
in between. If you have an asap situation, that could work  too.
I am open to various locations/boroughs, hoping to keep my rent between  $7=
00-950
(can be flexible with this if the right place comes along) and  my commute =
to school
(CUNY Graduate Journalism School, 40th St. between  7th and 8th Ave.) short=
 and=20
sweet.
I am a single, non-smoker with no pets, but I often love other people's  an=
imals,
so keep me in mind if that is your situation. However, I don't  do litter b=
ox duty.
I am kind, considerate and believe honesty is the best policy, so passive a=
ggressive
white-board notes are not my style.
I help keep common spaces clean because I relish roommate harmony and  like=
 a comfy
home, but my room will probably be in some disarray with  books, paper, clo=
thes.
 Nothing scarier than that, though.
I do not need to be grand friends with a roommate or roommates, but I  woul=
d say
 my ideal home is where tenants do their own thing/sometimes  come together=
/share
mutual respect/maybe have wild fun together (or  never)/the end. In other w=
ords,
 no pressure.
Also, I'm 28 and I eat meat sometimes, fish frequently, but obviously it is=
 okay
 if you don't.
Beyond this, ask my anything and I look forward to hearing from you!
I will be out and about looking at places and I do not have a  smartphone. =
If you
need to reach me quickly, calling or texting at  303-506-2470 is best.
Also: please feel free to forward this information on to others not  subscr=
ibed=20
to the listing. I would love to be settled before school  starts on August =
18th.
Thanks!

For Barter, Red Hook, Brooklyn, Live aboard a historic ship in exchange for=
 25hrs
of work/week
Bunks available aboard historic ship in exchange for 25 hours of work p/wk.
(PLEASE NOTE: These positions are only available in exchange for  housing, =
there
 is no money compensation involved. And applicants with  full-time, M-F job=
s most
likely won't work.)
Ahoy!
We're looking for talented, responsible, and eager additions to our crew  o=
f 5 (16
if you count the animals.). Yankee Ferry is an historic  ferryboat, 106 yea=
rs old,
now privately-owned, and in the process of  becoming a non-profit and a cor=
porate
"think tank" space (And who knows  what else..). We are now docked (permane=
ntly,
 we don't go out to sea) in  the historic waterfront neighborhood of Red Ho=
ok, Brooklyn,
a scenic  fifteen minute ferry ride from Manhattan.
Yankee is an old girl, so she requires lots of care, and in return she  pro=
vides
 us one of the richest experiences of our lives. A ship this  size (~150' f=
rom bow
to stern), made of wood and steel, and entirely  subject to the elements, i=
s always
needing, sometimes crucial, work and  attention. And now in our new in Red =
Hook=20
location, all new doorways are  presenting themselves to share Yankee with =
the community
and the world.  So there's lots of good work to do!
We're looking for the right pairs of fresh hands to join the adventure.
Needed roles are
1) A handy deckhand - carpentry, repair work, electric, plumbing,  welding,=
 etc.
 You don't need to be an expert, but you must at least be  familiar working=
 with
 tools and have the sensitivity and general  wherewithal of how things work=
 and=20
how to fix them. Boat experience is a  plus, but not necessary. Any other s=
kills
 or talents are all pluses  too.
2) A cleaning steward - Professional/real world experience is a big  plus. =
Someone
with a keen, detail-oriented eye, and who knows how to  deep clean, not jus=
t superficially.
Vacuuming, dusting, cleaning windows  and glassware, polishing brass, steel=
, copper,
and other materials,  washing carpets, scrubbing floors, organizing, etc.
3) A Marketing/Business Wizard. Yankee's costs to stay afloat are high,  an=
d there
is no multimillionaire benefactor paying the bills. Through a  myriad of ev=
ents,
 rental spaces, photo/film shoots, stay-aboard program,  and various other =
ways,
 Yankee earns her own income. We're looking for  someone to charge the busi=
ness=20
side of things. An ideas person, as well  as a get-it-done person. Someone =
that=20
can think creatively about new  directions, make it all work, and make it c=
ontinually
more productive  and efficient. Someone to crunch the numbers and keep impe=
ccable
 records. Tech savviness is a huge plus.
4) A Painter. We're looking for someone with an eye for detail, painting  e=
xperience,
and someone who is tidy and will clean up after a day of  work...including =
the brushes.
You will be working with shellac,  oil-based paints, varnish, and will pain=
t everything
from doors to  windows to staircases to the side of the ship (it's best if =
you don't
 have a fear of hanging off the side of a ship)
General mandatory requirements of our new crew members are:
1) Must be reliable and trustworthy -
We are all required to uphold our own integrity as part of this small  comm=
unity.
The requirement of this position is 25 hours of concentrated  and devoted w=
ork per
week. We must all know that we can count on each  other.
2) Respectful - to each other, to the rules, and most importantly to  Yanke=
e herself.
This isn't just a thrilling experience to tell our  friends about. This is =
being
 a part of something really special, so we  all must honor that, and respec=
t it.
3) Must be hungry - hungry to grow, hungry to create, contribute, and to  l=
earn.
 Again this is a fantastic endeavor, and it's only right that the  people w=
ho are
a part of it want to thrive in it.
So if you think you're up for the adventure, tell me! Who are you, what  ar=
e you
 good at, and what do you think of this opportunity?
I look forward to hearing from you.
Ahoy!

room. It does not  have a window to the outside though there are windows at=
 the top of the  wall allowing in natural light while preserving privacy.<b=
r /> <br /> The studios at Fowler are private and semi-private with communa=
l space  and a large gallery/ project space. Studios are housed on the seco=
nd  floor of the historic Greenpoint Terminal Market building. The building=
  is located at the corner of Noble and West St. about two blocks from the =
 Greenpoint Ave G stop on the waterfront. These studios are work-only  with=
 24-hour access, internet, elevator, north and south facing windows,  and a=
 great community of artists.<br /> <br /> Fowler offers communal facilities=
 such as hang-out areas, refrigerator,  microwave, bottled water, a chop sa=
w, and shared use of other tools and  equipment. Artists are able to partic=
ipate in annual open studios  events, and artists are also able to propose =
exhibitions to be  considered for the gallery.<br /> <br /> Check out this =

0 per month, Bedford Stuyvesant, 800 Sq Ft, Want to share creative space? C=
heck out the Pool-House workshop!<br /> Available: 8/1/13<br /><br /> WHAT =
IS IT?<br /> The Pool-House workshop is a small creative space and micro-wo=
rkshop in  the heart of Bedford-Stuyvesant. It's located ~3 blocks from the=
  Nostrand/Bedford G stop.<br /> <br /> It's roughly 800 sq feet. It has a =
front zone with space for light metal  or wood working, and a back zone wit=
h a mess sink, general workspace,  toilet area, couch (not next to toilet),=
 and a back yard. The efficacy  of the yard as a hangout-space is still to =
be determined.<br /> <br /> WHO ARE WE LOOKING FOR?<br /> We'd love to shar=
e the space with a few more folks who would be excited  to have a place to =
work on art, music, crafts, projects, or generally  need a space away from =
home to be creative.<br /> <br /> We're open to reconfiguring the space to =
best share it, depending on what you do.<br /> <br /> The neighbors upstair=
s generally don't mind noise during the day, but  after 8 or 9pm, we try to=
 keep it down. Loud instruments (drums, brass,  etc) wouldn't be optimal.<b=
r /> <br /> MONTHLY RENT<br /> The monthly rent on the space is flexible - =
we've listed $250 as a  starting point, but we'd try to come up with someth=
ing fair, probably  between $200 and $350, depending on your needs.<br /> <=
br /> WHO ELSE IS THERE?<br /> We are three friendly creative folks who are=
 looking for 1-3 additional space-mates.<br /> <br /> Jordan: She is a musi=
cian and founding member of the band, My Body. She  lives, works at a resta=
urant, and creates music in 3 separate locations  along the B38 bus line.<b=
r /> <br /> Darren: The other 1/2 of My Body and also 1/2 of the Mobile Poo=
l project  (google "Mobile Pool" and see the kickstarter page). A very frie=
ndly  & boisterous fellow.<br /> <br /> Dean: He's 1/2 of Mobile Pool and l=
ives 1/2 in Brooklyn and 1/2 in Providence, so he's merely 1/2 of a person.=
<br /> <br /> GET IN TOUCH!<br /> Please get in touch if you'd like to meet=
 us and check out the Pool-House workshop.<br /> <br /> See more photos at =

/> The Bakery is a coworking space founded in 2013 by Jason Kachadourian an=
d Asa Pingree. <br /> <br /> Like most big projects, it started out with ta=
lk of getting a small  space, a shop in which to make furniture collaborati=
vely. Both founders  connected over a shared interest in furniture, and hav=
e worked in  numerous fields and disciplines; as the project grew, the two =
realized  that there was no reason to limit their range of interests, and b=
ecame  interested in adding collaborators.<br /> <br /> The Bakery was then=
 created for people like Jason and Asa: trained in  the arts, and working i=
n New York, across a variety of processes. The  resulting space, organized =
in a former kosher bakery, features a series  of six small studios, about a=
 dozen desk spaces, and a spacious communal  room that can be used for meet=
ings, photoshoots, project planning, or  sharing an XXL order of enchiladas=
 from Mexico 2000. <br /> <br /> There is also limited access to a fully-eq=
uipped woodshop and a roof  garden. A small storefront will serve as a show=
case for the space,  featuring projects from Bakery members, as well as gue=
st curators and  organizers.<br /> <br /> We have been carefully selecting =
our new studio mates and, as of the end  of July, most of the studio spaces=
 have been filled. We are now  conducting interviews with people looking fo=
r desk space.<br /><br /> <a style=3D"color: black;" shape=3D"rect" href=3D=

m a laid-back 27 year-old grad student and teacher. I like  to use the apar=

ce a month, at least in the summer, which is always  subject to roommate ap=
proval. I'm queer-identified and female. Enjoy  cooking when I have time. <=
br /> <br /> What I'm looking for: A roommate who is communicative and cons=
cientious.  I have a 3-year old pit mix who is very lovable and also, hyper=
, so I  need someone who enjoys having a dog around. Would consider someone=
 with  a dog if their dog got along with mine and we could help each other =
out  with dog care. I'd prefer someone who was also a grad student or had a=
  full-time job. <br /> <br /> About the neighborhood: The apartment is clo=
se to Associated (a great  grocery store), Northeast Kingdom (restaurant), =
Cobra Club (bar), Hana  Foods (organic grocery store), shops at the Loom (y=
oga studio, cafe,  co-op), laundromats, bodegas, and many other great thing=

0 per month, Astoria, Huge girls apartment<br /> Available: Sept 1, 2013 th=
rough Sept 1, 2014<br /><br /> Hi,<br /> I'm looking for 2-3 female roommat=
es for a year lease starting on September 1st. <br /> <br /> The place is h=
uge and there is even a sun room. The rent ranges from  $600-700 based on t=
he size of your room. Also, it's been passed down  over the years so it's p=
retty furnished-and the current tenants may be  willing to sell some of the=
ir furniture.<br /> <br /> The neighborhood is affordable and great. It has=
 every kind of food  (Greek, Italian, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Aus=
tralian,  Mexican...). Plus, the apartment is only a few blocks from Single=
 Cut  Brewery (they're a bit hoppy for me, but good local beer never hurts)=
.<br /> <br /> About me: I am friendly, busy, open-minded, and clean. I wor=
k for a  magazine and I am a full time graduate journalism student. My stan=
dards  are: respectful, responsible, and able to pay the rent. It is import=
ant  to me that the public area stays clean and friendly. Good people &  go=
od vibes are welcome. <br /> <br /> I love pets (but you have to negotiate =
with the landlord). <br /> <br /> Feel free to contact me if you have quest=
ions or to request more info.<br /><br /> <a style=3D"color: black;" shape=

8 per month, Bed-Stuy/Bushwick, 1 Private Bedroom with window and spacious =
closet<br /> Available: 8/1/2013 through 1/31/14<br /><br /> 1 bedroom for =
1 person available starting August 1st! The room has a  window and your own=
 closet, with shelves. It's not huge, but it's not a  closet (I know becaus=
e I've lived in one), and it's a good deal when a  lot of stuff in the area=
 is starting to get more expensive. The  apartment is on the second floor o=
f a small building which is only 3  blocks away from the J/M stop at Myrtle=
/Broadway. 4 or 5 blocks to J at  Kosciuszko. Every room in the apartment h=
as windows, big tall ones, so  lots of natural light, which is one of my fa=
vorite things about the  place. Also there's fire escape access from kitche=
n. Roommate should  ideally have a job or some kind of project going on to =
occupy their  time. Whatever you do is cool, as long as it's not hanging ar=
ound the  house watching Netflix. That said, I don't care how you make your=
 money,  as long as you pay before the 1st of each month. Guarantor signatu=
re  may be required if no proof of income can be provided.<br /> <br /> I a=
m an artist who works at an art magazine and also helps run a zine  library=
 in the neighborhood. I spend a lot of time in my room quietly  working on =
my own projects or doing freelance work. Since I work from  home, ideally I=
'd like someone who works out of the house. Looking for  someone responsibl=
e, clean, and generally cheerful who likes to keep  their apartment as thei=
r place to come home to, away from the craziness  of the city. Overnight gu=
ests fine, some people are a little controlling  on this issue, but you're =
an adult (hopefully) and should do as you  please provided you're considera=
te. No Pets.<br /> <br /> Utilities are electricity, gas, and internet (hea=
t+hot water is covered  by landlord), and run to at most $50 per person per=
 month, usually less.  Security deposit the same amount as one month's rent=
 is due upon  move-in, which will be returned to you upon move out provided=
 you leave  the room/apartment as you found it. Recycling is a must here, I=
 make it  very simple and easy to follow. You should contribute to apartmen=
t  expenses as necessary (toilet paper, dish soap, etc.), clean up after  y=
ourself, and occasionally sweep as needed. This is a nice apartment,  defin=
itely what you make of it!<br /><br /> <a style=3D"color: black;" shape=3D"=

 roof access and one of  the best views I've seen in Brooklyn!<br /><br /> =

 I'm looking for a roommate (preferably female) to live in 1 furnished  bed=
room in a 2 bedroom/ 1 bathroom apartment. Rent per month is $780  plus uti=
lities $60 (internet, gas, electricity). The room is already  furnished wit=
h a futon bed and a couple of other shelving/drawer pieces.  The apartment =
is 1/2 a block from the Montrose stop on the L. There's a  24 hour grocery =
store one block away. Laundry is also one block away  (and they do drop-off=
 service). There are several great bars,  restaurants, and shops in the are=
a.<br /> <br /> There is a big closet in the bedroom and there are two wind=
ows that open  to the inside of the apartment. The room is long and narrow =
but it is  quite cozy and thankfully there are very high ceilings. The AC i=
s in the  kitchen, so that does well to cool the bedroom. There is a tiny l=
iving  room between the two bedrooms with a sleeper sofa and a large flat  =
screen tv.<br /> <br /> A little bit about me: I am 28 yr old female that m=
anages the art  gallery at an art school during the day and paints weeknigh=
ts/weekends  at my art studio. If I am not at work or in my studio, then I =
am out at  art openings, with friends, etc. so I am not home that much. On =
 occasion, I like having a couple of friends over, and I would be happy  fo=
r you to have you friends over, too! When I am home, I'm pretty quiet  beca=
use I am usually home to just sleep these days, and I really like to  keep =
things neat and CLEAN. (I understand, we all make messes, but  there's a di=
fference between messy and dirty.) I don't have any pets,  and I don't smok=
e so I prefer to keep it that way inside the apartment.<br /> <br /> Please=
 say a bit about yourself and how long you would plan on staying.  One mont=
h's rent plus one month's security required to stay.<br /><br /> <a style=

r /> The neighborhood is terrific. Five minutes one direction takes you to =
 the bucolic East River walk and every other direction takes you to  cafes,=
 restaurants, shops and bars or Tompkins Square Park.<br /> <br /> The apar=
tment is clean, breezy and well maintained, has washer/dryer and  dishwashe=

 well stocked, with a central island and open floor plan  to the living roo=

 square feet!) 11.9 X  20'. The $1900 room is located at the rear of the bu=
ilding, overlooking  private, well-planted gardens. This room has one 5-foo=

 15' of hanging  space as well as shelves above. It shares the floor with t=
he other  bedroom, laundry room and full bath with tub.<br /> <br /> The se=
cond available room ($1750) faces 11th street and gets sun  throughout the =
day and, due to position on the 3rd floor, street noise  is minimized. As w=

n additional closet on the floor, outside the room,  with storage shelves a=
vailable for use.<br /> <br /> My housemate and her daughter are only leavi=

50 per month, Brooklyn Heights, Spacious, sunny room in lovely Brooklyn Hei=
ghts brownstone apartment<br /> Available: 08/05/13<br /><br /> I am giving=
 up a fantastic room in Brooklyn Heights to move abroad so  the search is o=
n for a new roommate to take over my gorgeous room in a  Brooklyn Heights b=
rownstone apartment.<br /> <br /> The room is very large and private with h=
ardwood floors. It has two big  street-facing windows that overlook a quain=
t, quiet tree-lined street  and let in lots of natural light. There are two=
 small closets as well as  one large closet area with built-in shelf space.=
 I very comfortably fit  a full-sized bed, desk, small couch, two end table=
s, and bookshelf in  the room. Plus, a non-working fireplace gives the room=
 a lot of  character. <br /> <br /> The apartment takes up the entire third=
 floor of a lovely, secure  brownstone. It is spacious and clean with a sha=
red living/dining room  and kitchen area, all with exposed brick. Three oth=
er roommates (2 girls  and 1 guy) in their late 20s-early 30s also live in =
the apartment. They  are all very cool, respectful and wonderful people to =
live with. The  first girl is from Michigan and works in costume design for=
 theater. The  second girl is from Maine and a teacher at a nearby private =
school. The  guy is from Ohio and just finished his masters in Economics. A=
ll have  lived in the city for 5+ years and have active, busy lives outside=
 the  apartment but we occasionally chat over food or go out together. <br =
/> <br /> The apartment is located on Henry Street, which is peaceful and s=
afe  with gorgeous brownstones and tons of cafes, bars, shops and grocery  =
stores nearby, including Trader Joes! It is conveniently just a few  blocks=
 from the Borough Hall 2/3/4/5 and Court Street R stops, and a  short walk =
from the Jay Street A/C/F stop. The Brooklyn Heights  Promenade is about a =
five-minute walk away.<br /> <br /> In terms of roommate criteria, I'd love=
 to find a nice, clean and  respectful person who will fit in well with my =
friendly roommates in  this lovely home. They are looking for a roommate wh=
o wants to make the  apartment their home and ensure it is a quiet oasis fr=
om the city,  especially on weeknights. <br /> <br /> You should be able to=
 commit to a full year lease that would begin  September 1st and be employe=
d full-time. Full-time graduate students  will also be considered. Candidat=
es should be non-smokers, in the  similar age range as current roommates, a=
nd willing to pitch in to keep  the common spaces clean. There is no TV in =
the common area, but I did  keep one in my room. <br /> <br /> Rent is $1,4=
50.00 per month with heat included. We split the other utilities like elect=
ricity and internet. <br /> <br /> Move-in is preferably early to mid Augus=
t. Also, to move in you will need to:<br /> -=09Get a basic credit check do=
ne by our management company which costs $ 75.00<br /> -=09Sign a one-year =
lease starting September 1st with the three other roommates in the apartmen=
t<br /> -=09Pay a security deposit of $2,400.00 directly to the management =
company, which is refunded when you move out. <br /> <br /> Note: the room =
can come furnished or unfurnished, as I am looking to sell my queen bed, de=
sk, small couch and large-screen TV.<br /> <br /> Please get in touch if yo=
u're interested, and tell us a bit about yourself!<br /><br /> Local Transp=
ortation: Borough Hall 2/3/4/5 and Court St R trains within a few blocks<br=

0 per month, Midwood, Conscious Supportive Community<br /> Available: septe=
mber 1 st<br /><br /> For many years now, I've been wanting to live in a ve=
ry particular kind  of community with other like minded individuals who are=
 deeply committed  to individual and collective development and awakening, =
supporting one  another, and collaboratively creating something together th=
at has the  potential to uplift, enrich and inspire us all.<br /> <br /> Ab=
out three days ago I found this beautiful giant Victorian mansion in  Midwo=
od Brooklyn, a few stops off the Q/B from Prospect Park. The  neighborhood =
is amazing, so quite and peaceful it feels almost like your  upstate.  And =
the house itself is Amazing! It's so big and spacious and  has a very energ=
etically open, circular spiraling upward feel.  All of  the rooms are reall=
y, really big and the largest one, which is still  available, is gigantic. =
There's an outdoor area, a 2-car garage with  driveway, a fireplace, huge l=
iving room and dinning room and it even has  a Jacuzzi on the 3rd floor. <b=
r /> <br /> We are now in the final process of putting our group together a=
nd so far  we have a pretty amazing group with a balanced mix of men and wo=
men  relatively diverse ages twenties to forties with one or two large and =
 smaller bedrooms left.<br /> <br /> We are ourselves, and are looking for =
others who consider themselves on a  spiritual path, who have a deep spirit=
ual practice and who are  committed to there own development not just limit=
ed to spirituality but  other areas of development including emotional, psy=
chological, and  interpersonal, communicative etc.!<br /> <br /> It really =
excited us to think about living with other meditators, yogis,  and other s=
piritual aspirants of all kinds who are also able to sustain  and support t=
hemselves financially and who are really interested in  living together, su=
pporting one another, collaboratively developing and  exploring new ways of=
 interacting, solving problems, relating in more  and more genuine and auth=
entic ways, while deepening and growing and  Together creating a home that =
can also really elevate and inspire all of  us beyond any of our wildest dr=
eams.<br /> <br /> We're still in the process of trying to figure out the b=
reakdown of the  rooms and the exact prices we have are range from smaller =
rooms around  $700-750 and others upward from there including the largest t=
hat is  seriously the size of a big studio that we're thinking would be gre=
at  for a couple depending on the breakdown around $1100-1300, an amazing  =
deal either way.<br /> <br /> Details:<br /> The move in date will be Septe=
mber 1st 2013 and we will be submitting an application within the next day =
or so.<br /> To move in each roommate needs to have first months rent, a se=
curity  deposit and we have to pay a brokers fee. All in the amount of rent=
 that  person will be paying for his/her room.  Example: rent $750 need to =
 have 3x$750 =3D $2250 and be able to show with tax records, w-2, past pay =
 stubs etc. that you will be able to cover your share of the rent moving  f=
orward.<br /> <br /> Planning to show the house and get everyone together t=
oday, tonight,  tomorrow and it's a bit fast paced need to have our crew to=
gether to  submit the application.<br /> <br /> If your reading this and it=
 sounds like something you'd be into please  give me a call or email me. We=
lcome to share a little bit about yourself  and leave your telephone number=
 so we can speak in person!<br /> <br /> Ok! Thank You!...look forward to h=
earing from you!...and many blessings on your journey! Love and Light!<br /=

o not ask.  <br /> <br /> The rooms both receive a good amount of natural l=
ight , and the larger  room has a medium size bay window. The larger room m=
akes a perfect  studio space for being so spacious; the ceiling height in b=
oth are  roughly 12'. For those interested in a live/ work this is pretty i=
deal.<br /> <br /> You would be sharing the rest of the apartment (sunny ki=
tchen, medium  sized living room, and a bathroom) with one other roommate; =
myself.  There are plenty of little closets and extra storage spaces which =
are  one of my personal favorite features about this apartment, in addition=
  to the natural light. The apartment is within a quick walk to the Myrtle =
 Wyckoff station (on the L and M lines), though it is also far enough  that=
 it isn't an aural burden.  A lot of families reside here in the  neighborh=
ood, so there is a real domestic, and tranquil air to the  street by compar=
ison with other streets here in Bushwick. And, of  course, there are ample =
delis, bodegas, restaurants, and cafes nearby.  Utilities and internet gene=
rally run about $60 per month.<br /> <br /> I'm in my mid 30's, and a paint=
er; who is interested in keeping a clean,  quiet, cozy apartment as a funct=
ional nest. I consider myself to be  respectful and clean, though without b=
eing a freak about it and would  like to find someone similar. I rarely hav=
e guests over though I don't  mind an occasional dinner guest, or visitor. =
I like living here quite a  bit and am interested in finding someone who is=
 similarly attracted to  the place. <br /> <br /> I am looking to fill the =
apartment as soon as possible as my roommates  are moving on. For clarity's=
 sake; it would be $950 (plus $950 security  deposit) for two the rooms tog=
ether. Those interested, please write back  with a little about yourself, (=
no novellas please:), and I will get  back to you shortly.<br /><br /> <a s=

ng renovating this week in our  three story, three unit house off the Dekal=
b Stop. Each floor is 1200 sq  feet with four bedrooms- 2 large/2 smaller. =
Each bedroom has a real  window, the apts can be configured in many differe=

 living room/guest  room/etc..<br /> <br /> We have restored the original o=
ak flooring, brought back most of the  details and installed new kitchens. =
Ceilings are 10ft high and there is a  stairwell to the roof, which has an =
incredible view of Manhattan. We  are going to live on the first floor and =
are putting a lot of thought  and energy into everything from the hall ligh=
ts to the plants in the  backyard. <br /> <br /> The house is located 4 blo=
cks from the L Train Dekalb stop off St.  Nicholas Avenue (and 5 blocks fro=
m the M Train Myrtle stop) on a quiet,  tree-lined street. We are 8 blocks =
from the Jefferson stop, our main  source of really cool bars and restauran=
ts and excellent coffee. <br /> <br /> Price for two tenants is $2500/mo wh=
ile 3 to 4 tenants the rent must be  $2700. There is no broker fee, but we =
will need first and last months  rent as well as a short description of you=
rselves/renting history.  Referrals and/or guarantors would be great.<br />=
 <br /> The apartments are not finished at present but will be by August 1s=
t,  which is why we don't have many photos and I tried to avoid shooting th=
e  floors (which are getting sanded right now!). We are happy to start  sho=
wing this week while work is ongoing.<br /><br /> <a style=3D"color: black;=

 September 2013 (and possibly until the middle of October 2013) to  do rese=
arch at Queens College of NY. I'm looking for a place to live  during the m=

 a studio or 1 bedroom of my own, or my own room in a  shared apartment wit=
h one or two other people. <br /> <br /> My philosophy as a roommate (which=
 I have plenty of experience with - I  currently live in New York and befor=
e during the years, San Diego in  California in 2008) is laid back, but I a=
bsolutely recognize the  necessity of paying rent on time. I'm easy to get =
along with, but it's  important for me to have clean common areas (bathroom=
, kitchen, living  room). When I live by myself, I wash dishes daily and cl=
ean my bathroom   every other week. I'm a non-smoker, no drugs, clean and n=
eat, quiet,  flexible and drama free.<br /> I am looking for someone who's =
mature and who want to keep a very serene environment.<br /> <br /> Here ar=
e my criteria:<br /> - Expenses included<br /> - a decent-sized kitchen (I =
like to cook.)<br /> - under $1200/month<br /> - I don't mind if you have c=

one of my dreams and have finally managed to  secure a transfer from London=
 to New York with my job.  I am so excited  about moving and am interested =
in subletting while I get settled into my  new life in NYC.  <br /> <br /> =
I own my home in London and have decided to rent it out.  Therefore, I  can=
 appreciate the worry about letting someone else be responsible for  your h=
ome while you are not in it!  <br /> <br /> I am a young professional, orig=
inally from Ireland but have been lucky  enough to live in France, Switzerl=
and and Russia before spending 8 years  in London.  From each country I hav=
e lived, I have a piece of art as a  memento.  I find it's a great way of c=
herishing my memories, experiences  and adventures from each place I have l=
ived.<br /> <br /> I am clean and tidy.  I enjoy the gym, socializing and t=
ravel.  I am  rubbish when it comes to cooking so I tend to go to parties r=
ather than  host them...  I am always out and about, therefore, my home ten=
ds to be  more of a refuge to escape the City rather than one of my social =
 corners.<br /> <br /> I am looking for an apartment or room to sublet on a=
 short or long term  basis (up to one year).  A safe neighbourhood, a great=
 building and good  storage are also attributes I am after.  I have shared =
my home before  so that is also something I am very happy to consider.  <br=
 /> <br /> I know Manhattan quite well and have family in Colorado so I won=
't be a total orphan.<br /> <br /> If you have any questions please drop me=
 a line.  Very happy to Skype or Face Time if that is easier.<br /><br /> <=

e bars and shops. I'm thinking somewhere in  East London would be a good fi=
t, but I don't know London very well yet  and would definitely consider oth=
er neighborhoods that fit that  description. I'd love to be able to walk to=
 work if possible (I'm a  lawyer and work near Tower of London.) I'm lookin=
g to spend between  800-1000 pounds per month for an apartment share.<br />=
 <br /> I'm friendly and easy going. I enjoy meeting new people. I like  in=
dependent movies, going out for drinks with friends, traveling (I'm  very e=
xcited about the travel opportunities from London!), and I'm  really into d=
esign and architecture, especially prefab architecture. I'm  very respectfu=
l of others' space and property. I enjoy hanging out with  roommates, but a=
m also independent.<br /> <br /> I'm looking to rent a room in an apartment=
 share for 6-12 months or longer, starting any time between September 1-13.=
<br /> <br /> I look forward to hearing from you.<br /> <br /> Thanks!<br /=

 /> Available: August 1/August 15/ Now<br /><br /> Hello all, <br /> <br />=
 I am looking for a place to live starting August 1, or August 15, or  some=
where in between. If you have an asap situation, that could work  too. <br =
/> <br /> I am open to various locations/boroughs, hoping to keep my rent b=
etween  $700-950 (can be flexible with this if the right place comes along)=
 and  my commute to school (CUNY Graduate Journalism School, 40th St. betwe=
en  7th and 8th Ave.) short and sweet. <br /> <br /> I am a single, non-smo=
ker with no pets, but I often love other people's  animals, so keep me in m=
ind if that is your situation. However, I don't  do litter box duty.<br /> =
<br /> I am kind, considerate and believe honesty is the best policy, so pa=
ssive aggressive white-board notes are not my style. <br /> <br /> I help k=
eep common spaces clean because I relish roommate harmony and  like a comfy=
 home, but my room will probably be in some disarray with  books, paper, cl=
othes. Nothing scarier than that, though. <br /> <br /> I do not need to be=
 grand friends with a roommate or roommates, but I  would say my ideal home=
 is where tenants do their own thing/sometimes  come together/share mutual =
respect/maybe have wild fun together (or  never)/the end. In other words, n=
o pressure. <br /> <br /> Also, I'm 28 and I eat meat sometimes, fish frequ=
ently, but obviously it is okay if you don't. <br /> <br /> Beyond this, as=
k my anything and I look forward to hearing from you!<br /> <br /> I will b=
e out and about looking at places and I do not have a  smartphone. If you n=
eed to reach me quickly, calling or texting at  303-506-2470 is best. <br /=
> <br /> Also: please feel free to forward this information on to others no=
t  subscribed to the listing. I would love to be settled before school  sta=

 Barter, Red Hook, Brooklyn, Live aboard a historic ship in exchange for 25=
hrs of work/week<br /> <br /><br /> Bunks available aboard historic ship in=
 exchange for 25 hours of work p/wk.<br /> <br /> (PLEASE NOTE: These posit=
ions are only available in exchange for  housing, there is no money compens=
ation involved. And applicants with  full-time, M-F jobs most likely won't =
work.)<br /> <br /> Ahoy!<br /> <br /> We're looking for talented, responsi=
ble, and eager additions to our crew  of 5 (16 if you count the animals.). =
Yankee Ferry is an historic  ferryboat, 106 years old, now privately-owned,=
 and in the process of  becoming a non-profit and a corporate "think tank" =
space (And who knows  what else..). We are now docked (permanently, we don'=
t go out to sea) in  the historic waterfront neighborhood of Red Hook, Broo=
klyn, a scenic  fifteen minute ferry ride from Manhattan. <br /> <br /> Yan=
kee is an old girl, so she requires lots of care, and in return she  provid=
es us one of the richest experiences of our lives. A ship this  size (~150'=
 from bow to stern), made of wood and steel, and entirely  subject to the e=
lements, is always needing, sometimes crucial, work and  attention. And now=
 in our new in Red Hook location, all new doorways are  presenting themselv=
es to share Yankee with the community and the world.  So there's lots of go=
od work to do!<br /> <br /> We're looking for the right pairs of fresh hand=
s to join the adventure. <br /> <br /> Needed roles are<br /> 1) A handy de=
ckhand - carpentry, repair work, electric, plumbing,  welding, etc. You don=
't need to be an expert, but you must at least be  familiar working with to=
ols and have the sensitivity and general  wherewithal of how things work an=
d how to fix them. Boat experience is a  plus, but not necessary. Any other=
 skills or talents are all pluses  too.<br /> <br /> 2) A cleaning steward =
- Professional/real world experience is a big  plus. Someone with a keen, d=
etail-oriented eye, and who knows how to  deep clean, not just superficiall=
y. Vacuuming, dusting, cleaning windows  and glassware, polishing brass, st=
eel, copper, and other materials,  washing carpets, scrubbing floors, organ=
izing, etc.<br /> <br /> 3) A Marketing/Business Wizard. Yankee's costs to =
stay afloat are high,  and there is no multimillionaire benefactor paying t=
he bills. Through a  myriad of events, rental spaces, photo/film shoots, st=
ay-aboard program,  and various other ways, Yankee earns her own income. We=
're looking for  someone to charge the business side of things. An ideas pe=
rson, as well  as a get-it-done person. Someone that can think creatively a=
bout new  directions, make it all work, and make it continually more produc=
tive  and efficient. Someone to crunch the numbers and keep impeccable  rec=
ords. Tech savviness is a huge plus.<br /> <br /> 4) A Painter. We're looki=
ng for someone with an eye for detail, painting  experience, and someone wh=
o is tidy and will clean up after a day of  work...including the brushes. Y=
ou will be working with shellac,  oil-based paints, varnish, and will paint=
 everything from doors to  windows to staircases to the side of the ship (i=
t's best if you don't  have a fear of hanging off the side of a ship)<br />=
 <br /> General mandatory requirements of our new crew members are: <br /> =
1) Must be reliable and trustworthy - <br /> We are all required to uphold =
our own integrity as part of this small  community. The requirement of this=
 position is 25 hours of concentrated  and devoted work per week. We must a=
ll know that we can count on each  other.<br /> 2) Respectful - to each oth=
er, to the rules, and most importantly to  Yankee herself. This isn't just =
a thrilling experience to tell our  friends about. This is being a part of =
something really special, so we  all must honor that, and respect it. <br /=
> 3) Must be hungry - hungry to grow, hungry to create, contribute, and to =
 learn. Again this is a fantastic endeavor, and it's only right that the  p=
eople who are a part of it want to thrive in it. <br /> <br /> So if you th=
ink you're up for the adventure, tell me! Who are you, what  are you good a=
t, and what do you think of this opportunity?<br /> <br /> I look forward t=
o hearing from you. <br /> <br /> Ahoy!<br /><br /> <a style=3D"color: blac=
