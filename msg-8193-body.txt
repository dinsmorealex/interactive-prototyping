For those not familiar with the area, it&#39;s generally thought of as a =
safe, quiet Brooklyn neighborhood. The building is just a few blocks from=
 the G train, with plenty of food options and easy street parking.

I have had my own art studio in this building for almost 4 years, and the=
 management has asked me to help get interest in the new spaces as they a=
re expanding the number of studios in the building. I will be the one sho=
wing the spaces and there are absolutely NO fees involved.

If you&#39;re interested, please text Jordan. I look forward to hearing f=
rom you. Thanks!

I am a figurative oil painter in a studio space divided into six units.  =
I have a space with a door that closes but you walk through two other stu=
dios to get to it. I generally use the studio in the afternoon and am loo=
king for someone who might want to use the studio in the morning or later=
 in the evening (open to having different days or dividing up the time ot=
her ways).  One wall has a big pane glass window, and there are two long =
walls and one shorter wall.  Would like someone who is neat and doesn&#39=
;t use toxic or smelly solvents. The rules of the space are to take cell =
phone calls in the hall and listen to music with headphones only.  Would =
like at least a 6 month commitment. Shared slop sink is in the space but =
if want hot water you have to use the bathroom sinks in the bathroom down=
 the hall. Great Vietnamese restaurant half block away and a Western Beef=
.

$489.00 Per Month, Union Sq., New York, Lovely Union Sq. Studio Share
Available: Nov 15, 2014

We are two costume designers now looking for someone to take the third sp=
ot in our lovely Union Square studio, as our last studiomate has outgrown=
 the space. The new person will have the nice third corner by the window =
and will pay $489/month (a third of the total cost) within a 14&#39;x17&#=
39; studio. Here&#39;s some info on the space:

-Right on Union Square, an amazing location, with the farmer&#39;s market=
 4 days/week right out the front door
-7th floor with windows on two sides of the room - one facing a nice skyl=
ine, the other facing an amazing view of never-ending fire escapes
-24/7 access
-Heat, A/C, electric included
-A slop sink and mini-fridge in the room
-4 wall-mounted shelves that are 4&#39; long reserved for you, sturdy eno=
ugh for books
-Newly renovated bathrooms on the floor
-Wifi already installed for an additional $20/month
-Amazing studio-mates, both costume designers, with one often out of town=
 (so the studio is rarely full)
-Really great building staff - the super is on our floor and very nice an=
d helpful
-Building mostly filled with artists so everyone is pretty friendly

The space is a little tight for a set designer, but would be great for a =
costume, lighting or sound designer, or a director or writer, or anyone e=
lse that mostly uses a desk space/shelving. There are occasionally meetin=
gs in the space, and we would love to share the space with someone that w=
as open to being slightly communal. Also, we are in the process of puttin=
g in laminate wood flooring, and repainting--so the photo is not quite ac=
curate, since we have had to move things around--please come by to view.

Sunny, windowed space available in one of the most well known artist buil=
dings in Bushwick, 17-17 Troutman St. The building is currently full with=
 a waiting list. We spent months whitewashing and setting up the studio w=
ith plenty of lights, electrical outlets, and a $4,000 ventilated spray/c=
asting/dust booth in the center. You will not find a similar space in the=
 neighborhood.

Available studio:=20
The entire 2,500-square-foot room is divided into four studios. The space=
 for rent is the front, right-hand corner in the panoramic photo.  The sp=
ace currently has a translucent partition wall.

$675 with some paintings stored in the space; $775 without.

Other details:=20
--There are partial dividers to maintain an open feel and allow abundant =
natural light to pass. There is an 8&#39;x12&#39; translucent partition s=
eparating your space from the next.

The building and neighborhood:=20
Our building and its occupants have been written up in many art publicati=

unity full of creatives ranging from furniture designers and fabricators,=
 to artists who exhibit in Chelsea and internationally. The neighborhood =
is exploding with new stores, bars, restaurants, and more.

Us:=20
It is a quiet studio; everyone has different schedules and it is rare tha=

nd relaxed group who have known each other for years, looking for a serio=
us and considerate artist to join us. We are a mix of sculptors and paint=

$700.00 Per Month, Bushwick, Brooklyn, 480 sq. ft., Sunny Studio with Win=
dows and Inspiring View
Available: Dec 01, 2014 through Jun 30, 2015

Beautiful wall-of-windows studio with view and light in a great studio bu=
ilding.
 =20
I will be using my studio very sparingly over the next 8 months or more -=
mostly just for storage, and I am seeking someone who would like to share=
 the space with me. There is also the possibility to stay on after 6 mont=
hs, when I am back in there more regularly, if we both decide that would =
work. The timeframe of the share has some flexibility as to when it begin=
s and ends, so if you have specific parameters, please let me know and I =
may be able to work with that. I am open to discussing the possibility of=
 a month to month sublet as well.
=20
Most of my belongings will be stored behind a sliding wall, so they will =
be out of sight. I will retain one corner of the studio with a work table=
 and some power tools stored underneath it and may come in occasionally t=
o do some work, although it is unlikely.
=20
Your portion would be 325sf of the 480sf.=20
Your portion of the rent is $700 plus utilities (which tend to be low.). =
You will have the place to yourself 99% of the time as I will be using it=
 primarily as a storage only.=20
The building has a 24 hr freight elevator and gated driveway for easy unl=
oading. The space has its own heater and thermostat and is completely pri=
vate and secure.

If we decide to share the space after 6 months, it will be divided evenly=
 and your rent will go down to reflect that.=20
Month to month lease options will be considered.
117 Grattan is a large studio building with mostly art studios and small =
businesses. The closest subway is the Morgan Ave L.=20
I am looking for someone who is responsible and courteous and who will be=
 respectful of the space.=20
No band practice inquiries please.=20

Also, please note, there is no internet here currently. I bring my mobile=
 hotspot when I come here to do work which requires internet connection.=20=

Thanks,
Danielle

We are 2 females and 1 male all in late twenties interested in collective=

ilding, and the arts. Our interests and professions span many roles: educ=
ator, a bluegrass musician,affordable housing project manager, social wor=
ker, anti-racist organizer, artists, mean spaghetti cooker, hammock enthu=
siast explorer, biker. We enjoy dance parties over dinner prep, late nigh=
t art and music projects, sharing stories, and concocting city adventures=

 We all work hard and want to make sure our space is joyful, filled with =

$1,150.00 Per Month, S. Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 200 sq. ft., Charming Roo=
m in Bright and Sunny Williamsburg Apt - Dec 1
Available: Dec 01, 2014

I have a room available for rent starting Dec 1, in a creative, queer-fri=
endly, quiet, clean, chill and conveniently-located living environment.

The unfurnished medium-sized room (roughly 12 x12&#39;) easily fits a que=
en sized bed and is available for short-term and long-term rental. The ap=
artment is a bright, charming and roomy spot in South Williamsburg - a sh=
ort stroll from the Bedford L and Marcy JMZ stops. There&#39;s a large an=
d airy kitchen and a large bathroom that are shared and furnished.

I am a female designer/ceramicist in my early 30s, seeking a kind &amp; s=
imilarly creative roommate who has an active work and social life outside=
 the apartment and is in their late 20s/ early 30s. It&#39;s an ideal spo=
t for someone interested in a chill spot away from the fray but close eno=
ugh to jump in when you feel so inclined. Partiers, smokers and folks wit=
h live-in significant others would not be a good fit.

Rent is $1,150 and utilities come to about $50 a month including internet=
, gas and electricity, but it varies depending on the season. Heat is inc=
luded. No lease signing is required, but I do ask for a security deposit =
of one month&#39;s rent prior to moving in.

Too good to be true?! There ARE a couple of catches (sorry!): No couples,=
 smoking and pets (I occasionally dog sit for a small dog, so please be m=
utt friendly).

Please write back and share a bit about yourself if you&#39;re interested=
! Social links (instagram, facebook, linkedin, etc) will be dually apprec=
iated!

$850.00 Per Month, Bed Stuy, Brooklyn, 90 sq. ft., Bright room in spaciou=
s duplex with roofdeck available immediately!
Available: Nov 10, 2014

We have one room available in a 4-bedroom apartment available immediately=
! The room is about 8x10 with vaulted ceilings, a large closet, and overh=
ead storage space. It comes with an air conditioning unit (not that you&#=
39;ll need it in a few months, but whatever), and three really cool roomm=
ates.

The apartment is a third-floor walk-up duplex, meaning we&#39;ve got more=
 space than we know what to do with sometimes. The first floor has the co=
mmon areas and three of the four bedrooms, including kitchen, living room=
, and bathroom. We have a balcony off the front of the apartment overlook=
ing the street. The second floor is the fourth bedroom and what I&#39;d c=
all a pretty spectacular roof deck. You can see the empire state building=
! We have (dead) plants! And deck furniture! Come be a lizard and sun you=
rself. Although maybe not right now since it&#39;s getting kind of cold. =
But come summer, sure, go sun yourself. Or sun yourself now. We don&#39;t=
 judge.

We&#39;re a block from the Myrtle-Willoughby G train, and you can get int=
o Union Square in about 25 minutes during rush hour. There&#39;s also the=
 J/M about a 10 minute walk away.

Bills vary from season to season but average about $75 a month, and inclu=
de gas, electric and cable/internet.=20

About Us:

We are three 20-somethings in various states of adulthood who share a liv=
ing space and are friendly with one another. Clayton is a freelance video=
 editor and has lived in the place since January of 2012. Travis is a stu=
dent at the New School, part-time funny man, and has lived here since Aug=
ust. Sara is a web developer and has lived in the apartment since Decembe=
r 2011. Olivia is 8 and doesn&#39;t have a job because she&#39;s a cat. P=
fft, freeloader.=20

We&#39;re pretty chill all around, but like to put an emphasis on keeping=
 public spaces clean, since there are four of us and messes can pile up q=
uickly. No dishes in the sink overnight, clean your hair out of the drain=
s, help with the sweeping/scrubbing when necessary. Pretty basic stuff.

About You:=20

Personable, employed, and respectful of community spaces. lgbtq-, cat-, a=
nd 420-friendly (although the 420 is kept to rooms or outdoor spaces). No=
 indoor cigarette smokers, please. Preferably no other animals, because O=
livia doesn&#39;t like sharing her space. We&#39;re otherwise not picky. =
It&#39;s a feeling thing, so shoot us an email to say hello and we&#39;ll=
 figure out if you&#39;re a good fit.=20

Important:

This is a room-by-room, one-year lease situation, so you&#39;re not signi=
ng onto ours or subletting. Regular source of income and good credit or a=
 guarantor is required. If you&#39;re serious about the place and moving =
in asap, then bring a deposit and be ready to fill out the application fo=
r our landlord.=20

$780.00 Per Month, Bed Stuy, Brooklyn, Room Available in sunny 2 bedroom =
in Bedstuy December 1
Available: Dec 01, 2014

Hello, all! I have a room to rent in a sunny 2 bedroom apt. in BedStuy bo=
rdering Clinton Hill. I am located off the Bedford-Nostrand stop of the &=
quot;G&quot; train. The neighborhood itself is a mix of young artisticall=
y-inclined people and families. Laundry is a block away, as are many nice=
 restaurants and coffee shops. The block is quite lovely, full of floweri=
ng trees. The term is for 6 mos with a possibility of long-term if we wor=
k out well. Rent is $780 with a deposit of $780 required as well. Really =
great super and landlord, which is exceedingly rare in my experience.The =
room will come unfurnished with one window and a closet. You will be shar=
ing space with one small tabby cat who is friendly and independent, but m=
akes her presence known. Therefore whoever rents here will have to like c=
ats.

Please note: This is not a party house, frat house or flop house. If you =
are someone who likes to host get-togethers and parties at home , this is=
 not the apartment for you. This home is meant to function as a calm resp=
ite from the insanity that in life in NYC

About me:
33 year old makeup/sfx artist and esthetician. I am an introvert who live=
s quietly. I am often home during the day, so would prefer someone with o=
pposite schedule. Friendly, upbeat , but independent and I do my own thin=
g at home. I almost never have guests. I enjoy my red wine and old movies=
, at home, but anything more intense takes place outside of the apartment=
.

About you:
Sane, mature, respectful and friendly fellow 30-something who is gainfull=
y employed or in grad school. Must be able to pay rent and bills on time.=
 Other artists are welcome! Another introvert would be ideal, but not the=
 type who won&#39;t make eye contact , say hello, or makes me feel uncomf=
ortable in my own home. You should at least be laid back and relatively q=
uiet while at home at any rate. You should be relatively clean, but not a=
nal. Guests should be infrequent and respectful. Please no live in bf/gfs=
. Please no persons with alcohol/drug problems. I may be open to addition=
al pets! Take note, pet owners.

Thank you and I hope to hear from you.=20

It&#39;s a really great area and neighborhood, restaurants, bars, and caf=

$900.00 Per Month, Bushwick, Brooklyn, 160 sq. ft., Nice size and clean b=
edroom. Includes exposed brick fireplace and built-in closet with vanity.=
 Plus a big backyard!
Available: Nov 15, 2014

Looking for a nice, respectful roommate, (female preferred) to share a tw=
o bedroom apartment in Bushwick. The room is $900/month, $900 security de=
posit, and we split the utilities down the middle. This large front room =
for rent, (10ftx16ft), is really sunny with two windows and high ceilings=
. It has hardwood floors and is unfurnished but includes a built-in close=
t and an exposed brick fireplace with a vanity mirror cabinet. The apartm=
ent is super clean, cute, and fully furnished. It includes a shared livin=
g room, kitchen, bathroom and huge backyard. It&#39;s a railroad style ap=
t but there are no walk-through rooms so the room is totally private with=
 your own door and key. The only downside is you have to walk through the=
 hallway to access the rest of apartment.

I do a lot of gardening in the warmer months and cook often. The backyard=
 is pretty private and only shared by one neighbor. I also have an older =
cat that is super chill and hangs in the common areas. Sorry, no addition=
al pets.

There are coffee shops, laundry, a wine shop, and a new bar/restaurant, a=
ll within a block of the apartment. The best part of the location is trai=
n options! Located in between the Morgan L and Myrtle/Broadway JMZ both o=
nly a 10min walk. There are new places opening all the time in addition t=
o great bars, restaurants, grocery stores, artwork, and cool vibes.

This could start as a short-term rental and could possibly extend till th=
e end of next summer if we are both happy with the situation. I will need=
 one work and personal reference. The room is available now and I&#39;m r=
enting it for the 15th but I&#39;m flexible on a move-in date (earlier or=
 later). Contact me if you&#39;re interested and tell me a little about y=
ourself.

Happy hunting and I look forward to hearing from you!

$1,025.00 Per Month, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, 120 sq. ft., Spacious, quiet,=
 bright room with 2 closets in Fort Greene
Available: Nov 23, 2014

We are seeking one roommate for our 3 bedroom in Fort Greene / Clinton Hi=
ll area November 23rd - $1,025/mo + $900 security deposit + utilities + $=
350 for new full sized bed and mattress. This is a sublet for at least 2 =
months, but potentially longer.

The building is located less than 2 blocks from the Clinton / Washington =
G on a safe, tree-lined street, surrounded on all sides by restaurants, s=
hops, and grocery stores. Pratt campus is one block away, Fort Greene par=
k is right down the street, and we&#39;re a short walk from the farmer&#3=
9;s market every weekend.

Our pre-war building has a large, well-maintained lobby with crown moldin=
g, an on-site super, and a laundry room off the courtyard. Our unit is on=
 the top floor of a 4-story walk-up with lovely views of the surrounding =
area.=20

Our apartment features a private layout with three bedrooms and a kitchen=
 coming off of one hallway. Our large, eat-in kitchen serves as a cozy li=
ving / dining room as well, and we keep it in tip-top shape so it&#39;s a=
lways clean and inviting.=20

The room itself is 120 sq feet (not including closets) and situated at th=
e end of the hall on its own private side of the apartment. It features 2=
 big closets with built-in shelving and mirrors, a window that gets lots =
of sun during the day, a fire escape, gas heater, and wood floors. The sp=
ace comes with a full sized bed and mattress and could easily fit other f=
urniture items including a dresser, desk, chair, etc.

We are two roommates who appreciate a mellow, clean, and comfortable livi=
ng space. Dion works at Opening Ceremony headquarters and is usually only=
 home in the evenings, and Hannah is a jewelry designer with a fluctuatin=
g schedule. We are both in our mid-twenties, share a love for cooking, ar=
t / design, and socializing (but we don&#39;t bring the party home). If y=
ou&#39;re interested in taking a look at the apartment, please send us an=
 e-mail with your description, website, and / or social media links, and =
we look forward to meeting you.

$600.00 Per Month, Ridgewood, Queens, 104 sq. ft., Spacious apartment wit=
h shared workspace for artists
Available: Dec 01, 2014

Two rooms have opened up in my apartment. One roommate (Yumi) is moving i=
n with her boyfriend and the second roommate (Gabby) is moving back with =
her parents to save money. =20

Room 1 is 13 x 8 and is $600/month. There is a possibility of a bureau th=
at can be included as Gabby says she doesn&#39;t need it. =20

Room 2 is smaller and is $500/month. I wish I could give you the dimensio=
ns but Yumi is never home and it is currently locked.  You can fit a full=
 bed in here but I recommend a twin. =20

You have the option of using the living room as a shared workshop. If you=
 are a musician there needs to be communication about when you are practi=
cing but I&#39;m pretty open to supporting your creative practice.  My ol=
d roommate Kevin had the smaller room before and basically set up his off=
ice/bedroom extension in the shared common space and it was totally fine =
and nice to have him around. =20

I&#39;m an arts educator/visual artist who is also an amateur musician (v=
ocals and baritone uke). I like to have my home relatively clean but am n=
ot OCD in the least.  Dishes need to be managed but I understand if you a=
re running late and need to wash something later.  We all pitch in with c=
hores and we also communicate if there is something happening in the spac=
e that we&#39;d like to change (cleaning schedule etc).  I also have an a=
dorable and playful cat named Lemmy (Yumi and Gabby love her) who will to=
tally stay out of your room if you want but is very sweet and friendly.  =
But yes, dander happens if you are allergic.  =20

I love plants, going to shows (music and art), science geekery (big Radio=
lab fan) and am getting into writing lately.  I am totally down for cooki=
ng together and like having a convivial home.  More than happy to share m=
y yoga mat or some food and like unwinding with roommates after a day&#39=
;s work. =20

The apartment is on a dead-end tree-lined street (yes these exist in NYC!=
) very close to all amenities. Fresh Pond Road has everything you need.  =
The neighborhood is extremely safe with lots of families and folks who ca=
re about their neighborhood.  I love how calm and quiet it is out here an=
d hopefully you will too.=20

Where?=20

Available: Nov 15, 2014 through Aug 31, 2015

Hey all,

One room is opening up in my 4-bedroom apartment at Driggs Ave and Graham=
 Ave in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, starting November 15, and you totally wanna=
 live in it. Here are the vitals:

What I&#39;m looking for in a new roommate:

-One person only. No couples (or triads or any other groups, lol). No ful=
l time students.

-You must intend to stay through August 2015 (when the lease is up) if ev=
erything works out well and be willing to sign a roommate agreement that =
covers expectations and responsibilities for living here (all reasonable =
stuff).

-No pets. Animals are allowed in the building and I love them, but I don&=
#39;t want any living in the apartment.

-Have your shit together. If you&#39;re broke, unemployed, have too littl=
e or no income or want to ask for a payment plan for the rent, or to not =
be super responsible and normal and reliable in any way, don&#39;t email =
me.

-Be able to pay rent for Nov 15-30, December, and security ($475 plus $95=
0 plus $950 =3D $2375) up front in order to secure your place in the apar=
tment, and $950 rent plus about $60 for utilities (internet, gas and elec=
tric) each month on the 25th of the month going forward (because I collec=
t each roommate&#39;s rent and then pay the whole rent to the landlord my=
self on the 1st since I&#39;m the only one on the lease).

-Be willing to not smoke anything in the apartment and not use, keep, buy=
 or sell recreational drugs in the apartment.

-Be nice, considerate, clean, friendly, responsible and reliable, and onl=
y bring stuff that you intend to keep in your room. Don&#39;t bring commo=
n space furniture, please. We&#39;re covered.

Room info:
Dimensions: 8 feet by 8.5 feet

Unfurnished (photos are with the current roommate&#39;s stuff in it, whic=
h she will be taking with her)

Real windows to the outside: 1

Bullshit fake &quot;windows&quot; that look into the rest of the apartmen=
t: none

Real, complete, actual floor-to-ceiling walls: 4

Door: Uh, yeah, you&#39;re a human being. There&#39;s a real door.

Floor: beautiful hardwood. &#39;cause you&#39;ve got good taste, baby!

Ceiling: there&#39;s one of those, too!

Is it a bullshit loft space that you can&#39;t stand up straight in? No.

Is there a built in lofted bed so you can live like an 11 year old in a b=
unk? No.

What it can fit: full or queen bed (depending on how much floor space you=
 want), small desk, chair, small chest of drawers, whatever you want. It&=
#39;s big enough to fit your life into fo&#39; sho&#39; if you have a rea=
sonable amount of stuff.

Closet: 1

Apartment info:

-4 bedrooms, 4 roommates (once the current one moves out, you&#39;d be th=
e new 4th), no pets currently

-1 bathroom. People are out a lot and it&#39;s never an issue.

-Windows to the outside in every room including the common space and bath=
room

-new kitchen appliances, everything in great condition and working order,=
 great bathroom, no mold or vermin/pest issues

-2nd floor walk up

-6-unit, 3-story, well-managed building with very nice landlord and neigh=
bors

-I am the only person on the lease, which started on Sept 1 and goes unti=
l Aug 31 of 2015, and everyone else in the apartment sublets their room f=
rom me.

-I love bright colors, patterns and cute, original things in home decor, =
and I plan to decorate the common space in the aesthetic of &quot;Pee-Wee=
&#39;s Playhouse with taste and style.&quot; I don&#39;t know exactly how=
 that&#39;s going to pan out yet, but the pics of the bathroom in this po=
st should give you a sense of what I like. It&#39;s going to be tasteful =
and something we can all be proud of, but it&#39;s going to be bright and=
 silly and fun, so if you like beige, tastelessness and clutter, this is =
not the place for you. Another thing that will let you know how I plan to=
 decorate is that the tea kettle I got for the apartment looks like a car=
toon elephant, complete with little tusks and a trunk for a handle. It br=
ings us all joy every day.

Roommate info:

Current roommates are one 30 yr old woman working in the arts and two 26 =
year old men working in TV production and tech. Everyone is nice, easygoi=
ng, friendly, considerate, clean, neat, nonsmoking, responsible, reliable=
, and generally great. We get along well and want to keep a friendly and =
considerate vibe in the apartment. Parties, social time and bringing gues=
ts over are all totally fine as long as we&#39;re all in communication ab=
out it and it doesn&#39;t bother anyone. I don&#39;t like it when people =
say &quot;don&#39;t bring the party home.&quot; Parties are for wherever =
parties need to be, and homes should be happy, chill places.

Neighborhood info:

Greenpoint is awesome and everybody loves it. Read some blog posts about =
it if you don&#39;t already know, but basically it has great food, bars, =
shopping, services, social life, McCarren park is right near the apartmen=
t, and we&#39;re a very short walk from prime Williamsburg. The Bedford L=
 stop is a 12 minute walk, and the Nassau G is a 5 minute walk, and the G=
 has gotten way better in recent years.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

$1,450.00 Per Month, Bushwick, Brooklyn, 250 (1000) sq. ft., Huge, Bright=
, Furnished Bedroom in Beautiful 2BR Loft
Available: Nov 24, 2014 through Jul 31, 2015

$1450 including internet and all utilties

Note: Looking for Dec 1 to July 31, but dates are somewhat flexible.

- The building is an old automotive parts warehouse with about 8 live/wor=
k units. Many of the residents have lived here for 10+ years. It&#39;s no=
t like the loft-dorm buildings around Morgan and Jefferson.

- On Jefferson Street, half a block (really, half a block) from the Jeffe=
rson L stop.

- 2BR apt will be shared with my roommate, who is a clean, quiet, and res=
ponsible 30-something gay male who works at an art gallery. You should al=
so be clean, quiet (i.e. not playing loud music constantly), and responsi=
ble.

- Bedroom is 250sf, apt is about 1000sf.

- The room and apt are fully furnished.=20

- The bedroom has a custom-built queen size loft bed (you won&#39;t hit y=
our head on the ceiling), a 96x36&quot; desk with a set of drawers undern=
eath, rocking chair, and dresser. There&#39;s plenty of storage space und=
er the loft bed. You can also put a bed under the loft if you don&#39;t w=
ant to climb up to bed.

- I have a projector in the bedroom that beams a 9-foot-wide image on the=
 wall above my desk.=20

- Bedroom is bright all day and gets direct afternoon sunlight.

- Spacious kitchen with a big prep table and lots of cookware/utensils. P=
lenty of room for food in the fridge and cabinets.

- Large European-style bathroom.=20

- There&#39;s a bit of street noise during the week. Nights and weekends =
are usually very quiet. Neighbors occasionally make noise but that&#39;s =
true anywhere around here.

- The neighborhood is well-served in terms of cafes, restaurants, and bar=
s. Seems like every week there&#39;s a new establishment opening. The peo=
ple are positive, creative, and energetic, and invested in the community =
in a way that&#39;s unlike other NYC neighborhoods I&#39;ve lived in.

- Renter must be clean, considerate, reliable, and careful with other peo=
ple&#39;s stuff.

- Working from home is ok, but not with smelly or messy materials. And wo=
rkspace should usually be confined to the bedroom.

- Couples might ok but would have to pay more.

- No smoking in the apt (but we do have a private balcony where you can s=
moke)

- No pets

Available: Dec 20, 2014 through Jan 19, 2015

About me:=20
hi im in grad school for interior design. I worked in  the art world for =
several years and i deal fine art/ curate on the side. i am from nyc and =
la and italy.

About space: Classic chinatown bldg is a Huge room (200 sq ft) nearly siz=
e of studio, with amazing heating you can control right by bed, Ac (if yo=
u need it) fire escape for hanging out (be careful!!!!!!). This is a shar=
ed roommate situation; the apt is shared with three other people. Two of =
whom are hardly home and I never see, so it feels like you have your own =
apt virtually all the time. The kitchen/bathroom are basic and there is a=
 cleaning service that comes every friday (takes out trash, washes dishes=
 cleans floors etc).=20

There is laundry immediately downstairs and the bldg is by far in the ver=
y best area in manhattan, soho is literally 10 mins away it&#39;s great y=
ou are in heart of lower east side tons of delis amazing things etc. the =
neighborhood is obviously amazing and the price is really good for the si=
ze of the room, in spite of having roommates.=20

I&#39;m looking to rent out the room from Dec 19/20-Jan 19/20 partly furn=
ished (therefore there won&#39;t be so many clothes every where and I wil=
l take out some of the furniture so it&#39;s not as crowded). However, if=
 you really like the space I might allow you to stay longer since I might=
 move and the rent&#39;s month to month. So hopefully this would work wel=
l for somebody and you could take over the lease maybe- otherwise just sh=
ort term I&#39;m sure you would absolutely love. xoxxoxo text me for ques=
tions .=20

$1,125.00 Per Month, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 1 Lovely BDR in Williamsburg=
 2 BDR apartment small brick building
Available: Dec 01, 2014

My place is a lovely 2 bedroom ,1 bathroom apartment in Brooklyn.

The space:=20
I have a great 2 bedroom apartment in the popular Williamsburg neighborho=
od. The apartment is on the third floor of a 3 unit brick building very c=
ommon and historic in Brooklyn. I am the top unit , I can see tree tops o=
ut of all the windows. The entire apartment is hardwood floors with lots =
of natural light and and an overall great place to spend time. The floor =
plan is very open. The kitchen, eating nook, and living room are one conn=
ected space, and the 2 bedrooms are on opposite ends of the apartment, wh=
ich offers nice privacy for roommates. The bedroom faces a park in the ba=
ck and is cozy with a large window with trees filtering a lot of the ligh=
t. This bedroom could come with a full size bed if you would like, but it=
 easy to remove if you want a blank slate.  The room faces opposite of th=
e street so it feels nice and tucked away. It is fully equipped with WiFi=
. I have one full bathroom, with a tub and a shower, clean and white! All=
 the things you might need in a full kitchen right next to a great little=
 eating nook. The living room is equipped with a daybed with two large wi=
ndows.  This room is very comfortable and easy to relax in.  There is a s=
helf but no closet in the bedroom, but the closet in the living room is e=
ntirely yours.

location:=20
I love being in Williamsburg so close to such lively and interesting shop=
s and restaurants on Bedford, Wythe, Berry and Havermeyer streets. From h=
ere great coffee shops, restaurants,and boutiques, are steps away. Despit=
e the close proximity to all of these things, my street is just quiet eno=
ugh for a reprieve if you need a little oasis away from the action,.  It =
is on the south side (S. 4th in between Berry and Bedford) of Williamsbur=
g but north of Broadway.  It is just a mere 8 minute walk to the &quot;L&=
quot; and&quot;JMZ&quot; trains, both only one stop away from Manhattan. =
My landlord lives in the building for a very convivial and safe feel.

Available: Dec 06, 2014 through Dec 06, 2015

We (3) are looking for a *sublet.=20

The apartment is (1) F and (2) M; 2 in their late 20s and 1 in his early =
30s.
Two are artists and the other is a social worker, all very kind and respe=
ctful towards each other.

We are looking for anyone in that age range with a steady job that keeps =
them busy.=20

The neighborhood is quickly becoming more expensive. There&#39;s a new mu=
ral every time I look outside. It&#39;s a close knit community here, a st=
eady mix of New Yorkers born and raised, and new New Yorkers.

You would have two huge windows, and a gas heater built in. The light in =
the both the room and the apartment is beautiful, with afternoon sun draw=
ing it&#39;s way across the walls. There&#39;s a J line that runs outside=
 the window, which is a truly unique experience in 2014 New York. The apa=
rtment is on the 3rd floor and we have direct stairwell access to the roo=
f, a space in and of its own with multitudes of potential.=20

Regarding pets; we have 2 time-share dogs who both vary in duration of st=
ay. They are two ladies, Agnes and Cassidy, and are both incredibly sweet=
 and kind natured.=20

* With the potential for longer term. Longer term requires deposit.

$1,250.00 Per Month, Columbia St. Waterfront District, Brooklyn, Cozy Col=

Available: Dec 01, 2014

Furnished room available in lovely 2 bedroom apartment in the Columbia Wa=
terfront neighborhood. Exposed brick, hardwood floors, great light, bedro=
oms face a beautiful view of Lower Manhattan. The room has a full-sized b=
ed, dresser, and wardrobe for hanging storage. $1,250 includes utilities =
and wifi. A $1,250 deposit is required. The landlord controls the heat, w=
hich there is plenty of, and hot water -- no tepid dribble showers going =
on here. Full-sized bathtub too. I&#39;m a woman in my late 30&#39;s with=
 a dog -- a 1.5 year old energetic and absurdly affectionate lab mix who =
already loves you to bits. If you love canine company, then she will be a=
 great companion. If dogs annoy you, she will drive you bananas. I have n=
o such simple equation for my human company, however -- that you&#39;ll j=
ust have to check out for yourself. I&#39;m an artist with a number of jo=
bs that keep working out of the house or in my studio for the time being,=
 though I am a homebody and work from home when I can. I like to be in my=
 pj&#39;s making soup and catching up on TAL or Radiolab whenever possibl=
e. That&#39;s the kind of wild lifestyle you&#39;d be in for if you lived=
 with me.

It&#39;s definitely a no smoking kind of place. My dog would probably lov=
e your cat but I&#39;m allergic. And the space isn&#39;t suitable for cou=
ples (or is it that I&#39;m allergic to couples and the space isn&#39;t s=
uitable for cats? I forget).

If you&#39;re looking in this neighborhood then you already know what a t=
errific place it is, and how hard it is to find anything here. Short or l=
onger term arrangements are ok. Let me know if you&#39;d like to come by.=

$1,040.00 Per Month, East Harlem/UES, New York, NY, Unfurnished Bedroom A=
vailable in Large Furnished 2 Bedroom
Available: Nov 11, 2014 through Jul 01, 2015

Hello!=20
This post is for a sublease/share at 101st near Lexington Ave. It is avai=
lable NOW, but we can arrange for a November 15th move in. Either way, th=
e month of November will be pro rated accordingly. The sublease is a one =
bedroom in a very large two bedroom apartment with a full, separate kitch=
en, large living area, and second bedroom on the other side of the apartm=
ent. The bedroom is unfurnished, but the rest of the apartment is furnish=
ed. The apartment is very clean and in a safe and friendly area. It is wa=
lking distance grocery stores, restaurants, a community garden, Central P=
ark, and the 6 train.=20

The co-tenant is a very sweet and friendly woman who works long business =
hours. Please do not reply if you want to bring the party home. However, =
we both have enjoyed having friends and family over with an overnight gue=
st from time to time, but we have both been respectful of each other&#39;=
s space.=20
This is a sublease situation that would end July 1st, 2015. At that time,=
 the lease on the apartment ends, so there may be opportunity for you to =
renew as the new tenant.=20
I only require rent upon move in, and no additional deposit. (since you w=
ill only be subleasing).=20
Thanks so much, and I look forward to hearing from you!

$2,800.00 Per Month, Red Hook, Brooklyn, 1200 sq. ft., Luminous Open Loft=
 Space in Historical Factory Building
Available: Jan 06, 2015 through Oct 03, 2015

Open, 1200 sq.ft. loft space with 14&#39; ceilings and constant beautiful=
 light from seven 8ft tall windows with views of both  Manhattan and down=
town Brooklyn skylines. The building is located right on Coffey Park in t=
he center of Red Hook, just a couple blocks from Van Brunt St. and all ou=
r great bars, shops, restaurants and bus lines. The G an F subway lines a=
re a 15 min. walk into Carroll Gardens, or a shorter but more harrowing w=
alk across Hamilton Ave. to Smith &amp; 9th. There is also the Ferry Serv=
ice to Wall St. with stops at both the Ikea &amp; Fairway docks. Street p=
arking is fairly easy around the building if you have a car. Bicycles may=
 be parked in the courtyard.

Laundries are located on each of the four floors, as are garbage and recy=
cling stations. The loft has a full bathroom with a claw foot tub. there =
is a fully equipped kitchen t one end of the space with a large round din=
ing table and long wooden prep table. There is a Bose CD/mp3 player amp a=
nd DVD player, WiFi and AC. Heating is independent with thermostat. There=
 is a 6 ft x 42&quot; drawing table and a 14&#39; x 11&#39; working wall =
for large drawings.

This loft is organized for one person,( although couples have been happy =
here ), as there is no divided space, no roommate arrangements will be co=
nsidered. But there is really nothing like one great big room all to your=
self.

Also, whereas this is the perfect place to draw or work on small models, =
I am sorry that I cannot allow painting or sculpting or power tools.

I have a lease on the space since 2005 with permission to sublet. I provi=
de the management with contact information for my tenants and, so far, I =
have not encountered any problems with my management as I remain responsi=
ble for the rent and everything else.

I spend, usually, 6 consecutive months a year in the space, this year bei=
ng an exception as I will be out of the country again in January.

The space is an excellent place to complete a project, to get acquainted =
with NYC or Red Hook itself before moving into a space of own&#39;s own. =
Most of my tenants have been after this sort of thing.=20

I am neither a manager nor a broker and have rejected all inquiries from =
brokers or agents, even when they claim to be interested only for themsel=
ves. Who can believe them?

There are no fees, I ask only a security deposit and first and last month=
&#39;s rent as is common in subletting. I am not interested in short term=
, AirBnb type renting as I find it would be unfair to both my neighbors a=
nd my management.

I will be showing the space myself. I have a sublease contract that I ame=
nd , if needed, with the tenant. I must meet anyone personally who will l=
ive in my space and I may ask for a recommendation.

$1,750.00 Per Month, Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, 650 sq. ft., Long-Term O=
ne Bedroom Apartment Sublet in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn
Available: Dec 01, 2014 through Jul 31, 2016

I am looking for a subletter for my one bed apartment in Prospect Heights=
, Brooklyn. This is a legal sublet and the rent is incredibly low for the=
 neighborhood.   =20

The apartment is on Vanderbilt Ave (on the quietest blocks of the street)=
 right off of the 2/3 (Grand Army Plaza) and Q/B (7th Ave) train stops. I=
t is literally steps from the local French patisserie, juice spot, fishmo=
ngers, dry cleaners, book store, European deli and supermarket and the lo=
cal green cart owner Rudi sells fresh produce on the corner. The laundere=
tte is directly across the street!  Prospect Park, the central library, f=
armers market, Botanical Gardens and Brooklyn Museum are all just a five =
minute walk. =20

The apartment itself is on the ground floor of a small building and is ap=
proximately 650 sq. ft.   There is an eat-in kitchen (8x10), good-sized l=
iving room (12 x12) and bathroom with linen closet with tons of storage t=
hroughout (three large closets - 2 in hall &amp; 1 in kitchen). The bedro=
om is compact (around 10&#39;x11&#39;).Shelving and additional lighting a=
re already installed in the bedroom. Additionally, the entryway has been =
fitted with storage cabinets and shoe cubbies. Being at the rear of the b=
uilding, the apartment is unbelievably private and quiet and the kitchen =
window overlooks a secluded yard which gets lots of morning sun. =20

Heating and water are included; subletter will be expected to pay for oth=
er utilities. The apartment would be perfect for a couple or someone livi=
ng on their own.=20

The apartment will be available as of December 1st. If you or someone you=
 know might be a good fit, please have them contact me.

Thank so much.

Best,
Jonathan

$2,225.00 Per Month, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Spacious apartment near the =
Graham
Available: Dec 01, 2014 through Mar 31, 2015

I&#39;m going out of town for the winter. Come stay at my place in Willia=
msburg!

The area is full of cafes, bars and restaurants. The apartment is pretty =
large. I don&#39;t know what exactly the square footage is. A couple of s=
ame-sized units in the building are shared by 3 people, but you get it al=
l to yourself.

In the living room, there is a 40&quot; TV, video games, a media server, =
fast cable internet. The laser cut wood panels on the wall are my origina=
l artwork! There is a large table with 4 chairs.

The bedroom is pretty much as big as the living room, minus the attached =
kitchen. It has a large closet and a ton of space in the dressers (4 draw=
ers and 2 shelves). The bed is queen size.

For transportation, you&#39;ve got the Graham L just a few blocks away. T=
he G train at Lorimer is about 8 minutes walking. The Q59 is good route t=
o get to the strip on Grand St west of the BQE and the B43 runs a straigh=
t shot up Graham Ave to Greenpoint on Manhattan Ave. If you want to put d=
own an additional deposit, you could use my beloved Raleigh road bike.

Utilities are included.

I am the sole tenant of this apartment. I am leaving town for 4 months an=
d would like to sublet the place while I&#39;m gone. For the duration of =
the sublet I will be in San Francisco. I have permission from my landlord=
 to sublet the place so everything is above board, so to speak.

I&#39;ll be available to show the space anytime between now and the end o=
f the month. I&#39;d like to meet any potential tenants before renting.

terature and children&#39;s rights. The little one likes dogs and books. =
She hangs out with us during the day, usually in the park, as we take tur=
ns working.=20

, with great success!) The current lease is coming to an end and we have =
decided to stay on a few months longer.=20
We would like to stay in the same area as we like it here. So, preferably=
 Prospect / Crown Heights / Park Slope or somewhere else around Prospect =

n. Ideally we would like to pay max 2000 /month. We can pay in advance.
Don&#39;t hesitate to contact us with any questions! We are subletting ou=
r flat in Sweden, so we how important it is to find someone you trust to =
stay in your place.=20

We are looking for January and February, but we might be interested in Ma=
rch for the right place!

We are also open to house sitting or pet sitting (allergy friendly pets) =
in OR outside the NYC area!
