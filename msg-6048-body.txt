Label News

Hi everyone and welcome to the Sorry State Records update for March!

It's been kind of a weird couple of weeks for me. I got called in for
jury duty a couple of weeks ago and I got put on the jury for a rather
major crime. The trial is supposed to last up to two weeks, which
means that I'm in court all day every day, and I'm only able to do
label / shop stuff (not to mention my day job as a teacher!) when I
get home at night. Unfortunately most of my energy has to go to
behind-the-scenes things like accounting, ordering, responding to
emails, and managing this list, so I haven't been able to work at the
shop as much, and unfortunately I haven't been able to write
descriptions for a lot of the new releases that have come in (and
there are some great new ones I haven't even heard yet, like the new
EPs from Mulltute and Damages, for instance). Fortunately, Jeff and
Seth (as well as our new employee Alyssa) have been holding things
down at the shop and making sure both the store and the mailorder are
running smoothly, so hopefully no one out there has really noticed my
absence.

While I'm on the subject of my jury duty, there's another thing I
wanted to mention. I can't really talk about the trial while it's
going on, but it's for a series of really violent, nasty crimes that
took place in my neighborhood. Hearing testimony from the victims and
looking at the evidence (including numerous graphic photos) has really
gotten me thinking about the fetishization of violent imagery and
language in the punk scene. I don't necessarily have anything against
this in principle, but it's strange to hear words like "assault,"
"brutality," "rage," etc. bandied about in one context in my punk
life, then to see their very real and chilling effects on real people
in my very own neighborhood. I don't really have a thesis here, I just
wanted to share that it's something I'm thinking about it, and maybe
it might give people pause about the ways they use these terms and
images.

Alright, now that that's out of the way we can get back to the fun
stuff. The cassette releases that I mentioned last update (Skem=C3=A4ta
and Narcoman) are coming along nicely. Both have been sent off for
duplication and we're currently finishing up the artwork, so hopefully
we're still on track for a mid-March release date for both of these.
Still no new vinyl planned at the moment, but we have a lot of things
in the incubation stage, so there will be plenty more news from Sorry
State in 2014.

Oh, and a couple of notes for those of you in and around North
Carolina:

It's been a particularly sick month for used records at the shop... if
you're getting your tax return or some other windfall it's a good time
to visit the shop. And if you're wondering what's been coming in or if
you're just into looking at pictures of killer records, you should be
sure to follow us on Instagram @sorrystate (
http://instagram.com/sorrystate ).

Also, later this month (the 23rd to be precise) I'm booking a show for
Boston's Casanovas in Heat. Here's a pic of the poster I made:

And here's a link to the Facebook event with all of the details:
https://www.facebook.com/events/673254532731581/ (

And of course if you're wondering what else is happening in the area,
you should probably be checking out the new local message board,
Distort Raleigh ( http://distortraleigh.com/ ), on a regular basis.

Jeff's Update

Hey Sorry State subscribers!I feel like this past month has been
great for new releases.  I can't recommend enough the Funeral Parade
12" EP!  Kinda gothy, dark post-punk, super good!  I recently found
out that I think the tracks on the LP are remastered versions of a
demo from 2010, but I'm just now hearing it and it's great.  Also
really been digging the Damages Reality Disease 7", the Pig//Control
Trauma 7" is really great, M=C3=BCllt=C3=BCte's 3rd EP, Unknown to God 7", =
and
not surprisingly, I love the Dissekerad LP (members of Totalit=C3=A4r!).
On a less hardcore note, the White Murder 12" and the new Earth Girls
demo are awesome!  There's a bunch of others too that I'm probably
forgetting...

On a more personal note I've got some stuff with my bands coming up:

Mercy Killings is playing a few shows at the end of March in Atlanta,
Charlotte, and a couple other places.  Also, we're playing the
Saturday show at Damaged City fest in DC, so I'm stoked about that!

Also, I've got a new band called Skem=C3=A4ta with Alex who was in
Stripmines with me and Cameron from Logic Problem/Double
Negative/alotofotherbands.  I'm really excited about it, and we're
hoping play outside of NC more pretty soon.  Also, our demo tape
should be out Sorry State really soon!

Talk to everybody next month!
-Jeff

Seth's Update

My big pick for this month is definitely the hysterics 7".  I had
heard a couple of things about this band but never got around to
checking it out.  This record is amazing though.  It's fast and angry
with a lot of punk attitude.  Also like Jeff I've been into the
funeral parade 12" and the Earth Girls demo.

In other news my band Black Zinfandel finally had demo tapes for
sale. Almost 2 years and we have finally gotten around to that.  I'll
hopefully have some on the online store next week, so keep an eye out.
If you like dirty garage punk check it out.  We're playing around the
triangle some this month. Check Facebook.com/blackzinfandel (
http://www.facebook.com/blackzinfandel ) for when and where.  Also
mystic inane from New Orleans will be playing at nice price records on
the 30th of march with Drag Sounds from Greensboro and Magic Attic,
which is the new band of Scott Williams of Double Negative and Sean of
Shoxx and Pollution. Should be a great show to end the month.

Daniel's Update

So, like I said I haven't gotten as much listening time in this month
as I would prefer, but I am really, really psyched to hear that
Mulltute EP... they're one of the best current bands in Europe in my
opinion, and Jeff assures me that the new EP is even better than the
last one... fans of Amde Petersen's Arme take note! Along with the
Mulltute 7" we also got a bunch of other releases from Heart First
records, including restocks of tough to find records by Kriegshog and
Vaaska. As for other stuff, I have to reiterate Seth's recommendation
of the new Hysterics EP... they were my favorite band at Damaged City
Fest last year, and the new EP absolutely destroys... total Void
vibes, but without sounding like a tribute act at all. The new
Fugitive Family EP is also excellent. Featuring the creative core of
the terribly-underrated Reason of Insanity, this is similarly
face-melting. As for LPs, the Glow God and White Murder records are
both fantastic in completely different ways, and I'm also loving the
Earth Girls demo, wherein Liz from Libyans / Broken Prayer / Siamese
Twins shows off her poppier side.

In addition to these new releases, we also got in TONS of classic punk
titles... you can see the full list below, but there's lots of stuff
we haven't carried before, like almost all of the early Killed by
Death and Bloodstains comps, most of the Naked Raygun catalog, the UK
Subhumans, as well as tons of stuff from heavier labels like Season of
Mist and Death Wish.

Also, the descriptions will be on the next update, but we just had a
slew of new releases come in today, like the much-anticipated Warthog
EP, the new releases on Ugly Pop (Bent Wind and Thor's Hammer LPs) and
numerous others! Those should be on the site by the time you read
this.

Featured Distro Items

The Real Energy: Beyond Delay 12" (Erste Theke Tontrager)
New 12" from this Houston bands featuring members of No Talk, Secret
Prostitutes, Reason of Insanity, and many more I'm sure. Of course all
of those bands have a very different sound from one another, and the
Real Energy is no different. They remind me of the more rock-oriented
'77 UK punk bands like 999 and the UK Subs... the songs are
high-energy and definitely punk, but there's a kind of classic rock
songwriting sensibility on display that not a lot of bands can pull
off. Basically, this is just high-energy rock and roll with classic
hooks, not pandering to any particular vibe like '77 retro or garage
rock... you don't hear many bands like this and it totally rages.

The Electric Vomit: S/T 7" (Garbage Bag)
Archival release from this obscure Montreal band who I don't believe
released anything during their original run, but one of the members
went on to form the (terribly underrated) Nils. As for this, it's
totally awesome. I love punk from this era when it sounds like the Sex
Pistols are pretty much their only and exclusive model for what punk
is. The vocals are so Rotten-inspired their almost an imitation, and
the music is sort of inept, three-chord punk, but with a real sense of
swagger. The three songs here are perhaps a little goofy, but if you
dig the sort of first-wave of punk diaspora or KBD stuff this is well
worth hearing. Oh, and by the way this release came out like 10 years
ago or something and these are a recently-recovered batch of dead
stock copies, not likely to be restocked again.

Solitary Confinement: demo cassette (Mind Rot)
Demo tape from this new band out of Virginia Beach, VA. This
definitely fits in with the current wave of oi!-tinged HC bands like
Violent Reaction, Violent Future, etc.... simple riffs, tough vocals,
and kind of a stomping rhythm alternating with fast, Negative
Approach-inspired parts. Negative Approach and Last Rights are
probably the best older band comparisons as well, as this has some
really solid, raw but not overly raw production that makes it hit
super hard. Basically, if you like any of the bands mentioned here
you'll be feeling this.

Forward / Teargas: Split 7" (Hardcore Victim)
Split 7" released for these two bands' joint Australian tour. Forward
contribute two tracks and they continue the tear they've been on with
their recent slate of releases, all of which I have though were
top-notch and above the best in their discography. As for Teargas,
they're clearly heavily Burning Spirits-inspired, but their ripping
leads have more of the epic sweep of Death Side... a pretty darn
killer split 7".

Last Chaos / Vaarallinen: Split 7" (Hardcore Victim)
Split 7" from these two bands that I think might have toured together
recently? Last Chaos are from Brisbane, Australia and play Destino
Final-inspired d-beat hardcore with delay on the vox. They are a bit
faster than your typical d-beat band, running along at more of an
early Finnish HC-type clip, which gives their contribution that extra
little edge of rage it needs. As for Vaarallinen, they're from the
unlikely locale of Singapore and they're also inspired by the sounds
of early Finnish HC, but they have a more straightforward sound that
reminds me a bit of Kieltolaki.

Unknown to God: S/T 7" (Hardcore Victim)
New 7" from this Australian band who had a previous split 7" with
fellow Aussies Death Cage. Clearly inspired by Japanese HC, this is
all epic riffs and throat-gargling vox... fans of Death Side, Crude,
Bastard, etc. need apply.

Havittajat: S/T 7" (Hardcore Victim)
Seems like the Finnish sound is a bit in vogue in Australia right
now... this new Melbourne band features members of Kromosom and
Leprosy and plays vicious, 1-2 1-2 hardcore that sounds more than a
little bit like S/T LP-era Rattus and early Terveet Kadet. Perfect
production on this one also puts it over the top... definitely my
favorite out of the latest batch of Hardcore Victim releases!

Hysterics: Can't I Live? 7" (M'Lady's)
2nd EP from this GREAT all-lady band from Olympia, WA. I've been
somewhat obsessed with this band since seeing them at last year's
Damaged City Fest, where they were easily the best band of the
weekend. This EP absolutely lives up to those expectations... it's
just total Dischord-style, with wild, Void-esque guitar, primitive
hardcore rhythms, and some of the most authoritative vocals in punk.
Seriously, this could be the hardcore EP of the year... highest
possible recommendation GET ON IT!

Fugitive Family: Putrid Remains 7" (Psycho Wolf)
Debut 7" from this new band featuring Josh and Howie from Reason of
Insanity... Josh also plays in Secret Prostitutes, the Energy, No Talk
and tons of other Texas bands if that does something for you. Anyway,
ROI is one of the most criminally underrated bands out there, and
Fugitive Family is appropriately raging... it's a little more
mid-paced and locked-in than ROI's more frantic sound (particularly on
the b-side, which is almost like a harder Secret Prostitutes-type
song), but still definitely super hardcore and the riffs are
incredibly inventive and powerful. This is just a perfect, spot-on
hardcore record that will restore your faith in the genre. Highly
recommended.

Dissekerad: S/T 12" (Man in Decline)
US pressing of this Swedish monster. If Institution didn't scratch
your itch for members of Totlitar playing Totalitar-style hardcore
(actually Poffen sings for both bands) then this certainly well.
Actually, I think I vastly prefer this LP to Institution's stuff. It's
a little more Sin Egan Motstandare than Vi Ar Eliten... it's a little
rawer, a little more unhinged, but still has that classic Totalitar
sound and vibe. People have been freaking out about this LP, and
rightly so... if you dig this style you aren't going to do any better
than this. Recommended.

Wrench: demo 2013 cassette (Criminal Rights)
Another day, another ripping demo out of the UK. This time the band
is Wrench, and they play tough, nasty hardcore with a bit of the
skinhead HC sound that's in vogue these days... definitely some early
Agnostic Front vibes here, but I'm guessing these guys have a few
Painkiller Records releases in their collection as well. Regardless,
this is some mean, nasty and rough hardcore with just the right amount
of rawness in the recording. A ripper.

Anti-Zen: S/T cassette (Hesitation Wound)
Demo tape from this killer new band who hail from DC I believe. Fast,
primitive hardcore with high-pitched lady vox that recall Criaturas or
La Misma. The music has this real wall of sound quality, particularly
to the heavy, distorted bass sound, that sounds very much like 80s
Japanese hardcore, but more pre-Burning Spirits-type stuff... the
music is fast and simple, but all the catchier and more powerful for
it. A total ripper of a demo.

Chain Gang Grave: demo cassette (self-released)
Demo tape from this new band from Brooklyn, NY. I really like this
band's sound... it's sort of in this little groove between hardcore
and post-punk. I feel like some songs and parts are definitely
Fall-inspired, but it's harder, faster, and heavier than most bands
who ply that sounds. I could see this appealing to fans of bands like
Protomartyr or Whatever Brains as well as more forward-thinking, kind
of noise rock-ish hardcore bands like Pollution as well. Killer demo.

Jerk Store #13 zine
Latest issue of this top-notch Australian zine. Features writings
about 1981, a Daylight Robbery tour diary, a bunch of spot-on,
incredibly well-written record reviews and a lot of other content for
the discerning punk. I love that Alex has really diverse yet demanding
tastes, and I think it's safe to say that if you're into what Sorry
State does (particularly on the label end of things) this should be
one of your must-read zines.

Various: To Live a Lie Records Volume II 12" (To Live a Lie)
This is on To Live a Lie, so you know what you're getting...
full-bore power violence. Like the label itself, this features a solid
mix of better-known and completely unknown bands, with a couple of
Raleigh groups thrown in for good measure. Features songs from Lapse,
Abuse., Rabid Pigs, Water Torture, Low Threat Profile, Terminal
Crisis, Beartrap, Mad Dog, Congenital Death, Hummingbird of Death,
Grit, Bridge, Sick/Tired, Callous, Chest Pain, Vaccine, xswampx,
Sidetracked, Weekend Nachos, Scalped, Impulse, Vile Intent, False
Light, Cheap Art, To the Point, Super Mutant, Street Pizza, Softdov,
and Slave.

Decreneo: S/T 12" (MMM)
Debut LP from this band from Mallorca, Spain. Like a lot of my
favorite recent Spanish-language punk (La Misma, Silla Electrica) this
is built around kind of bouncy pogo-punk beats and features vicious,
yelping lady vox a la the Comes. There is a hair of rock-n-roll edge
to the guitar playing here as well, recalling the Eskorbuto-influenced
stylings of Ruleta Rusa and Peligro Social, but mostly this is just
vicious, catchy 1-2-1-2 punk... totally killer!

Alarms: Millipede 12" (Landlocked Collective)
Debut LP from this Sacramento band who have had a couple of splits
and EP releases. The sound here is an interesting amalgam of rock,
metal, and hardcore. I'm reminded a little bit of Never Healed, but
this is a little more rocked out. It's sort of if you took the sound
of Wolverine Blues-era Entombed and added just a little bit more tough
hardcore into the mix.

Suicidas: No Mas Mata La Muerte 7" (No Nostalgia)
2nd 7" from this Spanish band who feature members of Destino Final
and Belgrado, but these guys play a much poppier sound. There's a lot
of the downbeat, melodic punk style of La Urss and Insomnio, with big
melodic vocals that are almost radio-friendly. Fans of Boom Boom Kid
would also dig this I think... definitely a lot poppier than the
"members of" list and the artwork would have you believe, but if
you're into the super melodic end of recent Spanish-language punk give
this a try.

Mindless: Planet of Pestilence 7" (To Live a Lie)
New 7" from this Texas band featuring members of Hatred Surge. Like
HS, this exists on that fine line between hardcore and metal. The
production is very modern and metallic, bringing to mind newer stuff
like Integrity, but the approach is more basic, viscereal, and
undeniably hardcore. I could see fans of newer hardcore like Weekend
Nachos also digging this.

Draize: S/T 7" (Bad Teeth)
Debut 7" (I think?) by this Boston hardcore band. Definitely on the
tougher end of things, this has the metallic punk of something like
Madball, but it's so downtuned and aggressive that it almost gets into
like Crown of Thornz territory or something like that, but thankfully
you won't find any rapping here... just super tough, metallic
hardcore.

Glow God: House of Distractions 12" (Play Pinball)
Debut LP from this new Texas band featuring one of the guys from
Video, Wiccans, and Wax Museums. This is a very different sound,
though... straight up catchy, heavy-as-hell 90s-style noise rock. This
is definitely on the poppier end of that sound, recalling prime-era
Nirvana more than, say, the Melvins or Unsane. There's still tons of
bottom end and punk propulsion, but the songs are mega catchy... at
times it reminds me quite a bit of early Mudhoney, but heavier. There
are also moments of real beauty here, almost recalling the melodic
whirr of My Bloody Valentine. A great LP from a label that has not
done us wrong yet!

White Murder: S/T 12" (Razorcake)
After a couple of great self-released EPs, here's the debut 12" from
White Murder. This is just some great, classically-styled melodic punk
in the vein of stuff that Dangerhouse used to put out. Unlike a lot of
bands who have kind of a 70s punk vibe, it's clear that White Murder
aren't trying to cop any one particular band's style... and indeed
they don't sound like any band in particular, but the approach of
playing great, anthemic songs with punk energy and aggression can't
help but make you think of bands like X and the Bags. This also really
feels like a proper LP... lots of varied tempos and ebb and flow keep
you interested throughout... it's a real ride. I can see this
appealing to anyone into '77 style punk, garage, or even hardcore as
it just has that classic punk sound that we all know and love.

Earth Girls: demo cassette (self-released)
Demo tape from this new Chicago band. Astute listeners will
immediately recognize the voice of Liz from Libyans / Siamese Twins,
but Earth Girls is a very different project. Unabashedly inspired by
the Marked Men, this is all jittery hit-hat rhythms and downbeat
power-pop riffs. Liz's songwriting chops are formidable, and boy are
they on display here... if you like Jeff Burke's songs in the Marked
Men and Radioactivity you need to get this. Strongly recommended.

Hi everyone and welcome to the Sorry State Records update for =
March!<br><br>
It's been kind of a weird couple of weeks for me. I got called in for jury =
duty a couple of weeks ago and I got put on the jury for a rather major =
crime. The trial is supposed to last up to two weeks, which means that I'm =
in court all day every day, and I'm only able to do label / shop stuff =
(not to mention my day job as a teacher!) when I get home at night. =
Unfortunately most of my energy has to go to behind-the-scenes things like =
accounting, ordering, responding to emails, and managing this list, so I =
haven't been able to work at the shop as much, and unfortunately I haven't =
been able to write descriptions for a lot of the new releases that have =
come in (and there are some great new ones I haven't even heard yet, like =
the new EPs from Mulltute and Damages, for instance). Fortunately, Jeff =
and Seth (as well as our new employee Alyssa) have been holding things =
down at the shop and making sure both the store and the mailorder are =
running smoothly, so hopefully no one out there has really noticed my =
absence.<br><br>
While I'm on the subject of my jury duty, there's another thing I wanted =
to mention. I can't really talk about the trial while it's going on, but =
it's for a series of really violent, nasty crimes that took place in my =
neighborhood. Hearing testimony from the victims and looking at the =
evidence (including numerous graphic photos) has really gotten me thinking =
about the fetishization of violent imagery and language in the punk scene. =
I don't necessarily have anything against this in principle, but it's =
strange to hear words like "assault," "brutality," "rage," etc. bandied =
about in one context in my punk life, then to see their very real and =
chilling effects on real people in my very own neighborhood. I don't =
really have a thesis here, I just wanted to share that it's something I'm =
thinking about it, and maybe it might give people pause about the ways =
they use these terms and images.<br><br>
Alright, now that that's out of the way we can get back to the fun stuff. =
The cassette releases that I mentioned last update (Skem&auml;ta and =
Narcoman) are coming along nicely. Both have been sent off for duplication =
and we're currently finishing up the artwork, so hopefully we're still on =
track for a mid-March release date for both of these. Still no new vinyl =
planned at the moment, but we have a lot of things in the incubation =
stage, so there will be plenty more news from Sorry State in 2014.<br><br>
Oh, and a couple of notes for those of you in and around North =
Carolina:<br><br>
It's been a particularly sick month for used records at the shop... if =
you're getting your tax return or some other windfall it's a good time to =
visit the shop. And if you're wondering what's been coming in or if you're =
just into looking at pictures of killer records, you should be sure to =
follow us on Instagram <a href=3D"http://t.ymlp224.net/ubhacaumhehafauqeax=
aeuem/click.php">@sorrystate</a>.<br><br>
Also, later this month (the 23rd to be precise) I'm booking a show for =
Boston's Casanovas in Heat. Here's a pic of the poster I made:<br><br>
<img border=3D0 width=3D"480" height=3D"640" src=3D"http://farm8.staticfli=
ckr.com/7422/12909767213_22b8dd7f14_z.jpg"><br><br>
And here's a link to the Facebook event with all of the details: <a =
href=3D"http://t.ymlp224.net/ubwanaumhehaxauqeacaeuem/click.php">https://w=
ww.facebook.com/events/673254532731581/</a>.<br><br>
And of course if you're wondering what else is happening in the area, you =
should probably be checking out the new local message board, <a =
href=3D"http://t.ymlp224.net/ubqadaumhehazauqeafaeuem/click.php">Distort =
Raleigh</a>, on a regular basis.

Hey Sorry State subscribers!
I feel like this past month has been great for new releases.
I can't recommend enough the Funeral Parade 12" EP!
Kinda gothy, dark post-punk, super good!
I recently found out that I think the tracks on the LP are remastered =
versions of a demo from 2010, but I'm just now hearing it and it's great.
Also really been digging the Damages Reality Disease 7", the Pig//Control =
Trauma 7" is really great, M&uuml;llt&uuml;te's 3rd EP, Unknown to God 7", =
and not surprisingly, I love the Dissekerad LP (members of =
Totalit&auml;r!).
On a less hardcore note, the White Murder 12" and the new Earth Girls demo =
are awesome!
There's a bunch of others too that I'm probably forgetting...<br><br>
On a more personal note I've got some stuff with my bands coming =
up:<br><br>
Mercy Killings is playing a few shows at the end of March in Atlanta, =
Charlotte, and a couple other places.
Also, we're playing the Saturday show at Damaged City fest in DC, so I'm =
stoked about that!<br><br>
Also, I've got a new band called Skem&auml;ta with Alex who was in =
Stripmines with me and Cameron from Logic Problem/Double =
Negative/alotofotherbands.
I'm really excited about it, and we're hoping play outside of NC more =
pretty soon.
Also, our demo tape should be out Sorry State really soon!<br><br>
Talk to everybody next month!<br>
-Jeff

My big pick for this month is definitely the hysterics 7".
I had heard a couple of things about this band but never got around to =
checking it out.
This record is amazing though.
It's fast and angry with a lot of punk attitude.
Also like Jeff I've been into the funeral parade 12" and the Earth Girls =
demo.
<br><br>
In other news my band Black Zinfandel finally had demo tapes for sale. =
Almost 2 years and we have finally gotten around to that.
I'll hopefully have some on the online store next week, so keep an eye =
out.
If you like dirty garage punk check it out.
We're playing around the triangle some this month. Check <a =
href=3D"http://t.ymlp224.net/ubyagaumhehavauqeadaeuem/click.php">Facebook.=
com/blackzinfandel</a> for when and where.
Also mystic inane from New Orleans will be playing at nice price records =
on the 30th of march with Drag Sounds from Greensboro and Magic Attic, =
which is the new band of Scott Williams of Double Negative and Sean of
Shoxx and Pollution. Should be a great show to end the month.

So, like I said I haven't gotten as much listening time in this month as I =
would prefer, but I am really, really psyched to hear that Mulltute EP... =
they're one of the best current bands in Europe in my opinion, and Jeff =
assures me that the new EP is even better than the last one... fans of =
Amde Petersen's Arme take note! Along with the Mulltute 7" we also got a =
bunch of other releases from Heart First records, including restocks of =
tough to find records by Kriegshog and Vaaska. As for other stuff, I have =
to reiterate Seth's recommendation of the new Hysterics EP... they were my =
favorite band at Damaged City Fest last year, and the new EP absolutely =
destroys... total Void vibes, but without sounding like a tribute act at =
all. The new Fugitive Family EP is also excellent. Featuring the creative =
core of the terribly-underrated Reason of Insanity, this is similarly =
face-melting. As for LPs, the Glow God and White Murder records are both =
fantastic in completely different ways, and I'm also loving the Earth =
Girls demo, wherein Liz from Libyans / Broken Prayer / Siamese Twins shows =
off her poppier side.<br><br>
In addition to these new releases, we also got in TONS of classic punk =
titles... you can see the full list below, but there's lots of stuff we =
haven't carried before, like almost all of the early <i>Killed by =
Death</i> and <i>Bloodstains</i> comps, most of the Naked Raygun catalog, =
the UK Subhumans, as well as tons of stuff from heavier labels like Season =
of Mist and Death Wish.<br><br>
Also, the descriptions will be on the next update, but we just had a slew =
of new releases come in today, like the much-anticipated Warthog EP, the =
new releases on Ugly Pop (Bent Wind and Thor's Hammer LPs) and numerous =
others! Those should be on the site by the time you read this.<br><br>

The Real Energy: <i>Beyond Delay</i> 12" (Erste Theke Tontrager)<br>
New 12" from this Houston bands featuring members of No Talk, Secret =
Prostitutes, Reason of Insanity, and many more I'm sure. Of course all of =
those bands have a very different sound from one another, and the Real =
Energy is no different. They remind me of the more rock-oriented '77 UK =
punk bands like 999 and the UK Subs... the songs are high-energy and =
definitely punk, but there's a kind of classic rock songwriting =
sensibility on display that not a lot of bands can pull off. Basically, =
this is just high-energy rock and roll with classic hooks, not pandering =
to any particular vibe like '77 retro or garage rock... you don't hear =
many bands like this and it totally rages.<br><br>

The Electric Vomit: S/T 7" (Garbage Bag)<br>
Archival release from this obscure Montreal band who I don't believe =
released anything during their original run, but one of the members went =
on to form the (terribly underrated) Nils. As for this, it's totally =
awesome. I love punk from this era when it sounds like the Sex Pistols are =
pretty much their only and exclusive model for what punk is. The vocals =
are so Rotten-inspired their almost an imitation, and the music is sort of =
inept, three-chord punk, but with a real sense of swagger. The three songs =
here are perhaps a little goofy, but if you dig the sort of first-wave of =
punk diaspora or KBD stuff this is well worth hearing. Oh, and by the way =
this release came out like 10 years ago or something and these are a =
recently-recovered batch of dead stock copies, not likely to be restocked =
again.<br><br>

style=3D"padding-left: 5px" width=3D"175">
Solitary Confinement: demo cassette (Mind Rot)<br>
Demo tape from this new band out of Virginia Beach, VA. This definitely =
fits in with the current wave of oi!-tinged HC bands like Violent =
Reaction, Violent Future, etc.... simple riffs, tough vocals, and kind of =
a stomping rhythm alternating with fast, Negative Approach-inspired parts. =
Negative Approach and Last Rights are probably the best older band =
comparisons as well, as this has some really solid, raw but not overly raw =
production that makes it hit super hard. Basically, if you like any of the =
bands mentioned here you'll be feeling this.<br><br>

Forward / Teargas: Split 7" (Hardcore Victim)<br>
Split 7" released for these two bands' joint Australian tour. Forward =
contribute two tracks and they continue the tear they've been on with =
their recent slate of releases, all of which I have though were top-notch =
and above the best in their discography. As for Teargas, they're clearly =
heavily Burning Spirits-inspired, but their ripping leads have more of the =
epic sweep of Death Side... a pretty darn killer split 7".<br><br>
<img border=3D0 height=3D"175" src=3D"http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/025=

style=3D"padding-left: 5px" width=3D"175">
Last Chaos / Vaarallinen: Split 7" (Hardcore Victim)<br>
Split 7" from these two bands that I think might have toured together =
recently? Last Chaos are from Brisbane, Australia and play Destino =
Final-inspired d-beat hardcore with delay on the vox. They are a bit =
faster than your typical d-beat band, running along at more of an early =
Finnish HC-type clip, which gives their contribution that extra little =
edge of rage it needs. As for Vaarallinen, they're from the unlikely =
locale of Singapore and they're also inspired by the sounds of early =
Finnish HC, but they have a more straightforward sound that reminds me a =
bit of Kieltolaki.<br><br>
<img border=3D0 height=3D"175" src=3D"http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/025=

style=3D"padding-right: 5px" width=3D"175">
Unknown to God: S/T 7" (Hardcore Victim)<br>
New 7" from this Australian band who had a previous split 7" with fellow =
Aussies Death Cage. Clearly inspired by Japanese HC, this is all epic =
riffs and throat-gargling vox... fans of Death Side, Crude, Bastard, etc. =
need apply.<br><br>

style=3D"padding-left: 5px" width=3D"175">
Havittajat: S/T 7" (Hardcore Victim)<br>
Seems like the Finnish sound is a bit in vogue in Australia right now... =
this new Melbourne band features members of Kromosom and Leprosy and plays =
vicious, 1-2 1-2 hardcore that sounds more than a little bit like S/T =
LP-era Rattus and early Terveet Kadet. Perfect production on this one also =
puts it over the top... definitely my favorite out of the latest batch of =
Hardcore Victim releases!<br><br>

Hysterics: <i>Can't I Live?</i> 7" (M'Lady's)<br>
2nd EP from this GREAT all-lady band from Olympia, WA. I've been somewhat =
obsessed with this band since seeing them at last year's Damaged City =
Fest, where they were easily the best band of the weekend. This EP =
absolutely lives up to those expectations... it's just total =
Dischord-style, with wild, Void-esque guitar, primitive hardcore rhythms, =
and some of the most authoritative vocals in punk. Seriously, this could =
be the hardcore EP of the year... highest possible recommendation GET ON =
IT!<br><br>

style=3D"padding-left: 5px" width=3D"175">
Fugitive Family: <i>Putrid Remains</i> 7" (Psycho Wolf)<br>
Debut 7" from this new band featuring Josh and Howie from Reason of =
Insanity... Josh also plays in Secret Prostitutes, the Energy, No Talk and =
tons of other Texas bands if that does something for you. Anyway, ROI is =
one of the most criminally underrated bands out there, and Fugitive Family =
is appropriately raging... it's a little more mid-paced and locked-in than =
ROI's more frantic sound (particularly on the b-side, which is almost like =
a harder Secret Prostitutes-type song), but still definitely super =
hardcore and the riffs are incredibly inventive and powerful. This is just =
a perfect, spot-on hardcore record that will restore your faith in the =
genre. Highly recommended.<br><br>

Dissekerad: S/T 12" (Man in Decline)<br>
US pressing of this Swedish monster. If Institution didn't scratch your =
itch for members of Totlitar playing Totalitar-style hardcore (actually =
Poffen sings for both bands) then this certainly well. Actually, I think I =
vastly prefer this LP to Institution's stuff. It's a little more <i>Sin =
Egan Motstandare</i> than <i>Vi Ar Eliten</i>... it's a little rawer, a =
little more unhinged, but still has that classic Totalitar sound and vibe. =
People have been freaking out about this LP, and rightly so... if you dig =
this style you aren't going to do any better than this. =
Recommended.<br><br>

Wrench: demo 2013 cassette (Criminal Rights)<br>
Another day, another ripping demo out of the UK. This time the band is =
Wrench, and they play tough, nasty hardcore with a bit of the skinhead HC =
sound that's in vogue these days... definitely some early Agnostic Front =
vibes here, but I'm guessing these guys have a few Painkiller Records =
releases in their collection as well. Regardless, this is some mean, nasty =
and rough hardcore with just the right amount of rawness in the recording. =
A ripper.<br><br>

Anti-Zen: S/T cassette (Hesitation Wound)<br>
Demo tape from this killer new band who hail from DC I believe. Fast, =
primitive hardcore with high-pitched lady vox that recall Criaturas or La =
Misma. The music has this real wall of sound quality, particularly to the =
heavy, distorted bass sound, that sounds very much like 80s Japanese =
hardcore, but more pre-Burning Spirits-type stuff... the music is fast and =
simple, but all the catchier and more powerful for it. A total ripper of a =
demo.<br><br>

Chain Gang Grave: demo cassette (self-released)<br>
Demo tape from this new band from Brooklyn, NY. I really like this band's =
sound... it's sort of in this little groove between hardcore and =
post-punk. I feel like some songs and parts are definitely Fall-inspired, =
but it's harder, faster, and heavier than most bands who ply that sounds. =
I could see this appealing to fans of bands like Protomartyr or Whatever =
Brains as well as more forward-thinking, kind of noise rock-ish hardcore =
bands like Pollution as well. Killer demo.<br><br>

Jerk Store #13 zine<br>
Latest issue of this top-notch Australian zine. Features writings about =
1981, a Daylight Robbery tour diary, a bunch of spot-on, incredibly =
well-written record reviews and a lot of other content for the discerning =
punk. I love that Alex has really diverse yet demanding tastes, and I =
think it's safe to say that if you're into what Sorry State does =
(particularly on the label end of things) this should be one of your =
must-read zines.<br><br>

Various: <i>To Live a Lie Records Volume II</i> 12" (To Live a Lie)<br>
This is on To Live a Lie, so you know what you're getting... full-bore =
power violence. Like the label itself, this features a solid mix of =
better-known and completely unknown bands, with a couple of Raleigh groups =
thrown in for good measure. Features songs from Lapse, Abuse., Rabid Pigs, =
Water Torture, Low Threat Profile, Terminal Crisis, Beartrap, Mad Dog, =
Congenital Death, Hummingbird of Death, Grit, Bridge, Sick/Tired, Callous, =
Chest Pain, Vaccine, xswampx, Sidetracked, Weekend Nachos, Scalped, =
Impulse, Vile Intent, False Light, Cheap Art, To the Point, Super Mutant, =

Decreneo: S/T 12" (MMM)<br>
Debut LP from this band from Mallorca, Spain. Like a lot of my favorite =
recent Spanish-language punk (La Misma, Silla Electrica) this is built =
around kind of bouncy pogo-punk beats and features vicious, yelping lady =
vox a la the Comes. There is a hair of rock-n-roll edge to the guitar =
playing here as well, recalling the Eskorbuto-influenced stylings of =
Ruleta Rusa and Peligro Social, but mostly this is just vicious, catchy =
1-2-1-2 punk... totally killer!<br><br>

Alarms: <i>Millipede</i> 12" (Landlocked Collective)<br>
Debut LP from this Sacramento band who have had a couple of splits and EP =
releases. The sound here is an interesting amalgam of rock, metal, and =
hardcore. I'm reminded a little bit of Never Healed, but this is a little =
more rocked out. It's sort of if you took the sound of <i>Wolverine =
Blues</i>-era Entombed and added just a little bit more tough hardcore =
into the mix.<br><br>

Suicidas: <i>No Mas Mata La Muerte</i> 7" (No Nostalgia)<br>
2nd 7" from this Spanish band who feature members of Destino Final and =
Belgrado, but these guys play a much poppier sound. There's a lot of the =
downbeat, melodic punk style of La Urss and Insomnio, with big melodic =
vocals that are almost radio-friendly. Fans of Boom Boom Kid would also =
dig this I think... definitely a lot poppier than the "members of" list =
and the artwork would have you believe, but if you're into the super =
melodic end of recent Spanish-language punk give this a try.<br><br>

Mindless: <i>Planet of Pestilence</i> 7" (To Live a Lie)<br>
New 7" from this Texas band featuring members of Hatred Surge. Like HS, =
this exists on that fine line between hardcore and metal. The production =
is very modern and metallic, bringing to mind newer stuff like Integrity, =
but the approach is more basic, viscereal, and undeniably hardcore. I =
could see fans of newer hardcore like Weekend Nachos also digging =
this.<br><br>

Draize: S/T 7" (Bad Teeth)<br>
Debut 7" (I think?) by this Boston hardcore band. Definitely on the =
tougher end of things, this has the metallic punk of something like =
Madball, but it's so downtuned and aggressive that it almost gets into =
like Crown of Thornz territory or something like that, but thankfully you =
won't find any rapping here... just super tough, metallic =
hardcore.<br><br>

Glow God: <i>House of Distractions</i> 12" (Play Pinball)<br>
Debut LP from this new Texas band featuring one of the guys from Video, =
Wiccans, and Wax Museums. This is a very different sound, though... =
straight up catchy, heavy-as-hell 90s-style noise rock. This is definitely =
on the poppier end of that sound, recalling prime-era Nirvana more than, =
say, the Melvins or Unsane. There's still tons of bottom end and punk =
propulsion, but the songs are mega catchy... at times it reminds me quite =
a bit of early Mudhoney, but heavier. There are also moments of real =
beauty here, almost recalling the melodic whirr of My Bloody Valentine. A =
great LP from a label that has not done us wrong yet!<br><br>

White Murder: S/T 12" (Razorcake)<br>
After a couple of great self-released EPs, here's the debut 12" from White =
Murder. This is just some great, classically-styled melodic punk in the =
vein of stuff that Dangerhouse used to put out. Unlike a lot of bands who =
have kind of a 70s punk vibe, it's clear that White Murder aren't trying =
to cop any one particular band's style... and indeed they don't sound like =
any band in particular, but the approach of playing great, anthemic songs =
with punk energy and aggression can't help but make you think of bands =
like X and the Bags. This also really feels like a proper LP... lots of =
varied tempos and ebb and flow keep you interested throughout... it's a =
real ride. I can see this appealing to anyone into '77 style punk, garage, =
or even hardcore as it just has that classic punk sound that we all know =
and love.<br><br>

Earth Girls: demo cassette (self-released)<br>
Demo tape from this new Chicago band. Astute listeners will immediately =
recognize the voice of Liz from Libyans / Siamese Twins, but Earth Girls =
is a very different project. Unabashedly inspired by the Marked Men, this =
is all jittery hit-hat rhythms and downbeat power-pop riffs. Liz's =
songwriting chops are formidable, and boy are they on display here... if =
you like Jeff Burke's songs in the Marked Men and Radioactivity you need =
to get this. Strongly recommended.<br><br>
