Hello List-
Here are listings as of 7/4/12

Listings Project Story of the Week:

Just reading the beautiful note and connecting with the author, we found ou=
t that
the Listings Project is connecting creative minds globally in a very simila=
r way
 to PointB Worklodge bringing people together around a shared experience.

"Dearest Karin,

Simply writing to express, from an architectural artist mind relocating fro=
m Chicago,
that the space you have listed on Stephanie Diamond is a stunner. There is =
so much
'chaos' found within nyc listings. So, to find something aesthetically and =
mindfully
crafted, is a great treat!

All the best,

Carla Duarte"

Great minds think alike! Thank you Stephanie and thank you Carla for making=
 our=20
day.
Karin Laansoo

right  across the road from Brooklyn natural, Roberta's, cafes, liquor stor=

Available for part-time share. The "share" is a time/desk-share concept;  I=
 work
 during the week and only use my space (the room is shared with  with two o=
ther=20
female artists in their mid-late 20's)  a few evenings  per week and saturd=
ay. You
would have my section of the studio and desk  space (pictured) all day mon-=
friday
and Sundays. This is flexible  depending on your needs.
My studio mates are very cool and relaxed and are usually only there in  th=
e evenings.
Given that we would be sharing the same desk and area, the  situation would=
 work
 best with someone who works relatively small and  clean, and does not need=
 much
 storage space or gear.

Bronx, $650 per month, Mott Haven, 11' 5 x 10', Seeking responsible, non-sm=
oking
 roommate to share apt
Available: July 2012 through flexible
Seeking a responsible, quiet, non-smoking roommate to share an  apartment, =
in a=20
building renovated in the 90's (this means no lead  paint!), located in the=
 very
 South, South Bronx, one subway stop above  125th St station in Harlem on t=
he east
side lines. It can be very fast  to get to Union Square at certain times of=
 day,
 20 - 25 minutes. Also,  to let you know, a friendly calico cat lives here.
A friend describes the apt as "so big and divided up well for two  people",=
 which
is true, it is a true two bedroom and affords lots of  privacy. Because thi=
s area
is off the trend radar, it is a relative  bargain for NYC. This is also a v=
ery diverse
neighborhood, you will meet  people from all walks of life here. There is a=
lso a
 small art community  here, including some great neighbors downstairs and a=
round
 the corner.  The room itself is quiet because it faces the back, and can b=
e furnished
 or unfurnished, whichever you prefer. There is a very large closet in  the=
 room.
You would be sharing the apartment with just one other person - myself. I  =
am 36,
have lived in NYC for a long time, and mostly freelance and do  my own art =
projects.
My work is mostly site-specific conceptual work,  with elements of performa=
nce,=20
photography, and video mixed in, not the  traditional studio-based practice=
, so=20
you will not find me painting at  home or anything like that. In the last f=
ew months,
mostly I have been  biking around locally to get stuff done, or out via sub=
way or
metro  north. But sometimes I am home, tied to the computer, working on  ap=
plications
and paperwork. And sometimes I travel out of town for art  projects, so it =
is possible
you may end up feeding and watering the cat,  she will appreciate it. I wil=
l be=20
away during the last two weeks of  July.
While not entirely vegetarian, I do subscribe to the local CSA for farm  ve=
getables
from June - October, and this bounty is shared!
First month's rent plus one month's rent as deposit ($1300 total) is  requi=
red to
move in. To keep it simple, all utilities, including  wireless internet, ar=
e included
in the rent. AC use is encouraged during  the summer, artwork in storage in=
 the=20
apartment will last longer this  way, and we will be happier, too.
If you are interested, drop me a line and let me know a little about  yours=
elf,=20
and we can schedule a meeting. If you've written before, but  were still ou=
t of=20
town, please feel free to write again. I am posting  again because my last =
roommate
was only here working on projects in nyc  for the month of June and is retu=
rning
 to Detroit. Feel free to write  with questions, too.

$600 per month, Brooklyn, New Brooklyn Cooperative Looking for Members
Available: August 1 through Forever
A new cooperative living project is being started here in New York and  we =
are looking
for potential roommates/family members! Cooperative  living is an arrangeme=
nt based
on the principles of living like an  intentional community. Though each mem=
ber of
the co-op can have their  own space, we share expenses, responsibilities, a=
nd talents
with each  other. This can manifest itself in regular house dinners, dividi=
ng  household
work, and doing things as a community like yoga, gardening,  cooking, movie=
-culture
nights, etc.
This is a brand new project looking to begin in August and start from  the =
ground
up. We are simultaneously searching for a living space and  roommates, so t=
here=20
are no details set in stone. Currently, we are  looking for places in Brook=
lyn,=20
but that is subject to change.
Who are we?
Sara- Philadelphia-native visual artist and Special Education teacher,  lov=
er of
 gardening, cooking, and everything DIY. Looking forward to  creating commu=
nity=20
space in the big city.
Bebhinn- A Teaching Fellow originally from Virginia who specializes in  wan=
derlusting.
An avid traveler, yogi of sorts, and vegetarian  extraordinaire, she is alw=
ays up
for an adventure.
Teresa- California-bred film lover and ESL teacher. New York neophyte  exci=
ted to
explore the city via bike and any other means possible.
What are we looking for in a co-op member?
This cooperative is a welcoming space that does not discriminate on  basis =
of sex,
race, color, creed, sexuality, gender identity, or  anything of the sort. W=
e are
 hoping to attract folks who are interested  in conscious, healthy lifestyl=
es. Terms
that often describe this are  environmentalist, activist, volunteer, open-m=
inded
 individual, lover (as  opposed to hater), and the creative type. We welcom=
e those
from all  different backgrounds and hope to create a diverse community of p=
eople
  with a variety of skills that we can share with each other.
Sidenote: Best possible scenario includes long-term renters aka. willing  t=
o join
for a year. We will consider subletters if we feel the need  come August.
About the space:
We are currently on the lookout for a place to call home and will most  lik=
ely situate
ourselves in Brooklyn. Of course, this is not set it  stone, but is the mos=
t-likely
scenario. Ideally, we will find a house or  loft with 5-6 bedrooms to start=
 our=20
cooperative out small but mighty.  If in the next year we thrive as a group=
, we=20
will consider expanding for  the future. You can expect to have a room to y=
ourself,
but if you are  open to sharing a space with another for reduced rent, we c=
an be
  flexible.
Interested?
If you are interested in joining our growing community, please send us an e=
-mail
 answering the following questions:
Name:
Age:
Preferred gender pronouns:
Tell us a bit about yourself:
Why do you want to live in a cooperative environment?
Have you previously lived cooperatively?
What talents and/or skills do you have to offer this community(be creative!=
)?
Do you have dietary preferences/restrictions/allergies?
Are you willing to cook/eat vegan meals for or with the group?
Do you have a stable source of income? If so, what is it?
As a cooperative, we all share chores and household responsibilities.  Are =
there
 any tasks that you are specifically inclined to do? Or those  that you abs=
olutely
will not do?
Anything else you would like to tell us?
** Rent price is still unknown- we're aiming for least expensive option we =
can find

$800 per month, Crown Heights, 11.5" x 9.5", Nice roomie wanted!
Available: August 1 through Oct 31 or longer
Hello, there.
I have one room available in a four-bedroom apartment in Crown Heights, Bro=
oklyn.
The apartment is quite lovely. I, in collaboration with current and  former=
 tenants,
have put a lot of love and care into constructing a  restful and inviting p=
lace=20
to call home. We offer a well-stocked kitchen  and homemade 7' dining room =
table
 for meals, big and small. It's on the  fourth floor of a pre-war-feeling w=
alk-up
with hardwood floors and tons  of natural light.
The three other roommates are 20s/30s, employed and nice. We do things  ind=
ependently
as well as together from time to time. We collectively own  over a dozen in=
struments,
including an 88-key keyboard and an  assortment of stringed things. We all =
work=20
9-5ish and the household  activities accommodate those hours accordingly.
I am looking for a tidy and friendly person for August 1 -- October 31  wit=
h the
 potential to renew. Preference goes to those with a Kitchen  Aid, a collec=
tion=20
of plants, and/or a love of bell hooks.
Thanks for reading!

I'm looking for a roommate. I have a room available in my 2 bedroom  apartm=

It is not a big room, 7' x 12', but there is enough space for  a dresser, d=

 I have a bookcase you can use, and  my current roommate needs to sell the =

$125), I can put you in  touch with him.  No pets allowed in the building. =
 There

Good luck.

$533 per month, Prospect Lefferts Gardens, 153 sf, 3 BR avail in creative, =
queer-friendly
10BR Colonial Mansion, $460-650
Available: August 1 through flexible
Hey, we're a gender-diverse group living in a shared 10-BR home &  creative=
 space
in Lefferts Gardens: NoHomme (pronounced "no home"). The  house itself is a=
n outrageously
spacious, beautiful old three-story  Colonial Revival mansion located one a=
nd a=20
half blocks from Prospect  Park and the eponymous subway station housing th=
e B,=20
Q, and S trains. It  features three floors, each equipped with its own kitc=
hen and
bathroom,  a large first floor living space and dining hall (two rooms!), f=
ree =20
washer/dryer access and a resplendent patio/yard space outside with some  s=
craggly-but-promising
garden boxes we put in back in March. We aren't a  co-op, but the property =
is large
enough that we aspire to implement  more dynamic chore wheels to divide up =
cleaning
responsibilities.  Reliable, queer(-friendly) folks who are comfortable wit=
h this
kind of  situation would likely be good fits. Several us do some work from =
home,
  so we generally appreciate calm-ish environs. However, we host  occasiona=
l house
music shows, so new housemates should be down with this  prospect. We curre=
ntly=20
share the house with one sweet cat, George, but  sadly cannot have other pe=
ts join
us !
The SPEX: There are a handful of rooms opening up on the third floor of NoH=
omme=20
on August 1.
One is a 11' x 15' room in the center of the third floor ($650). It has a  =
charming
attick-y vibe, a window on the side, and is a pretty decent  size. (note: I=
t provides
the only attic access in the house, so we'll  have to be able to get up in =
there
 every once in a while.)
The other two bedrooms are a railroad suite in the front of the house.  The=
re is
 a door in the hallway that leads to the first room (12' x 14',  $460), whi=
ch contains
a door leading to the second room (9' x 14', plus  closet, $490). So, you h=
ave to
walk through the first room to get to the  second room. Together, they woul=
d be=20
ideal for a couple, a coupla BFFs,  siblings, or an individual who might li=
ke some
extra space for a clean  studio or whatnot. The light in this region of the=
 house
is wonderful,  and these spots are cozy. Also, our current housemates are m=
oving
 back  to France and would love to sell the furniture in this to new  house=
mates,
if you're looking for a furnished place/need a bed/don't  wanna haul as muc=
h - -
 not mandatory by any means, but an option.
The kitchen on the third floor is lovely, spacious, full of light and a  vi=
ew of
 the backyard. New folks upstairs will share the utilities up  there with t=
he delightful
Monroe (musician, sweetest smartass ever &  great at busting out the kale s=
tir fry...more
on the rest of us to be  continued).
Because the house is classified as a single-family dwelling, we are  respon=
sible
 for heating expenses, resulting in utility costs that are a  bit on the hi=
gh side
(about $75 by month per person on average - this  has been virtually nil la=
tely,
 but fairly high in the winter). Move-in  costs will total two months' rent=
: first
month plus one month as a  security deposit. Move in is August 1. Our curre=
nt lease
goes through  Oct 31, but we anticipate staying on longer. We're open to sh=
orter
 term  and month-to-month arrangements as well.
Thanks for reading! If you wanna show n tell, send some words about you, to=
 me.

ROOMS FOR SUBLET

$750 per month, Sunset Park, Large, light-filled room with attached office =
space,
in a beautiful old row house.
Available: 7/8/12 through 8/31/12
I'm looking for 2 roommates for my spacious, 2-floor Sunset Park  apartment=
, for
 July 8-Aug 31 (with that period somewhat negotiable).   The ideal candidat=
es would
be a couple, but there are 2 rooms available,  so two separate roommates wo=
uld work
too.
There are two rooms available - one humongous one with tons of light  (and =
a smaller
room attached), and another much smaller (but therefore  cheaper) one.  If =
a couple
were to move in, they would have the use of  the smaller bedroom as well (a=
s another
office, for instance).
The rent for the small room is $500/month, and the larger one is $750  (les=
s 25%
 for July, since the rooms aren't available until July 8th).   For a couple=
 however,
the rent would be $625 each (i.e., a total of  $1250).
Located in Sunset Park, the apartment is beautiful and very large. I  live =
on the
top two floors of a ca. 1900 brownstone. There are 3  bedrooms & a bathroom=
 upstairs
and a truly palatial downstairs with  kitchen, dining room, living room, an=
d office
(includes high-speed  internet access). The house is on a residential stree=
t in=20
a safe  neighborhood, 4 blocks from an R subway stop, one stop from the exp=
ress=20
D  & N trains. During the day and evening, you can get to midtown in  about=
 35 minutes.
I have two cats, so feline-tolerance is a must.
Sunset Park is located between Red Hook & Bay Ridge along the  harbor, on t=
he D/N
Express line, R local. It's adjacent to Park Slope  with a bus running betw=
een them
down 5th Avenue. The neighborhood is  predominantly Mexican, and is next to=
 Brooklyn's
Chinatown. Needless to  say there is tremendous food: great tacos, best tam=
ale stand
in the  city, an excellent Vietnamese sandwich shop, dim sum, and Sichuan. =
We're
  4 blocks from a big park with an Olympic-size swimming pool, a half  bloc=
k from
a large laundromat, and near the Greenwood Cemetery, among  other nice thin=
gs.

Laundry, lovely boutiques, and excellent grocery stores and restaurants  ar=

$1000 per month, Gowanus/Park Slope, Summer Sublet in beautiful large loft =
with=20
private rooftop garden
Available: July 1, 2012 through August 31, 2012 (dates flexible)
This apt is conveniently located between Park Slope and Carroll Gardens.
The apt is a one of a kind 3rd floor 3 bedroom/1 bathroom loft space  with =
a 500sq.ft
private rooftop garden. Renovated kitchen with new  cabinets, stone counter=
s, gas
stove, dishwasher and large cooking island  that opens to a spacious living=
 room
 with a working fire place  (probably won't be using that this summer, but =
still
 a plus). There's a  washer/dryer located in a separate laundry closet. Spi=
ral staircase
 leads to the rooftop garden with great views of Manhattan and Brooklyn -  =
it is
 amazing in the day and extra special in the evening.  We have our  own ent=
rance
 on the second floor, which allows room for bikes.  Apt has  hardwood floor=
s, exposed
brick and built-in shelves throughout.  The  room available has space for a=
 queen
bed and a dresser and cost includes  all utilities and internet.
We just moved in July 1, so the furniture seen in the photos is from the  p=
rior=20
tenant, but there is tons of space if you have things you would  like to br=
ing along.
You'd be sharing the space with two women in their early thirties - one  ch=
ef who
own's her own catering business and one landscape architect.   We are both =
fun,=20
easy-going, clean and respectful of the space.  We are  looking for the sam=
e - someone
fun and independent who would love to  have a glass of wine with us on the =
roof=20
every now and then, but is also  respectful of a shared home.  It is indeed=
 a beautiful
apt and would be  a great summer home.
Queer friendly home with two cats, but unfortunately we can't allow any mor=
e pets.

SEEKING APARTMENTS AND ROOMS

Triangle Artists Workshop seeks housing for thirty artists, close to Dumbo,=
 2 weeks
Needed: Sept 15 -30, 2012
Triangle  Artists Workshop celebrates its thirtieth anniversary in  2012, a=
nd will
 host thirty artists from twenty-two countries in an  intensive two-week  s=
tudio
 program this September in temporary studio  space in Dumbo. Among  the man=
y far-flung
nations represented, this year  will see first-time  participation by artis=
ts from
Yemen, Uzbekistan  and Ethiopia!
The  biggest single expense has almost always been providing  lodgings for =
 the=20
thirty selected artists for two-weeks. Gone are the  days when the  Brookly=
n Marriott
sponsored us with ten rooms  accommodating three  artists each for a deriso=
ry rate.
While we  don't dare to expect anyone to be able to provide such  accommoda=
tion=20
for  free these days, we are hoping that someone among  Stephanie Diamond's=
  enlightened
readership might have an affordable  solution, so that more  of the money w=
e have
painstakingly fund-raised  can be used to support  the program.
With artists often working  extremely long hours in the Dumbo  studios, the=
 only
 real criteria for  accommodation is that they would  need to be able to ge=
t there
relatively  easily from Dumbo, including at  ungodly hours. Accommodation f=
or all
of  the artists should be at a  small number of locations (up to three  max=
imum=20
- ideally at one  location).
Any suggestions or proposals will be very gladly accepted.
Thank you!

No solvents, toxins or oil paint :) Ideally,  the room will have ample ligh=

 willing to pay more for.
Cooking is something I greatly enjoy, since I often pack my own lunches  an=

all.
If you happen to have a room in a safe neighbourhood with good  transport, =
do contact

nx, $650 per month, Mott Haven, 11' 5 x 10', Seeking responsible, non-smoki=
ng roommate to share apt<br /> Available: July 2012 through flexible<br /><=
br /> Seeking a responsible, quiet, non-smoking roommate to share an  apart=
ment, in a building renovated in the 90's (this means no lead  paint!), loc=
ated in the very South, South Bronx, one subway stop above  125th St statio=
n in Harlem on the east side lines. It can be very fast  to get to Union Sq=
uare at certain times of day, 20 - 25 minutes. Also,  to let you know, a fr=
iendly calico cat lives here. <br /> <br /> A friend describes the apt as "=
so big and divided up well for two  people", which is true, it is a true tw=
o bedroom and affords lots of  privacy. Because this area is off the trend =
radar, it is a relative  bargain for NYC. This is also a very diverse neigh=
borhood, you will meet  people from all walks of life here. There is also a=
 small art community  here, including some great neighbors downstairs and a=
round the corner.  The room itself is quiet because it faces the back, and =
can be furnished  or unfurnished, whichever you prefer. There is a very lar=
ge closet in  the room.<br /> <br /> You would be sharing the apartment wit=
h just one other person - myself. I  am 36, have lived in NYC for a long ti=
me, and mostly freelance and do  my own art projects. My work is mostly sit=
e-specific conceptual work,  with elements of performance, photography, and=
 video mixed in, not the  traditional studio-based practice, so you will no=
t find me painting at  home or anything like that. In the last few months, =
mostly I have been  biking around locally to get stuff done, or out via sub=
way or metro  north. But sometimes I am home, tied to the computer, working=
 on  applications and paperwork. And sometimes I travel out of town for art=
  projects, so it is possible you may end up feeding and watering the cat, =
 she will appreciate it. I will be away during the last two weeks of  July.=
 <br /> <br /> While not entirely vegetarian, I do subscribe to the local C=
SA for farm  vegetables from June - October, and this bounty is shared! <br=
 /> <br /> First month's rent plus one month's rent as deposit ($1300 total=
) is  required to move in. To keep it simple, all utilities, including  wir=
eless internet, are included in the rent. AC use is encouraged during  the =
summer, artwork in storage in the apartment will last longer this  way, and=
 we will be happier, too. <br /> <br /> If you are interested, drop me a li=
ne and let me know a little about  yourself, and we can schedule a meeting.=
 If you've written before, but  were still out of town, please feel free to=
 write again. I am posting  again because my last roommate was only here wo=
rking on projects in nyc  for the month of June and is returning to Detroit=
. Feel free to write  with questions, too.<br /><br /> <a style=3D"color: b=

0 per month, Brooklyn, New Brooklyn Cooperative Looking for Members<br /> A=
vailable: August 1 through Forever<br /><br /> A new cooperative living pro=
ject is being started here in New York and  we are looking for potential ro=
ommates/family members! Cooperative  living is an arrangement based on the =
principles of living like an  intentional community. Though each member of =
the co-op can have their  own space, we share expenses, responsibilities, a=
nd talents with each  other. This can manifest itself in regular house dinn=
ers, dividing  household work, and doing things as a community like yoga, g=
ardening,  cooking, movie-culture nights, etc.<br /> <br /> This is a brand=
 new project looking to begin in August and start from  the ground up. We a=
re simultaneously searching for a living space and  roommates, so there are=
 no details set in stone. Currently, we are  looking for places in Brooklyn=
, but that is subject to change.<br /> <br /> Who are we?<br /> Sara- Phila=
delphia-native visual artist and Special Education teacher,  lover of garde=
ning, cooking, and everything DIY. Looking forward to  creating community s=
pace in the big city.<br /> Bebhinn- A Teaching Fellow originally from Virg=
inia who specializes in  wanderlusting. An avid traveler, yogi of sorts, an=
d vegetarian  extraordinaire, she is always up for an adventure.<br /> Tere=
sa- California-bred film lover and ESL teacher. New York neophyte  excited =
to explore the city via bike and any other means possible. <br /> <br /> Wh=
at are we looking for in a co-op member?<br /> This cooperative is a welcom=
ing space that does not discriminate on  basis of sex, race, color, creed, =
sexuality, gender identity, or  anything of the sort. We are hoping to attr=
act folks who are interested  in conscious, healthy lifestyles. Terms that =
often describe this are  environmentalist, activist, volunteer, open-minded=
 individual, lover (as  opposed to hater), and the creative type. We welcom=
e those from all  different backgrounds and hope to create a diverse commun=
ity of people  with a variety of skills that we can share with each other.<=
br /> <br /> Sidenote: Best possible scenario includes long-term renters ak=
a. willing  to join for a year. We will consider subletters if we feel the =
need  come August. <br /> <br /> About the space:<br /> We are currently on=
 the lookout for a place to call home and will most  likely situate ourselv=
es in Brooklyn. Of course, this is not set it  stone, but is the most-likel=
y scenario. Ideally, we will find a house or  loft with 5-6 bedrooms to sta=
rt our cooperative out small but mighty.  If in the next year we thrive as =
a group, we will consider expanding for  the future. You can expect to have=
 a room to yourself, but if you are  open to sharing a space with another f=
or reduced rent, we can be  flexible.<br /> <br /> Interested?<br /> <br />=
 If you are interested in joining our growing community, please send us an =
e-mail answering the following questions:<br /> <br /> Name:<br /> Age:<br =
/> Preferred gender pronouns:<br /> Tell us a bit about yourself:<br /> Why=
 do you want to live in a cooperative environment?<br /> Have you previousl=
y lived cooperatively?<br /> What talents and/or skills do you have to offe=
r this community(be creative!)?<br /> Do you have dietary preferences/restr=
ictions/allergies?<br /> Are you willing to cook/eat vegan meals for or wit=
h the group?<br /> Do you have a stable source of income? If so, what is it=
?<br /> As a cooperative, we all share chores and household responsibilitie=
s.  Are there any tasks that you are specifically inclined to do? Or those =
 that you absolutely will not do?<br /> Anything else you would like to tel=
l us?<br /> <br /> ** Rent price is still unknown- we're aiming for least e=
xpensive option we can find<br /><br /> Please contact Bebhinn Rae at <a st=

br /> I am an aspiring actress, so I work as a server and often come home l=
ate  and sleep in late. I'm pretty laid-back and friendly. I like to keep  =
things clean and on the organized side. I'm of the opinion that if  somethi=
ng needs to be done or cleaned, you do it and share the  responsibility.  I=
 want to share my home, with someone who's friendly,  responsible, consider=
ate, and sometimes make food together. Similar  interests would be nice but=
 not necessary. We would split utilities. I  have Internet but not cable TV=
. <br /> If you think this might be the right place for you please contact =
me and we'll set up a time for you to check out the space.<br /> Good luck.=

3 per month, Prospect Lefferts Gardens, 153 sf, 3 BR avail in creative, que=
er-friendly 10BR Colonial Mansion, $460-650<br /> Available: August 1 throu=
gh flexible<br /><br /> Hey, we're a gender-diverse group living in a share=
d 10-BR home &  creative space in Lefferts Gardens: NoHomme (pronounced "no=
 home"). The  house itself is an outrageously spacious, beautiful old three=
-story  Colonial Revival mansion located one and a half blocks from Prospec=
t  Park and the eponymous subway station housing the B, Q, and S trains. It=
  features three floors, each equipped with its own kitchen and bathroom,  =
a large first floor living space and dining hall (two rooms!), free  washer=
/dryer access and a resplendent patio/yard space outside with some  scraggl=
y-but-promising garden boxes we put in back in March. We aren't a  co-op, b=
ut the property is large enough that we aspire to implement  more dynamic c=
hore wheels to divide up cleaning responsibilities.  Reliable, queer(-frien=
dly) folks who are comfortable with this kind of  situation would likely be=
 good fits. Several us do some work from home,  so we generally appreciate =
calm-ish environs. However, we host  occasional house music shows, so new h=
ousemates should be down with this  prospect. We currently share the house =
with one sweet cat, George, but  sadly cannot have other pets join us !<br =
/> <br /> The SPEX: There are a handful of rooms opening up on the third fl=
oor of NoHomme on August 1.<br /> <br /> One is a 11' x 15' room in the cen=
ter of the third floor ($650). It has a  charming attick-y vibe, a window o=
n the side, and is a pretty decent  size. (note: It provides the only attic=
 access in the house, so we'll  have to be able to get up in there every on=
ce in a while.) <br /> <br /> The other two bedrooms are a railroad suite i=
n the front of the house.  There is a door in the hallway that leads to the=
 first room (12' x 14',  $460), which contains a door leading to the second=
 room (9' x 14', plus  closet, $490). So, you have to walk through the firs=
t room to get to the  second room. Together, they would be ideal for a coup=
le, a coupla BFFs,  siblings, or an individual who might like some extra sp=
ace for a clean  studio or whatnot. The light in this region of the house i=
s wonderful,  and these spots are cozy. Also, our current housemates are mo=
ving back  to France and would love to sell the furniture in this to new  h=
ousemates, if you're looking for a furnished place/need a bed/don't  wanna =
haul as much - - not mandatory by any means, but an option.<br /> <br /> Th=
e kitchen on the third floor is lovely, spacious, full of light and a  view=
 of the backyard. New folks upstairs will share the utilities up  there wit=
h the delightful Monroe (musician, sweetest smartass ever &  great at busti=
ng out the kale stir fry...more on the rest of us to be  continued).<br /> =
<br /> Because the house is classified as a single-family dwelling, we are =
 responsible for heating expenses, resulting in utility costs that are a  b=
it on the high side (about $75 by month per person on average - this  has b=
een virtually nil lately, but fairly high in the winter). Move-in  costs wi=
ll total two months' rent: first month plus one month as a  security deposi=
t. Move in is August 1. Our current lease goes through  Oct 31, but we anti=
cipate staying on longer. We're open to shorter term  and month-to-month ar=
rangements as well. <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading! If you wanna show n t=
ell, send some words about you, to me.<br /> <br /> also see: www.itaboy.or=

r /><br /> I'm looking for 2 roommates for my spacious, 2-floor Sunset Park=
  apartment, for July 8-Aug 31 (with that period somewhat negotiable).   Th=
e ideal candidates would be a couple, but there are 2 rooms available,  so =
two separate roommates would work too.<br /> <br /> There are two rooms ava=
ilable - one humongous one with tons of light  (and a smaller room attached=
), and another much smaller (but therefore  cheaper) one.  If a couple were=
 to move in, they would have the use of  the smaller bedroom as well (as an=
other office, for instance).<br /> <br /> The rent for the small room is $5=
00/month, and the larger one is $750  (less 25% for July, since the rooms a=
ren't available until July 8th).   For a couple however, the rent would be =
$625 each (i.e., a total of  $1250).<br /> <br /> Located in Sunset Park, t=
he apartment is beautiful and very large. I  live on the top two floors of =
a ca. 1900 brownstone. There are 3  bedrooms & a bathroom upstairs and a tr=
uly palatial downstairs with  kitchen, dining room, living room, and office=
 (includes high-speed  internet access). The house is on a residential stre=
et in a safe  neighborhood, 4 blocks from an R subway stop, one stop from t=
he express D  & N trains. During the day and evening, you can get to midtow=
n in  about 35 minutes. I have two cats, so feline-tolerance is a must. <br=
 /> <br /> Sunset Park is located between Red Hook & Bay Ridge along the  h=
arbor, on the D/N Express line, R local. It's adjacent to Park Slope  with =
a bus running between them down 5th Avenue. The neighborhood is  predominan=
tly Mexican, and is next to Brooklyn's Chinatown. Needless to  say there is=
 tremendous food: great tacos, best tamale stand in the  city, an excellent=
 Vietnamese sandwich shop, dim sum, and Sichuan. We're  4 blocks from a big=
 park with an Olympic-size swimming pool, a half  block from a large laundr=
omat, and near the Greenwood Cemetery, among  other nice things.<br /><br /=

28<br /><br /> I'm going away for the last two weeks in August and subletti=
ng my room  in prime Williamsburg on North 7th Street and Kent Ave. 2 block=
s from  the Bedford L, 2 blocks to the waterfront park. Gorgeous, unmissabl=
e  summer space with a rose garden that has a big dining table and  barbecu=
e.<br /> <br /> Laundry, lovely boutiques, and excellent grocery stores and=
 restaurants  are all steps away. 5 minutes into Union Square. Two lovely r=
oommates  who are very quiet and rarely around. The room itself is cozy wit=
h a big  window that looks out onto gorgeous, leafy trees. It has a separat=
e  entrance you're free to use, big closets for storage in the hall, plus a=
  small additional alcove with a dresser and closet. It has both a fan  and=
 an air conditioner.<br /> <br /> This is the perfect place to enjoy a summ=
er stay in NYC. I'm asking $750  for the entire two-week period. While I wo=
ld prefer to rent it for the  entire time I'm gone, I'd also be open to wee=
kly and possibly nightly  rates. All rates are negotiable.<br /><br /> <a s=

012 (dates flexible)<br /><br /> This apt is conveniently located between P=
ark Slope and Carroll Gardens.  <br /> <br /> The apt is a one of a kind 3r=
d floor 3 bedroom/1 bathroom loft space  with a 500sq.ft private rooftop ga=
rden. Renovated kitchen with new  cabinets, stone counters, gas stove, dish=
washer and large cooking island  that opens to a spacious living room with =
a working fire place  (probably won't be using that this summer, but still =
a plus). There's a  washer/dryer located in a separate laundry closet. Spir=
al staircase  leads to the rooftop garden with great views of Manhattan and=
 Brooklyn -  it is amazing in the day and extra special in the evening.  We=
 have our  own entrance on the second floor, which allows room for bikes.  =
Apt has  hardwood floors, exposed brick and built-in shelves throughout.  T=
he  room available has space for a queen bed and a dresser and cost include=
s  all utilities and internet.   <br /> <br /> We just moved in July 1, so =
the furniture seen in the photos is from the  prior tenant, but there is to=
ns of space if you have things you would  like to bring along.  <br /> <br =
/> You'd be sharing the space with two women in their early thirties - one =
 chef who own's her own catering business and one landscape architect.   We=
 are both fun, easy-going, clean and respectful of the space.  We are  look=
ing for the same - someone fun and independent who would love to  have a gl=
ass of wine with us on the roof every now and then, but is also  respectful=
 of a shared home.  It is indeed a beautiful apt and would be  a great summ=
er home.<br /> <br /> Queer friendly home with two cats, but unfortunately =
we can't allow any more pets.<br /><br /> <a style=3D"color: black;" shape=

/> Available: Aug 1, 2012 through Sept 1, 2012<br /><br /> Hi, I am an arti=
st going on a residency for the month of Aug and would  like to sublet my a=
pt in Greenpoint. The apt is pretty big, it is a  traditional railroad with=
 beautiful wood floors and other details. It is  sunny and quiet. I have gr=
eat neighbors, the building is full of older  working prof, so no noise or =
crazy partying! You can bring your dog or  cat if you'd like as it is pet f=
riendly. I have a dog that will be  traveling with me.<br /> <br /> I have =
minimal furniture, a queen bed, a couch, desk and kitchen table  with cooki=
ng stuff. This is my home, it is a quiet get-away from busy  NYC. If you ha=
ven't been to Greenpoint, it is super cool, lots of coffee  shops and eatin=
g, as well as bars but it is super laid back. I am 1  block from the G trai=
n at Greenpoint ave and about a 20 minute walk to  the Bedford L. There is =
also the 62/43 bus at the end of my street and  the lovely water taxi as we=
ll.<br /> <br /> Looking for someone to care for my place as their own and =
enjoy it as  well. 1,150 is REALLY cheap for around here and includes every=
thing as  well as internet.<br /> <br /> Email me with any questions! Thank=

<br /><div>Triangle  Artists Workshop celebrates its thirtieth anniversary =
in  2012, and will  host thirty artists from twenty-two countries in an  in=
tensive two-week  studio program this September in temporary studio  space =
in Dumbo. Among  the many far-flung nations represented, this year  will se=
e first-time  participation by artists from Yemen, Uzbekistan  and Ethiopia=
!</div><br /><div>The  biggest single expense has almost always been provid=
ing  lodgings for  the thirty selected artists for two-weeks. Gone are the =
 days when the  Brooklyn Marriott sponsored us with ten rooms  accommodatin=
g three  artists each for a derisory rate.&nbsp;</div><br /><div>While we  =
don't dare to expect anyone to be able to provide such  accommodation for  =
free these days, we are hoping that someone among  Stephanie Diamond's  enl=
ightened readership might have an affordable  solution, so that more  of th=
e money we have painstakingly fund-raised  can be used to support  the prog=
ram.</div><br /><div>With artists often working  extremely long hours in th=
e Dumbo  studios, the only real criteria for  accommodation is that they wo=
uld  need to be able to get there relatively  easily from Dumbo, including =
at  ungodly hours. Accommodation for all of  the artists should be at a  sm=
all number of locations (up to three  maximum - ideally at one  location).&=

C during the last two weeks of July. &nbsp;I'm looking  for a quiet place i=
n Jersey near the PATH train, with a total price of  $350. &nbsp;Basically,=
 I just want to be able to crash & make sure I get  enough sleep each night=
, maybe do a little stretching. &nbsp;WiFi would be  awesome as well, and b=
eing able to cook a little. &nbsp;I smoke but am used  to going outside. &n=
bsp;If you'll be away, I will gladly feed your cat/water  your plants/colle=
ct your mail and such. &nbsp;Thanks & I look forward to  hearing from you!<=

weather is  perfect: sunny and warm in afternoons, cool in AM and late even=

  Cosmico hosts a big music festival, and Chinati Open House, Marfa's  larg=
est art weekend, is in October.<br /> <br /> My house is in the town proper=
, and it's set up for a writer or artist  -- quiet, calm, wireless, with th=
e 2nd bedroom as an office. There's a  working fireplace, a great porch wit=
h sunset views, and a huge bathroom  with a freestanding sink and an excell=
