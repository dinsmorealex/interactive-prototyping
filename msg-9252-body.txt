$3,000.00 Per Month, Clinton Hill/Navy Yard, Brooklyn, Plenty Of Spaces A=
vailable In Beautiful Newly Renovated Bldg! Huge Range Of Sizes/Prices Av=
ailable!
Available: Feb 01, 2015

To anyone looking for a great new studio space to work in, I have been as=
ked to refer you to a new art studio project. I&#39;ve had my studio in t=
he same building for many years now, and it truly is a wonderful place to=
 work!=20

Because it&#39;s a brand new build out, there are many different spaces a=
vailable. The prices begin at $1025-$1350 for the medium-large ones. All =
have massive windows, and and are perfect size for sharing.

And then there are the truly enormous spaces with FAR more space and even=
 more windows. These range anywhere from $1400 - $4000.=20

Each space will have plenty of light and ventilation, as well as a heat a=
nd AC unit in every space. The building also provides gorgeous rooftop vi=
ews, 24 hour access and security, and an enormous loading dock and freigh=
t elevator.=20

For those not familiar with the area, it&#39;s generally thought of as a =
safe, quiet Brooklyn neighborhood. The building is just a few blocks from=
 the G train, with plenty of food options and easy street parking.

I have had my own art studio in this building for almost 4 years, and the=
 management has asked me to help get interest in the new spaces as they a=
re expanding the number of studios in the building. I will be the one sho=
wing the spaces and there are absolutely NO fees involved.

If you&#39;re interested, please text Jordan. I look forward to hearing f=
rom you. Thanks!

$550.00 Per Month, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, 200 sq. ft., Charming office/stu=
dio available in prime Greenpoint  (includes utilities)
Available: Mar 01, 2015 through Mar 01, 2016

A semi-private space is available Mar. 1st (or sooner, flexible) for subl=
ease in my studio, approximately 200 square feet for $550, utilities incl=
uded (heat &amp; electricity). The ceilings are 11 feet high, so it feels=
 larger. The entire 600 sq foot studio is shared with two other people - =
my space is in the back and completely private with a door, while your sp=
ace is in the middle, divided from the other studio with a partial wall, =
which goes all the way up to the ceiling. There are no windows, but abund=
ant wall space and a small storage loft. Perfect for a painter.

The charming space has one exposed brick wall, and original details of wo=
od ceiling, beams and floor. It feels very comfortable and homey in there=
, great place to work. The photos feature my previous studiomates&#39; st=
uff, but it&#39;s best to take a look at it in person and see how you wou=
ld set it up yourself.

There is a freight elevator, mailbox, slop sink, clean bathrooms, and 24-=
hour access to building. Many artists and creative professionals in the b=
uilding.

Amazing, prime location, just 2 blocks from the G at Greenpoint Ave and w=
alking distance to tons of great bars, shops, and restaurants.

I prefer someone with a quiet practice - no woodworking (occasional is ok=
), loud machines, or toxic materials. I require first month&#39;s rent pl=
us 2 months security deposit. The lease is for one year, but if you need =
to leave before then, you can give me 45 days notice.=20

$289.00 Per Month, Lorimer Stop, Williamsburg, 100 sq. ft., Tiny but Amaz=
ing Studio Share in Real Williamsburg!
Available: Mar 01, 2015

I am looking for someone to share my small, but amazingly located, studio=
 right at the Lorimer L stop--available immediately. I use it mainly for =
storage, so my studio-mate gets 100% access. Perfect for a writer, video/=
photo editor, or just someone who works small, the 10&#39;x10&#39; studio=
 is part of a complex of completely secure--and fully enclosed--studios w=
ith a clean, beautiful, and spacious common area and 24-hour building acc=
ess. Also includes:
- Free wifi
- Free central heat and AC
- Clean bathrooms
- Slop sink
- Freight elevator
- Comfortable, attractive seating in common area
- Vending machines and filtered water cooler in common area=20

Again, I am never there, so you use it around the clock. Caveats are that=
 there is no real natural light (just a little bit from a high window) an=
d there is not a lot of space. My stuff takes up about half of the studio=
, but there is room for a good-size desk (6 ft wide) and some shelving, p=
lus (previous studio-mates have been a painter of small works and a write=
r.)

Weaving Hand is a cultural and modern textiles and healing arts studio th=
at works with individuals with special needs and teaches weaving classes.=
 We also work closely with artists and designers to create commissioned w=
orks.=20

We currently occupy three rooms at 47 hall street and one room was sectio=
ned off for our resident artists. We are taking a break from our resident=
 artist program and would love for someone to make use of this lovely roo=
m!=20

We are in an industrial looking building chuck full of other makers with =
small and large businesses. The building and your studio has 24/7 access =
with a night guard on duty. We have fully stocked vending machines downst=
airs, a super market on Washington avenue and an endless amount of restau=
rants on myrtle avenue. The area is very close to the navy yard and is sa=
fe.

The studio has one partial wall that is 7 1/2 &#39; wall (the wall that c=
onnects with our studio) with two newly installed double paned windows. T=
he studio has a private entrance, shared heater/ ac. And we are very clos=
e to the restrooms (yay!!!)

Heat is included in monthly rate.=20

We are looking for an artist or small business owner that is obviously re=
sponsible, clean and considerate of our business and it&#39;s hours. Sinc=

e kept at a considerable level during open business hours. We prefer some=
one that can rent for the entire 5 months.=20

$1,300.00 Per Month, East Village, New York, One bedroom in three bedroom=
 triplex with private patio
Available: Mar 01, 2015

Hi there!
I&#39;m looking to find someone to take over my portion of the lease in a=
 3 bedroom apartment. The lease expires in August but you would be welcom=
e to renew if you&#39;d like. The apartment is a three bedroom, one bathr=
oom triplex with a large private patio. It&#39;s on the top floor of a wa=
lkup, so be prepared for stairs but it&#39;s worth it for the amazing pat=
io. Laundry in basement of building. Cable/electric is a separate charge =
but averages around 85/month, depending on the season (more expensive in =
the summer due to air conditioning costs). Cost is 1300/month, so it&#39;=
s very affordable, but you will be required to pass a credit check and pa=
y a security deposit and last months rent upon taking over the lease.=20

Ideally I&#39;m looking to find a fun, chill roommate who would get along=
 with two other young professionals who live in the apartment (one man an=
d one woman). They&#39;re very nice and love to work hard and play hard. =
lgbt friendly only.=20

Please reach out if you think you&#39;d be a good fit and I&#39;d love to=
 show you the apartment! March 1st move-in.=20

 the top floor of a 4-story walk-up with lovely views of the surrounding =
area.=20

Our apartment features a private layout with three bedrooms and a kitchen=
 coming off of one hallway. Our large, eat-in kitchen serves as a cozy li=

Share the rest of this 1000 sq ft beautiful, sunny, quiet, top floor brow=

, creative, self-employed. I&#39;ve lived here for 4+ years and made this=
 my hopefully permanent home), 1 other female (20&#39;s, student, friendl=
y, lived here a few months), plus a hip lady cat (11, professional napper=
). We are equally happy hanging out together or keeping to ourselves. No =
smoking, no more pets. Must be employed, clean, and being friendly and fu=
n helps. Additionally, I frequently work from home so I can&#39;t have so=
meone hanging around the house all day, every day. This is a great place =
for someone just moving to nyc, having a changing life situation or just =
looking to live with less stuff!=20

Must be able to pay rent for the upcoming month on the 25th of the curren=
t month and do a weekly rotating chore-No Exceptions. Late rent fee appli=
es.

w/ chair. The room is 9x12, faces the quiet backyards and is steps from a=

Hanging out in the common areas is encouraged. The kitchen is a good size=
 with more than enough room to cook and there is a cozy common space with=
 a projector for movie watching, and a dining table for brunch, game nigh=
t, whatnot. I&#39;m in the process of remodeling the living room a little=
 so it doesn&#39;t look exactly like the pictures, but close.
There are only 2 other units in the building and everyone is super cool a=
nd quiet. There is private roof access and I engage in frequent stoop sit=
ting. The apt is a full top floor of an 1899 brownstone, gets beautiful l=
ight and fresh air all day and is on a charming tree-lined brownstone blo=
ck with amazing neighbors.=20
Everyone who has ever visited my apt comments on how great it is. I&#39;m=
 not trying to brag, just laying out the facts :)

Hart St off Nostrand Ave-a quiet and friendly brownstone block. Few minut=
es walk to G train at Myrtle-Willoughby or Bedford-Nostrand, short bus ri=
des to A/C, J/M, or B/D/N/Q trains. 20 min to Union Square or Lower Manha=
ttan, &lt;10 min to Williamsburg, Downtown Brooklyn. Bars, restaurants, c=
offee shops, laundry, groceries, Pratt, Ymca, parks, Citibike station, al=
l within walking distance. Bed-Stuy has exploded in popularity over the p=
ast few years because of it&#39;s close proximity to Manhattan, many tran=
sit options, authentic neighborhood feel, and it&#39;s Brownstone Brookly=
n charm. I promise you&#39;ll fall in love.

Requirements (I&#39;m not trying to sound like a jerk, I promise! You can=
 thank past shitty roommates for these. I&#39;ve had roommates for most o=
f my adult life and I&#39;ve learned that I just have to have boundaries =
now to keep myself sane)
-You Must Be Clean. I cannot stress this enough.You have to do a chore ev=
ery week and not ignore it or make excuses. I am not a maid.
-Absolutely no smoking of anything anywhere in the building. Landlord rul=
e.
-No drugs of any kind and only social drinking permitted (no alcoholics, =
frequent bing drinkers).
-Must be quiet during normal sleeping hours. No loud music, tv, friends o=
ver. It&#39;s not fair if I and the neighbors have to listen to your life=
 at 3am.
-Drama free. I&#39;m a very laid-back, easy-going person and I don&#39;t =
want to live with people who aren&#39;t.
-You must be able to pay the rent on the 25th of the month, every month, =
without being reminded.
-You can&#39;t have friends/significant other over all of the time. Occas=
ionally is fine but they can&#39;t live here.
-You have experience living with other people. I&#39;ve had enough roomma=
tes in my life to know what makes a good one. If you aren&#39;t familiar =
with a shared living situation, this will not be good for either of us.
-You are responsible for yourself and your actions, and have common sense=
. I hate having to act like a mother.

Please respond with info about yourself and your availability to stop by =
and see the apartment (I&#39;m flexible). Put &quot;sriracha&quot; in you=

$1,150.00 Per Month, Williamsburg (near Greenpoint), Brooklyn, Sunny Room=
 in Floor Through Apartment
Available: Mar 01, 2015

We are looking for someone amiable and decent to set up home in our comfy=
 and spacious apartment. You&#39;d have your own bedroom with two windows=
 and a six foot closet. The bedroom is medium sized with room for a full =
bed and a dresser or desk. You&#39;d also enjoy use of the sizable living=
 room, back porch/patio, and giant kitchen. The bathroom is fairly large =
as well and features a bidet.=20
You&#39;d be living with a mature &amp; friendly couple (former/current m=
usicians) and the occasional appearance by a fine artist who mostly lives=
 with his girlfriend. We like to cook, watch TV, and generally be old &am=
p; boring. But also happy! A scampy &amp; sweet cat resides with us as we=
ll.
I don&#39;t have much in the way of photos as we are in the midst of pain=
ting the living room and the current roommate is still occupying the room=
 we are offering. But you can hopefully see &quot;the bones&quot; of the =
room. A bed (and sheets and towels) can be provided if you&#39;re interes=
ted. We are open to a transient/part time resident or a traditional roomm=
ate. Just mostly concerned with having someone trustworthy and kind.

Available: Mar 01, 2015 through Aug 31, 2016

I am looking for a friendly, responsible, and cleanly flatmate to rent a =
lovely room in my spacious 2-bedroom apartment in Windsor Terrace, Brookl=
yn. The apartment is in a very well maintained pre-war building just a fe=

nt storage space. You are also welcome to keep coats in the front hall cl=
oset and there is room to store a box and/or a suitcase as well.

The remainder of the apartment is fully furnished.=20

I&#39;d like to find a flatmate who is thoughtful, easy-going, and a good=
 communicator. You should also be steadily employed and preferably work a=
way from home by and large. I have lived here for 9.5 years and I am pret=
ty settled in, but I&#39;m happy to share my home. I&#39;d like a roommat=

gether and helping with periodic cleaning of common spaces. I will ask yo=

About Me:

I&#39;m 35 yrs old (female) and I work as Director of community organizin=
g and social justice programs for a non-profit in Manhattan. I am social =
and thoughtful. I am a bit artistic though I tend to lean towards &quot;f=
unctional&quot; art and crafts, carpentry, etc. I like to go hiking and a=
lso enjoy cooking but tend to forage in the fridge when it is just me com=
ing home late from work which happens often. On a typical weeknight, if I=
 am getting home anytime after 8pm, I tend to crash on the couch with a g=
ood book or watch TV, if I haven&#39;t made plans to hang out with friend=
s. On a particularly energetic day, I might wake up and go for a walk/run=
 in the park before work and on others I hit the snooze on my alarm clock=
 several times before I can drag myself to a shower. Aside from an occasi=
onal back log of laundry in my own room, and once in a while a couple of =
rinsed dishes in the sink, I like to keep the apartment very clean and or=
derly for a bit of calm. I expect my flatmate to contribute to maintainin=
g this peaceful and airy vibe.

My Home&#39;s Features:

Well maintained pre-war elevator apartment building with great charm. Red=
 brick building, terrazzo floors in halls and lobby.
Well equipped eat-in-kitchen, with plenty of cabinet space, though best s=
uited for a tall person, which I am not...
Large living room with ample seating and space to relax after a long day.=
=20
Original hardwood floors throughout and many windows.
Clean space and clutter free.
Pay per load washers/dryers available in basement.
Sorry, NO pets allowed.
No cigarette smokers.
Please do not email me if you are a couple seeking housing together... I =
am looking for one roommate only.

If you are interested please send me a note with information about yourse=
lf like I have included here. Please allow me a day or so to respond.=20

y to take care of her will fall on you, unless you love little dogs and w=
ant to play ball with her. I am hoping to find someone who is mature and =
cheerful and takes pride in their space and who they are. I love art, run=
ning, design and the occasional dinner party.

of sunlight, very spacious and clean kitchen/living area, nice wood floor=

letely furnished so there is not a lot room for much added furniture.

The Room: The room available is 12&#39;x12&#39; (w/ fabulous 16&#39; ceil=
ings). It is not furnished except for a very elegantly constructed white =
wooden loft bed frame, which maximizes use of the floor space beneath it.=

n-sized elevators, bike storage, door buzzer/intercom, w/ trash shoot and=
 recycling in hallway and roof access that gives a great view of Manhatta=

$1,050.00 Per Month, Park Slope, Brooklyn, Bedroom in 3BR Park Slope Apar=
tment
Available: Jan 15, 2015 through Sept 15, 2015

Hi there! I&#39;m heading abroad and am looking for someone to take over =
the lease (Feb-September) for my room in a fantastic Park Slope apartment=
! Time is of the essence and I am looking for serious candidates who are =
able to move in immediately (like, any day, really).

About the place:
The apartment is a 3 bedroom, 1 bath set up with a lovely kitchen and coz=
y living room (with a super sweet brick wall!). The room for rent is on t=
he small side (8.5 ft x 8.75 ft) but has a nice closet and one window. It=
 currently has a bed/mattress, as well as a bookcase and full length mirr=
or -- these are free of charge!=20
Rent is $1,050 per month, plus utilities, which tend to add up to about $=
50-$70, depending on the time of year. The building is a brownstone that =
is both steps from the R train and 5th Avenue.=20

And the neighborhood? Awesome. Tons of restaurants, shops, and just a 15 =
min walk from Prospect Park (runs, picnics, farmers markets, concerts, pe=
ople watching, frisbee - you name it, we got it). Full of nice people, to=
o.

About the roommates:
One roommate is an amazing gal in her late 20&#39;s. She works for a non-=
profit in manhattan and tends to have a busy schedule. That being said, s=
he is always down to hang out for a few drinks. She&#39;s also a great co=
ok and loves to show off her midwestern roots in the kitchen. The other r=
oommate is leaving shortly for a new job in a new place, so more info on =
that to come.

About you:
You should be: awesome! ..aaaaand...reliable, able to pay bills on time*,=
 employed, tidy, ok with cooking in the apt, down for a good time but not=
 always bringing the party home, just an overall enjoyable person (good e=
nergy!) :)=20

*The landlord is a bit strict about who can sign on, so I would need to k=
now for sure that you could pass a credit check (or have a guarantor sign=
).

ack. The loft has a big open kitchen with skylight and a large common are=
a with wall to wall windows and plenty of room for our bikes.  It&#39;s l=
ocated in the thick of Williamsburg only 4 blocks away from the L train (=
10 minutes to Union Square) and easy walking/biking distance to all the g=
reat restaurants, bars, and shops the neighborhood has to offer. Having l=
ived here for the past 9 years, I can attest to the amazing location and =
convenience of living in the neighborhood at this specific apartment.

We are hardworking, clean, friendly and motivated in our early 20s and 30=
s: a male cinematographer and camera assistant and for tv, films, and com=
mercials (http://kylerepka.com/), a female working as a Copy Writer and Y=
oga instructor, and a male working as a Digital Product Designer for a fi=
rm in Dumbo. We keep a quiet, tidy, and respectful atmosphere about the a=
partment, so if you&#39;re loud, unkempt, and a jerk, please don&#39;t re=
spond to this post! Being very busy with our work responsibilities and va=
rious activities (traveling, going to concerts, cooking, exercising, week=
end trips, etc...), it&#39;s a rarity to all be at the apartment at the s=
ame time, but if so we&#39;re happy to see each other and catch up or coo=
k dinner. We&#39;re definitely not crazy party people, but we do occasion=
ally enjoy crazy parties, just not at our place.

If you think this seems like a good fit please respond to the post as soo=
n as possible.  Ideally, you&#39;re a considerate and interesting charact=
er with full-time job/class/internship responsibilities at relatively nor=
mal hours (no stay up all night vampires please) who does not use drugs o=
r smoke inside the apartment. We discourage work-from-home hermit types, =
wayward tourists/travelers, and bar/club/late-night employees as those ro=
ommates predominantly have completely erratic lifestyles compared to our =
own.  If you&#39;ve lived in a loft before that would be a plus but not t=
otally necessary, so long as you&#39;re aware and respectful of others. I=
&#39;m allergic to cats, so no-go for felines. We love dogs, but we&#39;r=
e very hesitant to invite along a full-time 5th roommate, especially if h=
e/she drools, smells, and barks (this goes for pets and significant other=
s - sorry, no couples).  The room is for one human.=20

All utilities are included in the $1,300 per month rent (heat, water, gas=
, electric, cable, internet, everything). One month security deposit ($13=
00) is required upon move-in that could ultimately be used for your last =
month&#39;s stay.

$1,400.00 Per Month, Central Williamsburg/ Southside, Brooklyn, 1,400 sq.=
 ft., Large, sunny bedroom (furnished) in 2 bedroom loft - Prime Williams=
burg
Available: Apr 06, 2015 through Aug 31, 2015

Available: as of April 6 until through August or September (with possibil=
ity to extend)
L-train Bedford Avenue=20

I am looking for a quiet, courteous, responsible roommate for a 4-6+ mont=
h term to share my duplex loft apartment with.

The Room For Rent: 350 sq ft (33 sq meters) room in a large duplex loft; =
lots of light; laminate hardwood floors; exposed brick walls; 2 large win=
dows facing east with Brooklyn skyline views and morning sun; simply furn=
ished with full sized bed, desk, chairs, couch, shelves, wardrobe, chest =
of drawers, TV/DVD/ cable channels with HBO and IFC.
The room is divided into 3 areas: sleeping/office/ lounge area. It is sep=
arated from the rest of the apartment by a regular door and has the size =
of a New York studio apartment.
All shelves and closets are empty - ample of room to store your belonging=
s. The room has bedding, linen and towels - if you don&#39;t have your ow=
n.

L-train: Bedford Avenue. One stop to Manhattan.=20
J-train: Marcy Avenue. One stop to Manhattan.
Location: central Williamsburg - Southside. Near East River and Bridge.

The Loft: two bedroom Duplex (1,400 sq ft / 130 sq m) with lots of sun; t=
he bathroom, living area and open kitchen (with dishwasher) are downstair=
s and the 2 bedrooms upstairs; the loft is on the upper floors or a conve=
rted industrial warehouse with nice river- and Brooklyn views; washer/dry=
er available in building two floors up or drop-off laundry one block away=
; wireless internet (not super fast but functional); Direct TV; ceiling f=
ans in all rooms; no pets in apartment. This is NOT one of the newly buil=
t luxury buildings in the neighborhood but rather an original warehouse s=
pace with a great community of long-term Williamsburg residents, artists =
and people from all corners of the world.
=20
Located in the southside of Williamsburg near the East River with the clo=
sest train station at Bedford Ave (L-train) ; there are lots of restauran=
ts, movie theaters, bars, clubs and coffee shops in walking distance. Sev=
eral supermarkets and health food stores are within a 5 block radius. Ver=
y safe, fun neighborhood.
=20
I am looking for ONE person who wants to move in temporarily without thei=
r entire household. There is plenty of room to store your belongings but =
since the room is fully furnished you would need to put your own furnitur=
e into storage.

It is very important to me to share the loft with only one person. It is =
a big space but there is only 1 bathroom. Please - no couples, no out-of-=
town guests, no live-in boy/girlfriends, no pets.=20

I am looking for someone who is easy-going, respectful, free of drama and=
 parties outside the house. I think it is best for both of us if you are =
also fully employed outside the house or a serious graduate student.=20

Rent: $1,400/ month plus 1/2 electric bill=20
All other utilities are included (gas/internet/ Direct TV).

The loft is heated by forced air from a geothermal heat exchange. These m=
achines run on electricity. In the winter months your share might run fro=
m $80-$125/month. The rest of the year it runs $40-$60/month per person.=20=

Air-conditioning: there is air-conditioning in the apartment but i almost=
 never use it. The wind from the East River as well as the ceiling fans h=
ave provided ample relief from the heat in the pas. If you feel hot easil=
y, there is the possibility to run the A/C just in your room. Use of the =
A/C unit would increase the monthly electricity bill for the summer.=20

About myself: I am originally from Germany, female, 52 years/ old; non-sm=
oker; interested in the outdoors, arts, music, traveling, bicycling. I ha=
ve lived for a really long time here in Williamsburg and I work in TV new=
s production.=20
Since I really enjoy coming home to a quiet apartment where i can just ch=
ill out after work, I am looking for someone who is equally inclined and =
appreciates a comfortable, calm space.
I am not home that much as I work most weekdays in Manhattan. In the summ=
er I like to go out to the beaches on Long Island. I also spend a fair am=
ount of time with friends outside the house. The apartment has a well-siz=
ed kitchen and you&#39;ll have your own counter-sized refrigerator. I ten=
d to prepare my meals at home but I&#39;m not much of a cook.

Please let me know how long you are planning to stay and some information=
 about yourself.
Thanks for your interest.

There is a $700 deposit to secure the space which I will happily return w=
hen you move out.

$1,475.00 Per Month, Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, 240 sq. ft., Gorgeous, B=
right, Spacious Bedroom/Work Space Available April 1 - with Laundry, Dish=
washer, Private Backyard!
Available: Apr 01, 2015

Gorgeous, massive space in a wonderful 2BR apartment in prime Prospect He=
ights opening up April 1.

I&#39;m sad to have to vacate it and here are some of the reasons for thi=
s sadness:

The room is about 24x12ft with hard-wood floors and a large closet. Plent=
y of room to convert to an office/bedroom or really whatever your heart d=
esires. Ballet studio, anyone? Let&#39;s get creative.

The apartment is quite large itself and has a 20x10ft private, secluded, =
fenced-in backyard. With a grill. So wonderful. Imagining sitting out the=
re in the summer sun is just making me colder and sadder by contrast righ=
t now

This apartment is one floor of a charming three-story brownstone, and off=
ers storage space in the basement, a washer/dryer, a dishwasher, all the =
works.

The location is so fantastic, it&#39;s hard to put into words. This place=
 is so close to every train (C/G at Clinton/Washington, B/Q at 7th Ave, 2=
/3 at Bergen and a short bus or walk to Atlantic Avenue), B65 bus, B45 an=
d B69.

Apartment is right off Vanderbilt Ave (amazing restaurants, shops, grocer=
y stores) and a stone&#39;s throw from Prospect Park, the library and Bro=
oklyn Museum.

You&#39;ll be sharing the apartment with a very kind, funny, down-to-eart=
h and responsible lady with a full-time job. The lease is up Sept 1 and t=
his responsible lady will be moving to LA for grad school, so you can dec=
ide if you want to leave then or stay on and bring in a friend to fill he=
r spot.

Working from home is totally welcome.

Common spaces are furnished, but bedroom is not. (But if you are looking =
for furniture, we can discuss.)

Tenant must be kind, reliable, easy-going, respectful, and tidy.

The landlord asks that we lock this in before March. Happy to answer any =
questions and show the place. This place truly is a gem. Hope it&#39;s a =
match!

$500.00 Per Month, Ridgewood, Queens, 75 sq. ft., Spacious apartment with=
 shared workspace for artists
Available: Mar 01, 2015

Sunny, cozy (translation, not huge) room with tons of shelves already ins=
talled, a loft for sale and two decent sized closets (one in the room and=
 one in the apartment&#39;s hallway.  It is currently painted pale pink b=
ut I can talk to the landlord about getting more paint to change the colo=
r and to the outgoing roommate about changing it as well.=20

You have the option of using the living room as a shared workshop. If you=
 are a musician there needs to be communication about when you are practi=
cing but I&#39;m pretty open to supporting your creative practice.  My ol=
d roommate Kevin had the smaller room before and basically set up his off=
ice/bedroom extension in the shared common space and it was totally fine =
and nice to have him around. =20

Anna, the second roommate, is a social worker who recently graduated from=
 NYU.  I&#39;m an arts educator/visual artist who is also an amateur musi=
cian (vocals and baritone uke). We like to have our home relatively clean=
 but am not OCD in the least.  Dishes need to be managed but we understan=
d if you are running late and need to wash something later.  We all pitch=
 in with chores and we also communicate if there is something happening i=
n the space that we&#39;d like to change (cleaning schedule etc).  I also=
 have an adorable and playful cat named Lemmy who will totally stay out o=
f your room if you want but is very sweet and friendly.  But yes, dander =
happens if you are allergic.  =20

I love plants, going to shows (music and art), science geekery (big Radio=
lab fan) and am currently making work in a variety of media, including pa=
inting, drawing and collage.  I am totally down for cooking together and =
like having a convivial home.  More than happy to share my yoga mat or so=
me food, tea or a little wine unwinding with roommates after a day&#39;s =
work. =20

The apartment is on a dead-end tree-lined street (yes these exist in NYC!=
) very close to all amenities. Fresh Pond Road has everything you need.  =
The neighborhood is extremely safe with lots of families and folks who ca=
re about their neighborhood.  I love how calm and quiet it is out here an=
d hopefully you will too.=20

Loud parties are discouraged.  Occasionally I will have one or two people=

Hi!

I&#39;m looking for a roommate in my apartment. It&#39;s a super convenie=
nt location in South Williamsburg- 5 minute walk to the JMZ and a little =
under 10 to the L train.=20
It&#39;s a cozy, beautifully lit spot.=20

I&#39;m open to a bunch of options! A month stay, an open-ended thing, et=
c. The room (that&#39;s pictured empty) is furnished with a bed, lamp, dr=
esser and rug but I don&#39;t have a picture because my current roommate =
(and her things) are in there...To be  honest, it&#39;d be ideal if you w=
ere not planning on bringing too much furniture.=20

Couple things about the place (and me):=20

I work a bunch and probably want to live with someone who keeps the same =
amount of busy as I do.=20

On the scale of 1 to annoyingly-clean-and-organized-and-sparse- I lean to=
wards the annoyingly clean and organized and sparse.=20
=20
So. That&#39;s it. Let&#39;s chat. My pics don&#39;t really do the place =
justice- it&#39;s a great spot. I&#39;m just looking for a competent, rea=
lly kind, independent, fun, clean person that I don&#39;t find depressing=
!=20

I know searching for housing is tough- I&#39;ll do my best to be really p=
rompt and clear on my end.=20

Thanks!

m the rest of the apartment, toward the front and up one step. It is larg=

 studio-style. There&#39;s a breakfast bar area with seating, coffee pres=

$1,150.00 Per Month, West Harlem/Morningside Heights, New York, Large Roo=
m w/ French Doors Available for 6 Months
Available: Apr 01, 2015 through Sept 30, 2015

My room is available for sublet April 1st for six months, at which time y=
ou could consider renewing the lease with my roommates. We are looking fo=
r a professional women in her mid-twenties-early thirties, as you would b=
e joining two other mid-twenties professional well educated women. You mu=
st be someone committed to keep common areas clean (bathroom, living room=
, kitchen), while your room is of course your business. We don&#39;t mind=
 if you have guests over, as long as it&#39;s not a party every night typ=
e of situation. For the most part everyone is active, social and really b=
usy, so even though you would be living with two women, the apartment is =
so big and everyone is so busy, that you will never feel crowded.

I left only because I am saving up for business school, which I am attend=
ing in the fall. The room is the biggest in the unit, with french doors, =
big windows, ton of sunlight. I don&#39;t have any pictures right now bec=
ause I have already left (the room is currently being subleased to someon=
e else), but if this sounds like something you would be interested in I c=
an put you in touch with my roommate who can schedule time for you to sto=
p by/send pictures.=20

The apartment itself is a massive 3.5 bedroom/1 bathroom unit with brand =
new everything in terms of appliances and finishes. Sharing the bathroom =
won&#39;t be an issue, I promise! The elevator building is in a great are=
a, near tons of shops and restaurants (our building is diagonal from Cedr=
ic&#39;s Restaurant). No laundry in the building, but we all use a laundr=
y delivery service which is very reliable and cheap (and so much better t=
han doing it yourself!)

Rent is $1150 total (including all utilities, which are electric, gas, in=
ternet). At this time we do not have cable (or a tv) but if you have one =
you would like to bring, thats fine with us and we can look into basic ca=
ble offerings if that&#39;s really important to you. The bedroom is fully=
 furnished (queen bed, dresser, storage bench, nightstand, lamp, chair, e=
tc) but if you would prefer to bring your own furniture, that should be f=
ine too.

We prefer no pets, but this might, emphasis on might, be negotiable.

$60.00 Per Day, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, Cozy private room sublet in beauti=
ful Fort Green brownstone
Available: Feb 18, 2015 through Feb 18, 2016

Hi there,

We are a relaxed group of creative folk looking to sublet out a cosy doub=
le room in our beautiful Fort Green brownstone.

Our home is on a lovely tree lined street half a block from restaurants, =
bars and the Brooklyn Flea. There is easy access via a variety of subways=
 to Manhattan. We are also just a few blocks from Fort Greene Park and th=
e weekly farmers market. The neighborhood also has a great variety of res=
taurants and bars, as well as local gyms and yoga studios.

The house itself is 3 floors. The house is an historic Brooklyn turn of t=
he century brownstone. The first floor is the kitchen and living space wi=
th access to our back deck and yard. The great advantage to this floor is=
 that it has no bedrooms, so you can come and go with whatever schedule y=
ou need and not bother anyone sleeping.=20
We have a large living room with couches and tv. The kitchen has an 8 sea=
ter table to entertain at and a fully stocked kitchen for the avid cook! =
This floor also has a washer and dryer.

Upstairs 1 floor is the bathroom and 2 bedrooms. The top floor has 2 bedr=
ooms. The bedroom is compact and cozy with a full size bed and a great vi=
ew of the leafy green yard. The room itself is quite small but perfect fo=
r a short term visit. This is a wonderful place to say but not suited to =
someone with a lot of luggage, since the floor space in the room is limit=
ed and no closets are available.

Living in the house are 3 guys, 1 girl and 2 kitties. This is a peaceful =
and relaxed house that can be a great base for a fun trip to NYC, whateve=
r your reasons.

We are not looking for a long term sublet: we are instead hoping to provi=
de a short term option for creative people in need who are passing throug=
h NYC, or in between homes. Please get in touch for information.

Thanks!

Hywel, Alex, Lisa and Tlaloc.

$275.00 Per Week, Crown Heights, Brooklyn, Large Sunny Room for Sublet in=
 Historic Crown Heights
Available: Mar 15, 2015 through Mar 30, 2015

I&#39;m subletting my large sunny bedroom in a pleasant Crown Heights 3 b=
edroom garden apartment from March 15 - 30. Apartment is located on a qui=
et, tree lined residential street a few minutes walk from the 4/3 train (=
Utica station).

Sublet room is the largest of the bedrooms with windows facing the street=

ookcase - together with the closet there is plenty of space for your clot=
hes. You have free use of the rest of the apartment, which includes the l=
iving room, a good sized kitchen (vegetarian cooking, please), mini back =
porch and backyard garden (see pictures). It&#39;s winter so the garden i=

ght, and it is really beautiful when it snows. Wild urban birds hang out =
back there all winter, some with spectacular blue and red coloring.

You will be sharing the space with a professional male in his 40s who obs=
erves the Jewish day of rest (ie, the Sabbath). Lots of working, praying =
and simple socializing; no big parties. Also, my adorable, friendly and e=
ntertaining tabby cat, Sidd, loves to snuggle and will keep you cozy if y=
ou like.=20

--$275/week; OR

$750.00 Per Month, Carroll Gardens / Red Hook, Brooklyn, 116 sq. ft., Red=
 Hook / Carroll Gardens - room available in beautiful 3 bedroom home
Available: Mar 01, 2015

Hi Everyone, our apartment is a neighborhood which is considered the Colu=
mbia Waterfront District- right between where Carroll Gardens ends and Re=
d Hook begins, and I&#39;m looking for a new roommate. The apartment is o=
n Columbia Street, right next to the Jalopy Theater/Tavern, a 10/15 minut=
e walk to the F/G at Carroll and a block or two to the B61 bus which goes=
 through downtown Brooklyn and into Park Slope. There is decent street pa=
rking if you have a car, and it is a quick bike ride into the city as we =
are close to the Brooklyn Bridge. There are parks and gardens galore, fir=
eflies in the summer, the scent of the sea year round, great coffee, food=
, and live music, and a lovely all easily within reach. Easy access to al=
l the joys and escapes of Red Hook, and yet, convenient access to trains/=
buses. We really love our location!=20

The apartment itself is a three bedroom, one bathroom railroad - meaning =
the bedrooms are all connected to one another. It has worked really well =
for three considerate and communicative female roommates, who enjoy doing=
 life together. The room available is the first room - which is a good si=
ze, 12.8 by 9 feet or 116 square feet, has its own closet, and dark hardw=
ood floors. There are no windows in the bedroom, however light comes in f=
rom both rooms on either side, and the apartment has a ton of well lit co=
mmon space, a living and dining area, bathroom, kitchen, as well as an ex=
terior roof top space that we often use as a hangout space, a place to ga=
rden and BBQ. We keep a pretty quiet home, and have developed a weekly cl=
eaning schedule - (though we are sometimes lax about this). 154 by 109

Rent is $750 not including utilities- those usually run about 30-50 dolla=
rs depending on the season. Only first month to move in - no security dep=
osit necessary. The room will be available March 1st, although there is a=
lso a possibility for a sooner move in date. We would consider someone lo=
oking to stay longer, or just a sublet, we&#39;re flexible.=20

We will be showing the space for the next week. We are two women, both in=
 our late 20&#39;s, one works in independent publishing and the other is =
an art teacher/nanny. We are looking for a female roommate, mid to late 2=
0&#39;s or 30&#39;s preferably someone mindful, tidy, and committed to ha=
ving a peaceful and fun home. Please respond by letting us know what you&=
#39;re up to in NY, how you spend your free time, what you&#39;re excited=
 about, etc!

$300.00 Per Week, East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Room for sublet in nice Lo=
ft with Private deck!
Available: Mar 14, 2015 through Mar 28, 2015

Hi Guys,=20

I am subletting my room in a very nice loft in East Williamsburg from Mar=
ch 14th to March 28th. The loft is big, with a nice living room area and =
a huge private deck. My roommates are very nice (1 girl and 2 boys), two =
of them are journalists and work from home and the 3rd one is a graphic d=
esigner and works in Dumbo. We are very laid-back, respectful of each oth=
er and like to have dinner together from time to time (and my roommates a=
re very good cooks!). The room isn&#39;t very big but it is nice and comf=
y. It has a loft bed and a desk underneath it. Also, it doesn&#39;t have =
an outside window, it has a high window that brings light from the (very)=
 bright living room. The high window has curtains if you don&#39;t want a=
ny light at all and is very high and therefore doesn&#39;t look into the =
whole bedroom but only the ceiling area (am I making sense?), so don&#39;=
t worry about privacy!
What else? Super well located, 3 blocks from the Graham stop on the L, ea=
sy ride to Manhattan and the heart of Williamsburg. Nice area with great =
coffee shops, bars and restaurants. Don&#39;t hesitate to email me for mo=
re info! Price is 300 per week but if you stay both weeks I can give you =
a discount.

$1,100.00 Per Month, Bushwick, Brooklyn, Three-room space in an artist li=
ve/work building
Available: Mar 01, 2015

Three rooms in a spacious live/work building shared with other artists.
Available for six months beginning March 1st.

We are renting a space in our building on the Bushwick/East Williamsburg =
border on Broadway right next to the JMZ line. The building is pre-war wi=
th tall ceilings, old mouldings, and plaster lathe walls. We have the 2nd=
 and 3rd floor of the three story building. We are two blocks from the en=
trance to the Flushing Ave J/M stop in Bushwick, and a 10 minute walk to =
the Morgan L, Flushing G, or Broadway G.

Our building houses eight live/work spaces with a range of artists (paint=
ing, photography, sculpture, performance, etc.) performance artists. We a=
re not a collective but are looking for an environment where dedicated ar=
tists can have space and comfort to create. Everyone works different sche=
dules, and each have similar large, private spaces. This is a quiet place=
 shared by working artists in their 30&#39;s and 40&#39;s. I live in the =
building too and co-manage the space with another artist. Both of us will=
 be showing the available space on Saturday.

We are looking for One conscientious and respectful Visual Artist who nee=
ds space to work to move in to our building for six months, potentially f=
or longer.

The available space for rent is comprised of three connected rooms: 12ft =
x 15ft, 8ft x 10ft, and 8ft x 10ft. This is a private space on the second=
 floor of the building, with two windows facing Broadway (and the elevate=
d train) and a door leading into the shared space on the second floor of =
the building. The rooms are unfurnished. There is a large shared kitchen =
and shared bathroom on the floor, plus free washer and dryer. All utiliti=
es are included. There are no fees beyond usual first months rent plus la=
st as a deposit which would be due at move-in.

$1,150.00 Per Month, Bushwick/Ridgewood, Brooklyn, Sunny room plus studio=
/workspace plus private garden!
Available: Feb 17, 2015


Sunny room and studio/workspace in Bushwick/Ridgewood, $1150, heat includ=
ed.

Two private adjoining sunny rooms that open onto a private garden availab=
le. One room is a bedroom and the other a studio/workspace. The bedroom i=
s furnished with a wardrobe and clothes rack. The rooms are both quiet an=
d private, and have exclusive access to the private yard. The yard is so =
great and relaxing, there is a grapevine trellis that provides natural sh=
ade all summer, an herb garden that is bursting with mint, rosemary and b=
asil, and a yard of violets with a lilac tree in the middle. It&#39;s lik=
e a second living room in summer, whether it&#39;s for coffee on a sunday=
 morning, a glass of wine in the evening with a friend, or a think-break =
while you work.

The apartment is a classic large pre-war boxed garden apt with living spa=
ces on opposite ends, with original detailing, high ceilings and hardwood=
 floors. It&#39;s been renovated with refinished floors and new tile, but=
 the landlord kept the original character of the building. It&#39;s rathe=
r large and the layout is such that you can rarely see your one roommate =
(me).  This is also a great situation if you need studio space, the secon=
d room has wall space, natural light, ventilation in summer, and is separ=
ated from the living space by a door and so could be used by a painter.
I have the opposite end of the apt and use it as a live/work studio, alth=
ough I am often not there and don&#39;t use the kitchen much, so you woul=
d frequently have the place to yourself. I work in drawing, collage and p=
hotography.

The apt is located in an ideal area on the Bushwick/Ridgewood border, on =
a tree lined street off pretty St. Nicholas Ave. It&#39;s a short 3 block=
 walk to the L at DeKalb, as there is an L entrance and platform at Stanh=
ope and so you don&#39;t have to walk to DeKalb. It&#39;s a safe walk day=
 or night. An added bonus is that it&#39;s also 3 blocks to the M train, =
for those all too frequent L train closures.
It&#39;s close to galleries, restaurants, cafes and local bars, with laun=
dry across the street and a great local bakery.  One person please, no co=
uples, and sorry no dogs.

Beautiful and spacious one bedroom apartment in a quiet owner-occupied 3-=

vate top floor =3D third floor =3D walk up two flights.
=20
Big living room (15x15) in the center of the apartment with two side wind=

One incredibly large bedroom with four windows
Details include picture-frame molding
New sunny kitchen includes a dishwasher and dining area=20
which is overlooking owners Tuscan garden (no garden access with this apa=
rtment)
Gorgeous hardwood floors throughout (kitchen has Italian tile floor)
Fully-tiled, 1970&#39;s-style bathroom, charming in its own way and has t=
he uncommon feature of a small window.  The tiles are reminiscent of Phil=
ip Johnson&#39;s Glass House bathroom.
=20
10-minute drive to Manhattan, or 22 minute ride on N-Express (3 stops to =
Canal Street, 4 stops to Union Square)
Several laundromats in the area (no washer/dryer in building)
Hundreds of restaurants, plus food markets etc. on the commercial avenues=
 of 8th Ave and 5th Ave
=20
We are in the Chinatown end of the neighborhood known as Sunset Park.  (S=
unset Park is the predominantly-rowhouse neighborhood between Park Slope =
and Bay Ridge.)  Our very clean, pet-free and smoke-free brick rowhouse i=
s on residential 60th Street off 6th Avenue. N-Express or R-Local trains =
at the popular 59th Street station (59th St/4th Ave).  22 mins subway rid=
e to lower Manhattan, 27 minutes to Union Square/14th Street.  Within Bro=
oklyn, the R-Local is particularly convenient to Gowanus and Park Slope, =
as well as to Bay Ridge.
=20
Traditionally an immigrant neighborhood, high prices elsewhere have broug=
ht many renters priced out of Park Slope, Carroll Gardens and the other m=
ore expensive brownstone neighborhoods, Williamsburg, etc.  There are so =
many artist studios in Sunset Park, including at the incredible Brooklyn =
Army Terminal on the waterfront (58th-63rd Streets), Industry City, and a=
t other converted waterfront warehouses.  We are firmly in the residentia=
l area, between 6th and 7th Avenues. This is an untrendy, safe, convenien=
t neighborhood with exceptional transportation options.  Sunset Park is l=
ow-rise, low-key, yet has nearly every amenity, is convenient to Manhatta=
n, and is a good value.  The &quot;Sunset Park&quot; NYC park itself is a=
bout a mile away, a very pleasant walk along 6th Ave from the house.  Bay=
 Ridge&#39;s Owl&#39;s Head Park, along with the restaurants, movie theat=
er, shopping and spectacular waterfront jogging path of Bay Ridge are the=
 next neighborhood down.=20
=20
My mother-in-law on the first floor, who has owned the building for 40+ y=
ears, gardens with a passion (in addition to the view of the distant Verr=
azano Bridge, the view from the apartment includes her private, spectacul=
ar Tuscan garden) (no garden access with rental apartments).  The current=
 resident of this top-floor apartment is a graphic designer from Carroll =
Gardens who has loved living here for the past six years.  The other resi=
dent of the building is a professional woman on the 2nd floor, a native o=
f South Africa, who relocated from Prospect Heights a couple of years ago=
.  My mother-in-law&#39;s former tenants include some internationally-rec=
ognized artists including a painter, a Village Voice cartoonist/published=
 author/artisinal pencil sharpener, and a fashion designer, as well as pe=
ople in other professions over the years.
=20
We are seeking someone who is friendly and cooperative (it will be like y=
our own grandma is living two floors below you!) and who lives a quiet li=
festyle.  Good landlord references desired; minimum income $60K.  Please =
write to tell a little about yourself and please indicate your preferred =
date and time to visit.  Available for May 1 occupancy, ideally with a tw=
o-year lease but we will consider one-year lease.  No brokers, agents, sh=
ares, pets or animals of any kind, please, and no smokers.  $1650 rent in=
cludes heat and hot water.  Thanks for your interest in space and light, =
and for expanding your horizons to Sunset Park!

$1,900.00 Per Month, South Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 450 sq. ft., Cozy Will=
iamsburg Sublet Available for April!
Available: Apr 01, 2015 through Apr 30, 2015

Hello!
My boyfriend and I are subletting our cute Williamsburg apartment for the=
 month of April while we go tour around Morocco! We&#39;re both photograp=
hers and have filled our space with photos, books and lots of little weir=
d things from our travels. Our hope is that we will find a couple or one =
person to take care of our little oasis for the month we are away, and en=
joy it as much as we do.

The apartment is located on the southside of Williamsburg - very close to=
 the JMZ train line at the Marcy Ave stop (the first one in Brooklyn). I =
commute to work in TriBeCa daily and it takes on average 11 minutes to ge=
t there. We are also located right above two bus stops - one that takes y=
ou directly into Greenpoint, and one that goes directly into Bushwick. Al=
l you need, right?

There is a wonderful restaurant in the bottom floor of our building and m=
arkets close by for grocery shopping. We&#39;re about a 10 minute walk fr=
om the circus that is Bedford Ave. and about 5 minutes from Havemeyer/Gra=
nd St. area. There are tons of great bars and restaurants, yoga studios a=
nd other activities around the neighborhood as well as conveniently locat=
ed laundromats and groceries.

The building is incredibly quiet with only 5 units and very respectful ne=
ighbors. Everyone here is a young professional and we try to keep noise t=
o a minimum to keep everyone happy. There are no weird quirks to our plac=
e - but in the event there is a problem our superintendent is wonderful a=

$2,500.00 Per Month, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 600 sq. ft., Affordable 2bed=
 or 1bed +studio/office in amazing location!
Available: Mar 01, 2015 through Sept 30, 2015

I am moving and need to sublet my 2bed apartment through the end of the l=
ease, September 30, 2015. There would be an opportunity to apply with the=
 building management if you are interested in leasing after September. Th=
e apartment is on the 5th/top floor of a pre-war walkup with a modernized=
 entrance and large, original marble stairway (no elevator, but great exe=
rcise!). Being on the top floor, the apartment is very quiet, with no one=
 living above. I have lived here for over 4 years and have never had trou=
ble with the neighbors or any major problems with the building. The super=
 is also really responsive and lives only a few blocks away. The apartmen=
t itself would be perfect for a single person looking for a nice-sized be=
droom and a studio space/office/guest room/den or it could also be perfec=
t for a couple. The best feature by far, however, is the location. It is =
incredibly safe. There is an amazing restaurant on the ground floor of th=
e building that is open late and ads charm and a great vibe to the corner=
--it will become your go-to spot! You are steps away from all the shops, =
restaurants, and amenities on Grand St., not even 10min away from all tha=
t Bedford has to offer, and 5min walk to either the L/Lorimer stop or the=
 J,M/Marcy Ave. stop, each only 1/2 stops from Manhattan. I am moving out=
 completely before March 1, and the apartment would come unfurnished.=20
