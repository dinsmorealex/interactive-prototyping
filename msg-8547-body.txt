$850.00 Per Month, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 900 sq. ft., Ground Floor Gall=
ery/Studio share available in Prime Williamsburg
Available: Dec 08, 2014

I just took over a gallery space that just moved out. Im turing it into a=
 studio to share with 1 or 2 other artists. I will be splitting the space=
 into 3 separate work areas. The space has a huge storefront window and i=
s on the ground floor on Montrose avenue and Lorimer, right off the J/M/L=
 train in Williamsburg. Its a great sized studio that I want to double as=
 a pop up gallery for the tenants and other guest artists. There is also =
a backyard that can be utilized (you just can&#39;t build anything crazy =
like a trojan horse back there).

All Utilities Included with Rent:=20
Heat / Air Conditioning / Ventilation,=20
Electricity,=20
Water,=20
Wi-Fi

I am looking for 3 month long commitments or longer. Flexible on arrangem=
ents

This location is in a prime spot just 10 minutes from getting into the ci=
ty. Great for studio visits that don&#39;t require your collectors travel=
ing hours to your place in Long Island

I have attached a few pictures. The gallery literally just moved out, so =
the place has not been cleaned yet. I also can send you a video of the sp=
ace to give you a better idea as to what it looks like. Visits are welcom=
e.

There are two opposing 17&#39; walls and a 12&#39; wall in the front sect=
ion.

$850 for 1 artist (2 spaces available)=20
or
$1500.00 if you want to just share the space with me and take the entire =
second 1/2

Please don&#39;t hesitate to ask any questions.

Thank you!

$600.00 Per Month, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, 200 sq. ft., Charming office/stu=
dio available in prime Greenpoint  (includes utilities)
Available: Jan 01, 2015

A semi-private space is available for sublease in my studio beginning Jan=
uary 1st, approximately 200 square feet for $600, utilities included (hea=
t &amp; electricity). The ceilings are 11 feet high, so it feels larger. =
The entire 600 sq foot studio is shared with two other people - my space =
is in the back and completely private with a door, while your space is in=
 the middle, divided from the other studio with a partial wall, which goe=
s all the way up to the ceiling. There are no windows, but abundant wall =
space and a small storage loft. Perfect for a painter.

The charming space has one exposed brick wall, and original details of wo=
od ceiling, beams and floor. It feels very comfortable and homey in there=
, great place to work. The photos feature my previous studiomates&#39; st=
uff, but it&#39;s best to take a look at it in person and see how you wou=
ld set it up yourself.

There is a freight elevator, mailbox, slop sink, clean bathrooms, and 24-=
hour access to building. Many artists and creative professionals in the b=
uilding.

Amazing, prime location, just 2 blocks from the G at Greenpoint Ave and w=
alking distance to tons of great bars, shops, and restaurants.

I prefer someone with a quiet practice - no woodworking (occasional is ok=
), loud machines, or toxic materials. It&#39;s also preferable if you wor=
k mostly nights and weekends since I work mostly weekdays, but not a requ=
isite. Also, I&#39;m only renting to an individual to keep the # of peopl=
e in the space to a minimum, no duos or groups. I require first month&#39=
;s rent plus 2 months security deposit. The lease is for one year, but if=
 you need to leave before then, you can give me 45 days notice.=20

$300.00 Per Month, Williamsburg/Bushwick, Brooklyn, 610 sq. ft., Studio a=

Available: Jan 01, 2015

Hi!
I&#39;m looking for one more studio-mate to share a 610sq ft studio with =
3 puppet and set builders.=20
4 blocks from the Grand L stop, about 6 blocks from the Graham L stop.
Freight elevator, loading dock, 24 hr access, wireless internet
Basement studio with 2 large studios
Shared bathroom and slop sink on our floor.=20
12 ft ceilings.

My studio-mates and I share a power tool table with a bandsaw, belt sande=
r, dremel, drill press, table saw, welder, sewing machines, serger, etc. =
You are welcome to use these and store your own power tools here as long =
as you know how to properly use these kinds of tools safely.=20

We also use spray paints, adhesives and do some casting and molding, so t=
his studio is not ideal for someone with a lot of chemical sensitivity, e=
ven though we ventilate properly while using chemicals.=20

We are all pretty laid back, and very clean unless in the death-throes of=
 deadlines, and very respectful of eachother&#39;s tools.  We each have o=
ur own work tables and storage area, but we&#39;re really not that uptigh=
t about it if there are occasionally larger projects as long as they can =
be planned for.=20

We work collaboratively on larger projects together and are looking for a=
 responsible, clean 4th person who might be able to contribute complement=
ary skills. Ideally, this would be a long-term studio share for the right=
 person, with one months notice if you choose to leave.=20
The rent is $300/month plus we split the utility bills 4 ways (about $25/=
mo), plus 1 months security deposit to move in.=20
Thanks!

$480.00 Per Month, Bushwick, Brooklyn, New York, 550 sq. ft., Well locate=
d Bushwick studio for share
Available: Dec 15, 2014 through Dec 31, 2015

Looking to share my work studio space with TWO other studio mates who are=
 friendly, respectful, responsible (of our belongings and the space) and =
comfortable working in a shared environment. It is around 550 sq.ft for $=
1450 (this is actual cost with absolutely no profit margins. The cost inc=
ludes heat even on weekends!). We can either portion the spaces into thre=
e or work on days we can come in to use the whole space. In this case you=
r portion of the rent will be: $480 (plus electricity). I am also willing=
 to sub-lease the whole space if I dont find anyone for studio share by t=
his month.  In that case you will have the place to yourself 99% of the t=
ime, as I will be using it primarily as storage only.=20

The studio is in an amazing, prime location, just two blocks from the L a=
t Morgan Ave with a caf, bar, restaurant and event space right below the =
building. The ceilings are 11 high, so it feels larger. The space has two=
 massive windows with tons of light on one end of the studio and its a bi=
t dark on the other end (I dont mind occupying this end of the studio) bu=
t the whole space is very provided with lights. There is a freight elevat=
or, mailbox, slop sink, clean bathrooms, and 24-hour access to building. =
There are many artists and creative professionals in the building.

I would prefer no use of massive equipment that creates lots of noise or =
use of toxic materials in the space. I require 2 months security deposit.=
 The lease is for one year, but if you need to leave before then, you nee=
d to give 45 days notice.
Please email for more details, and little info about yourself and the typ=
e of art practice you have.

$440.00 Per Month, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, Beautiful and light filled studi=
o sublet in great neighborhood
Available: Jan 01, 2015 through Feb 08, 2015

I am a documentary filmmaker and I have a lovely, spacious and light fill=
ed studio in Greenpoint. I will be away from January 1st - Feb 8th and am=
 looking to sublet during that time.=20

The studio is large and is split between me and my studio mate, Lina. We =
are both computer based (I&#39;m mainly editing and she is an architectur=
al renderer and animator) and have large desks on opposite sides of the r=
oom, each with our own window. There is also a communal space with a couc=
h and a coffee table. It&#39;s so large and schedules are so varied, that=
 you either have the space to yourself or it feels like you do. It is def=
initely a place that is better suited to someone who is desk and/or compu=
ter based like a writer, animator, programmer, editor, etc.=20

The studio is in the great neighborhood of northern Greenpoint with tons =
of artists, coffee shops, great lunch places, and is easy to get to from =
the train or bus. The studio building has a bunch of amenities: a patio, =
a gallery space, a conference room, couches, a kitchen, an elevator, etc.=
 It&#39;s very secure and filled with a great community of professional a=
rtists.=20

Happy to answer any questions and let me know if you are interested and w=
e can discuss timing and price and all that jazz, as I&#39;d be willing t=
o sublet for just a portion of the time or whatever works best.=20

Thanks!

$825.00 Per Month, Bushwick, NY, 950 sq. ft., Beautiful Converted 3 br Lo=
ft Space with one opening up.
Available: Jan 01, 2015 through Jun 30, 2015

 Awesome Room in Awesome Apartment with Awesome People


The Apartment:
A fully furnished, 950 sq. ft., 3-bedroom apartment with 12 ft. ceilings,=
 smack dab between the Montrose and Morgan stops off the L. We have a dis=
hwasher AND laundry in the building (I know!). Lots to do in the area: ba=
rs, coffeeshops, fancy restaurants, not-so-fancy restaurants, music and a=
rt venues, flea markets, kind of grimy parks. &lt;5-minute walk to the tr=
ain, and a 20-minute ride to Union Sq.

The Room:
Modestly sized at approx. 8x15ft, but tall ceilings and 9-foot wall-to-wa=
ll windows make it feel much bigger. Room has a ceiling fan, as well as i=
ndividually controlled AC and heat. Unless you have a ton of stuff (in wh=
ich case you probably arent the ideal roommate for us), you should fit ve=
ry comfortably. Rent is $825 a month and includes gas, water, cable inter=
net and a bi-weekly cleaning lady (shes awesome). Basically everything bu=
t electric  (which is split three ways) is included.

The Roommates:
There are two of us looking to replace the third. Him: a high school teac=
her  early 30s in the larger room. Her: marketing and branding in the mus=
ic industry in a room approx. the same size as yours.=20

We like each other a bunch, and would like to keep the current open, cons=
iderate, and tidy environment going strong. We all have big kid jobs, but=
 our hours are slightly staggered, so sometimes well go for a few days wi=
thout seeing each other. We dont party in the house (though we are all so=
cial drinkers/ nonsmokers) but we do occasionally have roof parties (the =
roof is ginormous), mainly in the summer.

You:
You do you  as long as you&#39;re nice, and not dumb, or too noisy, and c=
an respect other peoples boundaries. People who like music and books and =
sports and art and math and .gifs and food and beer and wine are especial=
ly encouraged to apply. Were all generally out of the house between 7am a=
nd 7pm, so it would be nice if you kept a similar schedule (although we a=
ll share a bathroom, so maybe not too similar).=20

The $$$:
Youll need first, last and one month security to move in (First roommate =
test: $825x3=3D?) Rent is due on the first of the month and includes gas,=
 water, cable internet and a bi-weekly cleaning lady (again, shes awesome=
).

$1,025.00 Per Month, Bedstuy/Clinton Hill border, Brooklyn/NY, Room for r=
ent Jan. 1 in luxury loft building! Great amenities!
Available: Jan 01, 2015

Hi there:

My current roommate is moving out and I am looking for someone to take ov=
er her spot.

It is a loft-style apartment (two bedroom, one bath) located on Kosciuszk=
o St. between Bedford Ave. and Nostrand. It is 3 blocks from the G train =
stop at Bedford-Nostrand and about a 30 minute commute to the Financial D=
istrict. The building has a sweet roof deck with a view of the Manhattan =
skyline, a gym, laundry on site, and a rec room.

About me, I&#39;m a 30 year-old attorney with a very busy schedule which =
means we won&#39;t see each other much during the work week. I pay my bil=
ls on time and generally have my life together. I&#39;m looking for a roo=
mmate who&#39;s at that same stage of his/her life, meaning, you pay your=
 bills on time, you don&#39;t bring the party home, and you clean after y=
ourself. No drugs, no pets. Other than that, I&#39;m pretty respectful an=
d easygoing.=20

Rent is $2050 a month, split two ways. Utilities are not included but the=
y are usually about $100. You would need first, last, and a security depo=
sit to move in ($3,075). It is a one year lease and both our names would =
be on it. There is a $50 application/credit check fee. If you are interes=
ted and it sounds like a good fit, please send me an email and we&#39;ll =
set up a time for you to see the place.

Spacious Apartment
Available: Jan 01, 2015

One room in a beautiful and sunny two-bedroom apartment is available for =
rent starting on January 1st (a few days earlier would also be possible).=
 We&#39;re looking for someone to stay at least two months, with the opti=

The apartment itself is spacious and gorgeous, with exposed brick walls, =
a skylight in the living room over the dining table, east and west exposu=
res, and lots of plants. The bedroom is in the back of the building so it=
 is quiet, you can see the sunrise and hear birds from the bed. In the af=
ternoons the sun fills the living room.

You&#39;d be sharing the apartment with a relaxed and clean 28-year-old f=
emale art student, and then also her boyfriend starting in March. The roo=
m is opening up because our current roommate is moving out of the States,=
 so her bed is also available if you need one. Both of us have busy lives=
 and have friends over occasionally but generally prefer to relax at home=
 and see friends out. We&#39;re both friendly and currently cook and shar=
e meals with our current roommate but also are all respectful of each oth=
er&#39;s space and privacy. There are two desks in the living room so who=
ever moves in could have a workspace either out there or in their room if=
 they were interested.=20

The apartment is conveniently located one block from the Clinton-Washingt=
on stop on the C train and 2 blocks from the Clinton-Washington stop on t=
he G. It is about a ten minute walk Atlantic Terminal where you can get m=
any of the other trains. Bike parking and laundry are available in the ba=
sement. There are grocery stores and bodegas on Fulton Street which is a =
block away, and lots of nice restaurants and bars nearby. We are walking =
distance to the Brooklyn Flea market and a short bike ride or a walk to F=
ort Greene and Prospect Park.

Hello Everyone,

Looking for a new roommate to share my lovely apartment.=20

 to. =20

There is laundry in the basement, a live-in superintendent; it&#39;s a ve=
ry chilled, cozy, and convenient space to live in  - the neighborhood has=
 lots of awesome little spots to eat, drink and dance and is five minutes=
 walk from three subway stops (Bowery, Spring Street, Grand Street).

About me...

$1,450.00 Per Month, Williamsburg/Greenpoint, Brooklyn, Large Well Furnis=
hed Bedroom with Private Living Room
Available: Jan 01, 2015 through Apr 01, 2015

Hello,=20

Im looking to sublet my room in a large two bedroom apartment right in th=
e heart of Williamsburg and Greenpoint while Im away in Los Angeles.   Th=
e bedroom gets lots of light, has 10ft tall ceilings, a queen size bed, a=
 desk, theres a 40 inch (netflix, hulu, etc) tv and the bedroom itself is=
 much larger than your typical New York apartment.  The room also include=
s an attached, completely private, personal living room with a big couch,=
 tv, and bookshelves which can be cleared if you need storage and theres =
a decent sized closet for your stuff.  With the bedroom and your own livi=
ng room, you really get maximum privacy in this apartment.

The kitchen is a good size, its fully stocked with all the cookware and c=
ounter space you could need.  A nice big window lets in lots of light to =
enjoy while you sit at the kitchen table.  The bathroom is well, your bas=
ic bathroom, a shower with good pressure and thats stays hot, a toilet, s=
pace to keep your stuff, and most importantly, its clean.

You would be sharing the apartment with my very sweet, quiet, and respect=
ful,  good female friend.  She is a 30 year old who works a regular 9-6  =
Monday- Friday type job nearby.  Her boyfriend often stays here, but the =
apartment is so large and spread out (they also have their own living roo=
m) you hardly will know anyone else is even here.  They keep to themselve=
s, and rarely if ever have company.

The price includes all utilities and wifi.  I have some flexibility with =
dates so if thats an issue lets talk.  Its a nice, clean, large happy pla=
ce to be type apartment, which can be rare in NY.  Hope to hear from you =
soon!

Nick

Available: Jan 15, 2015 through May 01, 2015

Up for rent is one bedroom in our large 3 bedroom apartment located right=
 off the Nostrand A/C train station. The room is really big, quiet, has h=
ard wood floors, and still has the original mantel from when these homes =
used to have fireplaces. It also has two big windows that overlook the ba=
ckyard, enough room for at least 2-3 dressers, a queen size bed, and with=
 space to still walk around.=20

Everyone says this, but this apartment is a real gem. Our kitchen is mass=
ive and all of the appliances are no more than a year old. We even have o=
ur own washer and dryer in the apartment which is just one of the great t=
hings about this place. The living room and dining room are so big that w=
e&#39;re still trying to fill them with furniture and art (please help us=
!).=20

My roommate and I are both females in our mid-20s and are looking for som=
eone in that age range (or at least under 35) and of either gender. Some =
things we enjoy: music, art, film, working out, eating, cooking, drinking=
 with friends, going out on the town, watching Broad City. We&#39;re 420 =
friendly and cool with you having an active social life - just try to not=
 bring it home all the time. The one thing we are really looking for is s=
omeone who is really clean and likes to keep a clean apartment - we do a =
big clean every 2 weeks and we&#39;ve never had any bugs, mice, nothing. =
Also looking for someone who wants to hang with us and be friends - and n=
ot just live here as a stranger.=20

You will be taking over the lease for a current roommate who is moving ou=
t, and the start date is January 15th - but could also be started on Feb.=
 1 if needed. The rent does not include utilities - which are gas, electr=
icity and Internet (doesn&#39;t usually run more than $60 a person). The =
lease goes until May 1, 2015, and you will need first month&#39;s rent ($=
935) and a security deposit ($935) to move in. If this sounds cool to you=
, send us an email and tell us about yourself!=20

$1,200.00 Per Month, Prospect Lefferts Gardens, Brooklyn, One Bedroom one=
 bathroom available in a three bedroom apt
Available: Dec 01, 2014 through May 31, 2015

Hello there! My roommate and I are currently searching for a new roommate=
 to fill the third bedroom and second bathroom in our apartment. We are i=
deally looking for someone who can finish out the lease with us on May 31=
 (with the option of possibly staying on beyond if it&#39;s the right fit=
) but there is flexibility on the move-in date. You can move in any time =
between December 1 and 31. Your room has two big western facing windows a=
nd a full size closet. The room is 9&#39;8&quot;x14&#39;3&quot; so it can=
 accommodate a big bed, a dresser, and desk. It comes with an almost new =
window unit air conditioner. There is exposed brick along one wall.

The apartment was renovated a year and a half ago so it has nice new wood=
 floors, new appliances in the kitchen, including a full sized dishwasher=
. There is also laundry in the basement. We are close by to grocery store=
s and coffee shops. Prospect Park is about a ten minute walk away and we =
are near to the entrance to the new skating rink as well as the Botanic G=
arden. We like to shop at the Grand Army Plaza farmer&#39;s market on Sat=
urdays and drop off our compost there as well.=20

About us: we are two women in our mid 20s. My roommate works in an office=
 9-6 on weekdays. I have a hectic schedule as an actor so the two of us u=
nfortunately don&#39;t overlap at home too often. This makes for a pretty=
 quiet and cozy apartment life. When we are home together, we like to wat=
ch movies and make delicious (mostly vegetarian) dinners and are looking =
for someone who wants a similar low-key home life. If this sounds like so=
mething you&#39;re interested in, please reach out to us!

$700.00 Per Month, Park Slope, Brooklyn, 9.5 x 6.5ft sq. ft., Small Priva=
te Room Available in the Heart of Park Slope
Available: Dec 17, 2014 through Apr 01, 2015

Hello! Our apartment is located in a brownstone just four blocks from Pro=
spect Park on a beautiful tree lined street. It&#39;s close to many subwa=
ys (primarily the 2,3,r,q,b if needed f,g,n) and the atlantic terminal tr=
ain station so getting around is pretty simple.  We are on the top floor =
and have easy roof access with a super sexy view of the city. The kitchen=
 space and eating area are large and great for food prep. I cook a lot an=
d am a big foodie! That said, we hope to find a roomie/sublet who cares a=
bout healthy living. We are members at the Park Slope Food Coop which is =
conveniently located two blocks away. There is a beautiful donation based=
 yoga studio within a 10 minute walk (if you are into that) and tons of r=
estaurants and bars in the area.

The room is on the smaller side, 9.5 x 6.6 ft, but has built in storage s=
pace and a window. It is semi-furnished with a twin bed and desk.  I shou=
ld mention that one of the three bedrooms is railroad, BUT this does not =
affect the available room, which is private. My roommate and I are both a=
rtists and use the front room as a studio space. Because of this, the kit=
chen and dining room serve as important communal areas. We do our best to=
 be clean and tidy but not obsessively so.=20

A little bit about me:  I create drawings depicting the body. As my day j=
ob, I cater / sell veggies at the farmers market / whatever it takes.  I =
enjoy yoga, cooking and love plants.

My roommate: Makes sculptural paintings with found objects. She currently=
 works as an artist&#39;s assistant and sometimes travels for it.

Potential roommate: Since the apartment is fully-furnished we are ideally=
 looking for someone with minimal stuff. Travelers welcome! We would real=
ly love to find another artist (or creative type) as a third roomie, but =
because of the room size, it would be best if the roommate to has their o=
wn studio space. Although short term sublets (3-6 months) are preferred, =
we are open to longer if the situation is right. We have really enjoyed h=
aving short term sublets and have come across an incredible mix of intere=
sting people along the way! Also, we love animals but can&#39;t accept an=
y pets at this time.=20

In addition to rent, the utilities are split evenly among roommates total=
ing around $60 a month (internet, gas, electric).

$1,250.00 Per Month, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, 110 sq. ft., Great Room In An =
Amazing Pre-War Greenpoint Apartment
Available: Dec 31, 2014 through Mar 31, 2015

Unfurnished 8&#39;x13&#39; room available in a 3 bedroom apartment in the=
 heart of Greenpoint.  Located 1 block from the Greenpoint Ave G Train st=
op.  The apartment has great proximity to all the wonderful eating, drink=
ing, and shopping establishments that Geenpoint and Williamsburg have to =
offer.  It is walking distance to McKarren Park, the Bedford L stop, and =
6 blocks from the East River Ferry.

The room is large enough for a queen sized bed, desk, and a dresser.  It =
has an inset shelving nook and a 4&#39; deep closet.  There is also a clo=
set directly outside the room for storage.

The apartment is spacious and has all the charms of a prewar building.  A=
rched doorways, crown molding, and hardwood floors throughout.  The kitch=
en and bathroom have skylights so that each room gets great sun.  The liv=
ing room is abnormally large and is filled with plants.  The apartment is=
 on the 3rd floor of a 3 story building, and has a lovely roof where we g=
arden, relax, and watch sunsets when the weather is forgiving.

We are 2 gentlemen in our early thirties who work in photography and occa=
sionally ride our skateboards.  We like to keep the apartment quite clean=
 and would expect the same from our room mate.  Cleaning up after yoursel=
f, helping with the upkeep, and respecting each others schedules is an ab=
solute necessity.  We do not want anyone with pets or a live-in significa=
nt other.  Gainful employment that takes place outside the home is also m=
andatory.

 Electric, Gas, and Internet are split 3 ways.

Look forward to hearing from you.

Bedford L train

This is for one private room of a 2 BR, 1 bath, spacious, and new apartme=
nt located in the heart of the vibrant artistic community of Williamsburg=
, Brooklyn. We&#39;re located on the same block as the Bedford L stop so =
it&#39;s extremely convenient for getting around -- you can get to Union =
Square in 5 minutes and we&#39;re only 1 stop away from Manhattan. I&#39;=
ll be in South America and Antarctica for 2 months from January 18 - Marc=
h 22, so those are the dates that the room is available. I&#39;m asking f=
or $3,200 for the duration of 1/18 - 3/22, which comes out to $1,600 a mo=
nth for 2 months. You would be potentially sharing the apartment with ano=
ther guest. I&#39;m also asking for a security deposit of $800.

The room contains a double bed. The place is bright and clean and in a gr=
eat area -- close enough to Bedford, Metropolitan, or Grand to enjoy all =
of the amazing bars, cafes, and restaurants, but just a touch off of the =
main drag to provide a semblance of peace. Also, if you like movies and/o=
r independent cinema, there are some great movie theaters within walking =
distance of our apartment. We are also 5 blocks from the waterfront, wher=
e you can experience some of the best views of the Manhattan skyline and =
also the Brooklyn Flea market and Smorgasburg food festival on the weeken=
ds.

Fresh linens and towels are provided, there is high speed internet and ca=
ble, central AC. Free coffee and tea are available upon request. In addit=
ion, I would be more than happy to provide information about the area or =
Manhattan or help out in whatever way we can.

There&#39;s ample desk and table space in case you want to hook up a lapt=
op and work for a while. Last but not least, our apartment building has a=
 rooftop!

If you need any recommendations, you can ask me and I&#39;ll do my best t=
o help you enjoy the city!

$1,000.00 Per Month, ridgewood/bushwick, new york, 2 Rooms in Very Large =
Renovated Industrial Space in Ridgewood/Bushwick
Available: Dec 01, 2014 through Apr 30, 2015

We lease a very large space that used to be a factory (living/dining room=
 are 55x26x11) and have 2 rooms available January 1st (or possibly sooner=
): 10x9x11 lofted room with big window and bed included if needed  and a =
12x11x11 lofted room with 2 very large windows. The whole house gets tons=
 of sunlight with 4 windows and a skylight in the common areas as well.  =
We are in Ridgewood just across the border from Bushwick.

Both rooms are available for four months (a shorter or longer stay can be=
 discussed.)

Ideally, we&#39;re looking for someone who can appreciate the massive spa=
ce and put it to use. It&#39;s an event space, so you could have an art o=
pening, teach a class, have a performance art type show, movie screening,=
 photography/film shoot, etc. We are currently under construction downsta=
irs building a recording studio.

The space is large and gets dirty quickly.  You need to be pro-active abo=
ut cleaning so that we can all enjoy the space that we share.  If we all =
do a little bit more than we think is expected well all be happy.

One thing to note: The massive space does not get especially warm in the =
harsh winter months. We have only 2 radiators in the communal area which =
does not retain heat very well at all. Expect to wear layers and sweaters=
. The bedrooms each have a radiator and we&#39;ll provide a supplemental =
electric heater if needed.

About us:

Roommates #1 &amp; #2 (couple) live downstairs and are constructing the s=
tudio. We both work in film (in the field mixing and booming, in the stud=
io post-production) and we play in our duo band (whatpreytell.bandcamp.co=
m) We&#39;re young at 26 &amp; 29, ambitious, drink sometimes, smoke some=
times, and like to throw a show out of the event space in the winter time=
. We practice about twice to 5 times a month and only during the day time=
 hours so it doesn&#39;t disturb anyone&#39;s slumber. We are fun, easy-g=
oing and very busy!

Roommate #3 is a sound guy. He works a lot, but you&#39;ll see him in the=
 afternoons. He&#39;s a cheeky sort of chap, a little older (something li=
ke 35) but young at heart. Very very fun to be around when he&#39;s had a=
 few. Loves to play chess. A good guy.

Roommates #4 &amp; #5 are a friendly couple. She&#39;s a bartender/waitre=
ss who likes to hoola hoop and he manages the seafood station at whole fo=
ods. I don&#39;t see them but once a week on average and usually late at =
night after they get off work.

Roommate #6 works a lot but is very knowledgeable in technology and compu=
ters. He&#39;s also a dj by night. Fun great awesome guy.

Roommate#7 works 2 jobs and goes to school so we hardly ever see her.  Sh=
e goes to school for fashion.

We all love to play vinyls. Sometimes we put a movie on the projector at =
night. We all do our part to keep the communal spaces neat and clean. Bug=
s and rodents are a non-issue. We have 1.5 bathrooms. We smoke our cigs o=
utside. The vibe here is free &amp; chill, and we hope to maintain that. =
 It isn&#39;t a party house by any stretch- it is a home, but we have our=
 friends over sometimes and it can get a little loud.  We all try our bes=
t to be respectful and communicative about our needs.  All I really mean =
is, if the record is playing too loudly or voices are up, just say so!  W=
e appreciate communication.=20

No furry pets- allergies!

We&#39;re a 3 block walk from the L train stop Dekalb stop-- Post office,=
 shops, supermarket, dollar stores, beer distributors, &amp; laundromats =
are all within short walking distance! The M train is a short 9 blocks aw=
ay as well as the B38 bus around the corner takes you to downtown Brookly=
n in 20 mins!  If you have a bicycle, we have plenty of space for you to =
park it inside.

First month, last month rent, and deposit are required to move in. That&#=
39;s $3,000.  A great deal for someone who has an appreciation and use fo=
r so much communal event space.  Again, the rooms can be furnished with b=
eds as well as shelving and anything else you might need.  Just ask!  The=
 rent does not include utilities, which runs about $70-$90 per person.

Please make your subject line &quot;[Your name] in Space!.&quot;

$1,800.00 Per Month, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, Opportunity in Greenpoint
Available: Dec 11, 2014 through Dec 10, 2015


Lots of space, a huge backyard, a unique opportunity in Greenpoint.

Available now or as soon as possible.

It&#39;s the first floor apartment of a three-family house near McGorlick=
 Park. Rental is by the owner, me. I bought this property as an investmen=
t in 1986, lived here a few years, then moved to Brazil and other address=
es until I returned about two years  ago. I live on the second floor now.=
=20

Although I renovated the second and third floor apartments years ago, I&#=
39;ve hardly touched this apartment. It has high ceilings, five windows, =
a large closet, a working kitchen, a bathroom with shower and two separat=
e entrances. Internet and the shared backyard are included in the rent.

The apartment is spacious, but it&#39;s a floor-through/railroad rather t=
han a &quot;true&quot; two bedroom. Two adult maximum. Applicants with ha=
ndyman/construction skills are most welcome, but I will not accept work i=
n exchange for rent. Apartment needs TLC. You can use as art studio, tear=
 down outer wall to expose brick, paint own colors, get creative w space =
as long as I OK. I&#39;ll pay materials.

The new third floor tenants are determined to plant, compost, and reap in=
 the backyard. There&#39;s plenty of room for another gardener who sees t=
he untamed backyard as a great opportunity.

The neighborhood is sweet, quiet, and very safe. There&#39;s a laundromat=
 on the corner and many coffee shops, restaurants, and mom &amp; pop groc=
ers nearby. You can walk to Williamsburg in 15 minutes, join the exciteme=
nt, and return to tranquility. The Nassau Ave. G-subway stop is .6 miles =
away and the Graham Ave. L stop is .9 mile&#39;s away. The B48 bus stops =
at my corner and takes you straight to the Lorimer L-train. A taxi to or =
from Penn Station is about $22 + tip, less if you&#39;re going downtown. =
But for local travel, biking is best.

Rent is $1800/month. One month security plus last month&#39;s rent (=3D $=
3,600) with signing of lease. First month&#39;s rent before move-in.

Cats are welcome. Dogs are a possibility with an extra fee.

Please respond with an email that tells me a about yourself(selves).

Thanks!

$2,500.00 Per Month, Bed Stuy / Bushwick, Brooklyn, 1200 sq. ft., Huge ap=
t in gorgeous building in Bed Stuy / Bushwick
Available: Jan 01, 2015

2 bedroom apt for rent only a few blocks from the JMZ line right on the b=
order of Bedstuy and Bushwick. The building is from the 1930s and remaine=
d a factory up until 2009 when it was gutted and converted into a 4 floor=
 apartment. Before us, not a single person had ever lived here. Therefore=
, the space is still in great condition and the landlord continues to ren=
ovate it quite regularly. He just recently had the entry and stairwells r=
epainted and installed chandeliers and new light fixtures. Wood floors th=
roughout!

Bedroom #1 =3D The hugest bedroom you will ever see in all of NYC. This r=
oom is not a traditional square box. It has about 15 walls altogether. Th=
is room is in the back of the apt and overlooks backyard space. It was me=
ant to be broken up into 2 or 3 smaller rooms, but during renovation 5 ye=
ars ago, the builder decided to leave it whole.
-19ft x 15ft
-2 closets
-2 windows
-wood floors

Bedroom #2 =3D Smaller, but still spacious. This room is quite long and n=
arrow. It is just wide enough to fit a bed sideways, but certainly you co=
uld arrange furniture in a variety of configurations. It would also make =
a fine office or guest bedroom. It overlooks Broadway and the J and has t=
wo thick panes of glass for additional soundproofing.
-23ft x 7ft
-1 closet
-1 window
-wood floors

Living room/dining/kitchen =3D Spacious and filled with natural light. Th=
e kitchen opens up into the living room which makes the space feel even l=
arger. We&#39;ve played around with several configurations of couch/dinin=
g table/lounge chairs/projector/bookcases/etc. The kitchen has a stainles=
s steel refrigerator and stove. The cabinet and counter space is also qui=
te generous. Wood floors and a tiled section in the kitchen.

Bathroom is tiled floor to ceiling with a standard sized bathtub/sink/toi=
let. Bathroom also has a generously sized closet which we used to store l=
inens, bath products, extra furniture, etc. Second generously sized close=
t in hallway which is great for cleaning supplies and extra furniture. A =
total of 5 closets in apartment, not to mention the basement.....

Basement storage space is unbelievably spacious and so great to have acce=
ss to!

The neighborhood is awesome. Laundromat across the street, deli on corner=
, organic market a few blocks away, near the Broadway/Myrtle stop on JMZ =
line, near the B38, B46, B47, etc, three great bars close by (Goodbye Bue=
 Monday, Lone Wolf, Gallery), sweet neighbors, bikable, tons of brunch op=
tions, etc etc.=20

We have lots more photos - both furnished ones as well as unfurnished so =
as to give you a sense of the overall space and perspective. Just ask.

We lived in two separate buildings with this landlord for the past 8 year=
s and he has always been dependable, friendly, and responsive. He comes h=
ighly recommended! I currently live in this apartment but am also in the =
process of relocating to Greenpoint. I have lived in this apartment for f=
ive years and have had this same landlord for eight years, so I am helpin=
g him to find a new tenant.

There are no fees, no credit checks, no applications, no brokers.

We&#39;re able to show the apartment on weekdays (typically after 5) and =
anytime on weekends. This space is incredible and will not last, so pleas=
e be in touch and we&#39;ll get right back to you!

$2,690.00 Per Month, East Harlem, New York, Unique East Harlem 2 BR/1.5BA=
 Duplex (convertible to 3 BR) (with private patio, roof deck)
Available: Dec 01, 2014

Rent: $2690/month. No fee.=20
Bedrooms: 2 (convertible to 3)
Bathrooms: 1.5

Location: 164 East 112th Street (btw. 3rd &amp; Lexington). The apartment=
 is on the ground floor, in the back -- makes for a very easy move in.=20=


Commuting: It&#39;s 2 blocks from the 6 train 110th street stop -- very c=
onvenient to get out and get on the subway in the morning. We are also a =
few avenues over from the 2/3 110th street stop (about a 10 minute walk).=


Why it&#39;s great:=20
On the main level: both bedrooms, the kitchen and dining area, a closet f=
or coats, and the main bathroom (which has a lovely stand-up glass-enclos=
ed shower). Off one bedroom is a private patio area which is really lovel=
y. Both bedrooms have big spacious closets and easily fit a queen bed (or=
 larger).

There&#39;s also a huge lower level that can be converted to a 3rd bedroo=
m OR used as a living room, guest room, rec room, office, etc. -- and als=
o has a decent-sized half-bathroom.

From that level there&#39;s access to the basement of the building with e=
asy bike storage, laundry room, trash &amp; recycling, as well as additio=
nal storage for the unit.

The apt also has central a/c and heating and brand new appliances (includ=
ing a dishwasher), access to a gym in the building next door, and a very =
big rooftop decked out with nice furniture.

We are breaking our lease because one of us had to move out of New York u=
nexpectedly, but we really wish we could have stayed -- it is a fabulous =
place and we can&#39;t say enough nice things about it, the building, or =
the landlord.=20

This place is ideal for a family or for roommates. For the amount of spac=
e you get, this is a real bargain. I am not a broker. I am one of the cur=
rent tenants but I am not currently living there (I have moved into anoth=
er apartment). As I mentioned in the posting, one of our roommates unexpe=
ctedly had to move out of NYC and my other roommate and I could not affor=
d to stay in the apartment, so we are breaking the lease.=20

As we are breaking our lease, we need someone in right away, so if you ar=
e interested don&#39;t hesitate -- get in touch right away!

dson Valley? The snow is just falling, and it&#39;s going to be beautiful=
!

We&#39;re looking for like minded people for a long term share of our ful=

we&#39;d love to find a couple or single person to occupy the apartment T=
uesdays through Fridays.

I&#39;m a 38 year old service industry professional and my girlfriend is =
a pilates/gyrotonics instructor. We live primarily in the Fort Greene nei=
ghborhood of Brooklyn. I have a 10 year old son who lives near Hudson, th=
erefore we use the apartment every Friday night through Sunday night to v=
isit with him and get some peace from the city.

with character and a great record collection, you&#39;ve found it! Non-re=
spectful types need not apply. Good vibes only!

The apartment is rented as a one bedroom, but I can accommodate a single =
child in a second bedroom if necessary. If you are interested in the addi=
tional bedroom, just ask. Otherwise, the listing is for the single bedroo=
m.

Please reply with a brief description of yourself and how you are our per=

Guest Access
Subletters will have the entire apartment to themselves. Basically, you j=

The Neighborhood
This apartment is unique due to it&#39;s location. It&#39;s nicely nestle=
d between the heart of Williamsburg and Bushwick with easy access to Bed-=
Stuy. Access to 3 different train lines. Manhattan is only a short trip a=
way. It&#39;s three stops to get to SoHo if you want to do some serious s=
hopping.

The neighborhood itself is diverse, fun and a little more peaceful than s=
ome of the other areas immediately surrounding it. That being said, there=
 is a bar right across the street, McCarren Park a 15 minute walk, the Wi=
lliamsburg Cinemas just a 10 minute walk away, and more cafes, restaurant=
s &amp; shopping around than you can count on all fingers and toes combin=
ed. All walkable, and with a small town vibe within NYC. I love this loca=
tion because it&#39;s easy for me to explore all the different neighborho=
ods around.

Getting around
JMZ Hewes, G Broadway, L Lorimer
Conveniently located with access to 3 train lines. Just 2 blocks away fro=
m the JMZ Hewes stop (2 minute walk). 2 stops into Manhattan / 15 minutes=
 to LES or 20 minutes to SoHo. Also a 5 minute walk to the Broadway stop =
off the G train, and an 8 minute walk to the L train Lorimer stop.

Walking across the bridge into Manhattan takes an hour or biking across i=
s 20 minutes.

Other Things to Note
- A beautiful little park with a great view of the Williamsburg Bridge is=
 a 15 minute walk away on Grand St. &amp; Kent Ave.=20
- Laundry facility just across the street between S.3rd and S.4th St. on =
Hooper St.

e. It has a new bathroom and kitchen, separate dining room with French do=
ors, living room, two large bedrooms (one with a comfortable king bed, an=
d one book-lined office). This is an elevator building with laundry and t=
rash/recycling in the basement and a live-in super.

Our apartment has a cooks dream kitchen  completely furnished from whisks=
 to Kitchen Aid stand-up mixer, dishwasher, microwave, and great stove. O=
ur dining table seats eight. One bedroom is currently used as an office, =
but could easily be used for a bedroom with prior arrangement (we have a =
full-sized, comfortable sofa sleeper and a queen air mattress). The apart=
ment has Wi-fi and a Blu-Ray DVD player that streams Netflix, etc. The ap=
artment also has two bicycles (and helmets) that you are free to use (the=
 greenway bike path begins just two blocks away). We are a five-minute wa=
lk to the C (blue) and 1 (red) subway lines and are surrounded by coffee =
shops, restaurants, gyms, parks, groceries, and trees. We are 15 minutes =
from Columbia University and 25 minutes to downtown Manhattan. We prefer =
to rent for the entire month, although dates are negotiable, and we are o=
pen to weekly rentals.

Our place rents for $650, with the exception of the dates 12/22/14-1/5/14=
 when the price is $850 per week. This increase reflects peak season pric=
es and is still a great deal.

We require references (two) for our guests because you are asked to take =
care of our cat, Sweet Pea. Experience with animals as well as affection =
for them are things that we require.

 bike greenway, The Inwood and Columbia farmers markets, and The Cloister=
s. For a day trip or quick getaway, we have easy access to the George Was=

 River Line. You won&#39;t fight traffic to leave the city!

Getting around

We are only two blocks from the C (one stop transfer to A/D) and the 1 su=
bway lines, and endless bus options. Zipcars are close by and there is ea=
sy off-street parking.

Other Things to Note

We are looking for cat-loving guests and will enjoy our resident feline l=
ap cat. This includes daily feeding, kitty box cleaning, and petting. As =
we have said, we require references (two) that can attest to your experie=
nce with taking care of cats.

$1,100.00 Per Month, Manhattan, Brooklyn, NJ, Queens, NYC, Looking for an=
 awesome roommate or small apt
Available: Dec 15, 2014

Hello there,

I am looking for a place in New York City, room or small apt. I am lookin=
g for something permanent, at least a year. I am willing to pay up to $11=
00. The more included, the better.

Here is a little bit about myself. I&#39;m a college graduate (Yay!). I&#=
39;m 23. I have a Bachelors in Journalism and a Masters in Entertainment =
Business. My kitten&#39;s name is Manny declawed, litter box trained and =
loves people.=20

I have just accepted an internship at Press Here Publicity and BirchBox.=20=


My current living situation is that I&#39;m living in an apartment with m=
y classmate Corey in Michigan. We split everything down the middle and I =
think I&#39;ve been a really good roommate. If you&#39;d like a reference=
, I&#39;m sure he&#39;s more than willing to speak with you.=20

A little bit about me as a roommate. I&#39;m very clean but not a clean-f=
reak. I don&#39;t freak out when a glass is in the sink or anything. But =
I love coming to a clean home. Speaking of home, I am really into making =
a home ... a special homey home. I am really outgoing and love to talk. H=
owever, if you&#39;re not like that, it&#39;s cool. I can unwind in my ro=
om. I always pay my bills on time, sometimes in advance. I like to feel s=
ecure in my finances which is why I&#39;m willing to put a lump sum up fr=
ont. I don&#39;t like to worry.

I love to have a good time but I don&#39;t bring the party home as I see =
my home as a place of serenity. I&#39;m early riser and I&#39;m in bed by=
 10pm. I&#39;m an old lady during the week. I have an interest in fitness=
, movies (especially Disney and Pixar) and cooking. I love to cook and ha=
ve a bad habit of cooking for 4 people, so if you love to eat, that&#39;s=
 perfect. Overall, I think I&#39;m a pretty fun roommate. If you&#39;re i=
nterested send me an email, I&#39;d love to meet you!

Hope to hear from you soon,

Daniele

Cat for adoption, Upper East Side, NYC, Meow the Cat Needs a Home
Available: Dec 10, 2014

Meow (aka Yowie / Maui / The Yow) is an A.S.P.C.A. cat. We fostered him f=
or 3 months, but now he&#39;s back at the shelter and needs a permanent h=
ome. =20

Meow took a couple of days to settle in and then grew more and more comfo=
rtable and affectionate. I&#39;d describe him best as a loyal cat. Every =
night when we came home, he greeted us at the front door with head butts =
and purring. When we left the apartment in the morning, he stood at the e=
nd of the corridor and genuinely looked upset that we were going out with=
out him. He&#39;s independent, he won&#39;t demand constant attention, bu=
t if you move from the kitchen to the lounge, he&#39;ll follow you and ta=
ke up position at the end of the couch. He likes to be around you, but in=
 his own space. He won&#39;t jump up on your lap, but he likes to be pick=
ed up and hugged  he&#39;ll purr for a while, then wriggle himself out wh=
en it&#39;s time to put him down. He slept on the corner of our bed at ni=
ght, he slept on my desk next to me during the day. I don&#39;t think Meo=
w is a fit with small children  we&#39;ve had kids in our apartment and h=
e doesn&#39;t seem to react well. Meow is great fun to play with; he can =
jump at least 3 times his own considerable height and makes a heck of a n=
oise when he runs after a toy ... he has huge paws. He&#39;s a wonderful =
cat and will be a great friend to somebody who can give him the love, com=
panionship and copious amount of cat food that he needs.
