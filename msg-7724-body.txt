$445.00 Per Month, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, 200 sq. ft., Spacious &amp; Ligh=
t studio share in a wonderful neighborhood
Available: Oct 01, 2014 through Apr 01, 2015

I'm looking for a studio mate to share my wonderful, spacious and sunny s=
tudio in Greenpoint, starting October 1st.=20

The studio is just off the Greenpoint stop on the G train. It's in a wond=
erfully low-key yet well run building full of artists. The building has c=
ommunal spaces, kitchens, an outdoor patio, a gallery, a conference room,=
 an elevator, mailboxes, and an office which receives packages (super hel=
pful). There's some more information and photos about the building on the=
ir fb page (www.facebook.com/groups/wearejava) and website (www.java-stud=
ios.com).=20

The studio is about 200 sq feet and we would split it 50/50. There's grea=
t wifi (and we also have an ethernet connection for faster uploads) and t=
he people who run the building are super responsive and helpful. It's won=
derfully light and airy in the studio with a pretty remarkable view from =
the two large windows. In the photographs your side would be on the left =
which looks cluttered in the pics but will be unfurnished and clean and t=
idy when my studio mate leaves at the end of the month. Rent is $445/mont=
h and that includes utilities. Move in is deposit ($445) and 1st months r=
ent. End date is flexible.=20

I'm a documentary filmmaker and editor. I freelance full time out of the =
studio so I'm often there. I also travel quite a lot - at least a week a =
month. I work mainly by myself but occasionally have meetings in the stud=
io. I work quite quietly as I'm often editing. I'm a very considerate and=
 open person, but I also tend to need quite a lot of focus time.

Ideally I would share the space with someone who has similar work habits =
to me, and it probably works best for someone who is pretty computer base=
d. But I'm also pretty open to suggestions and am looking forward to reva=
mping the studio and setting it up in a way that works best for us both.=20=


Let me know if you have any questions!
Thanks

 the northern end of Manhattan Ave in Greenpoint. This is a private and p=
rofessional studio (no classes are taught here) where a group of about tw=
enty artists and makers practice their craft either part-time or full-tim=
e.=20
This sublet includes 24/7 access to:=20
- 6'x3' work table and 1.5'x3'x6' shelving storage unit=20
- 4 pottery wheels=20
- 3 kilns=20
- spray booth=20
- slab roller and extruder=20
- studio glazes=20
- a clean, tidy, and large shared kitchen space=20
- wifi=20
We also order our ceramic supplies together in order to save on shipping =
expenses.=20
*Our studio is registered to participate in Greenpoint Open Studios (Octo=
ber 3-5) so this is a great, timely, added benefit of taking over the spa=
ce.=20
*Some working knowledge of ceramics is expected in order to join in, begi=
nner level college course or pottery class etc. is ok

enovated studio available Oct-June in Sunset Park
Available: Oct 07, 2014 through Jun 30, 2015

Looking to sublet my 450-square-foot studio in Sunset Park ($850 not incl=
uding utilities) starting the first week of October until the end of June=
 (with some flexibility in dates).=20

The studio has one wall of windows (southwestern-facing, so lots of light=
:)), built-in storage which is particularly good for painters (racks for =
paintings), and very high ceilings. Everything is brand new- the studios =
were just renovated, and I had mine painted just in July (one wall is whi=
te, the other a beautiful Wedgwood grey). My studio is located right next=
 to the bathrooms and the slopsink. The studios are in a warehouse buildi=
ng on the third floor, and the studio is quite beautiful. The community i=
s quiet, industrious and friendly. Hvac and heating are being installed r=
ight now so that will be brand new as well. Freight elevator, wifi, and t=
he building is 24-7.=20

I will leave the couch, microwave, desk, shelves, easy chair, and table b=
ehind (cleaning supplies, ladder, etc as well). I'm working until I leave=
, so the pictures show a lot of my stuff, but of course I'll move them by=
 the time you come in. Thank you.=20

$1,360.00 Per Month, East Village, New York, Cute Bedroom In Even Cuter 3=
-Bedroom With Chill Folk!
Available: Oct 01, 2014 through Jul 31, 2015

Hi, my name is Evan, I'm a 25-year-old fashion/entertainment writer for J=
ackThreads (yup, you'd be getting a fat discount!) who's, you guessed it,=
 looking to fill an open roommate. I'm gay too, if it matters.

About the place: It's a fifth floor walk-up on 7th Street between 1st &am=
p; 2nd Avenue. I've been living there for four years and there's a reason=
 I haven't moved out. We've got nice wood floors, a sizable kitchen with =
plenty of cabinet space, windows in every single room (one floor from the=
 top gives us robust natural sunlight), and a nicely sized common area wh=
ich is largely inhabited by my kitten, God, an eleven-month old bengal (h=
ypoallergenic!).

Your room: It's not giant, by any means, but it's not one of those closet=
 rooms you've likely taken a glance at. It can comfortably fit a full bed=
, has a nice sized closet (which includes overhead storage), as well as a=
n air conditioner (not like you'd be needing that much, but...).

Rent is $1360 + utilities, which come out to around $75 a month for each =
of us (which including HD, DVR, HBO, Starz, and Netflix on the 52&quot; T=
V you'll have access to in the living room), plus gas, electric, and high=
-speed internet.

There's a third roommate who just moved in named Anne, she's a maitre'd +=
 ballet dancer and very easy-going and easy to get along with.

I'm looking for someone kind, considerate, and clean (aren't we all?) but=
 also real and genuine about their expectations of the place. I'm also lo=
oking for someone that's not going to be home all the damn time (I'll tel=
l you about my former roommate over a cocktail).

Roommate must love cats (or like them, liking them is fine), be 420 frien=
dly, and that's about all folks.

The apartment is amazing and sun-filled with a cute balcony, and exposed =
brick wall. The living room and kitchen are one giant space, with an 8ft =
beautiful dining table and 2 couches. Since the place is so large, it's e=
asy to keep it looking clean, but we do make an effort to do so.=20

The bathroom has brand new fixtures, with a shower and bath, and a lot of=
 space as well.=20

There is laundry in the building, as well as a finished roof-deck overloo=
king the Manhattan skyline (We're just 3 blocks east of the river!)

About us: We are two ladies in our late 20s, early 30s, filmmaker and cre=
ative director. One of us has a 9-5, while the other has a freelancer sch=
edule.=20

We are looking for a respectful and beautiful third roommate who is a clo=
ne of our current roommate, Charles, and completes our ideal 'three's com=
pany' dynamic. He is hilarious, busy, has good taste, is tall and brings =
the occasional boy home. If you are not tall, don't worry, just be funny.=
=20

We're not looking for someone to be on the lease, but would prefer a more=
 permanent arrangement (as we can't compose these ads every month). Addit=
ionally, the room comes with the possibility of being furnished, since Ch=
arles is moving to LA to begin his budding movie career. Did we mention h=
e has good taste?=20

ally beautiful.=20

The location off the Wilson L stop on Schaefer at Evergreen. Luckily the =
J train is also in walking distance at the Chauncey stop. Additionally, t=
he A, C train are about 15-20 min walk to broadway junction, so it adds t=
rain options. It's about 20 minutes to Williamsburg and Greepoint. Ridgew=
ood is within walking distance which offers a lot of cute coffee shops, p=
astry spots, and restaurants. There's a really cool bar that just opened =
up called Houdini's on Decatur in walking distance. Also a wonderful coff=
ee shop called Norma's that is adorable with delicious breakfast sandwich=
es. Also you can bike to all the bars/cafe's off the Jefferson L train an=
d Morgan L train in less than 10 minutes. Each room has a closet and ther=
es great light in every bedroom room. Everything is totally new in the ki=
tchen and bathroom. Also the living room is a good size!=20

I have one cat who is about 3 years old. If you have a cat too that would=
 be great too, there's enough space for two!

I keep the apartment very clean and uncluttered. Also I do love to cook f=
rom time to time. I definitely enjoy hanging out in the morning on the po=
rch. Its a lovely way to start the day! I don't bring the party home and =
I'm looking for someone who feels the same.=20

Open to the idea of subletting the 3rd room out from time to time to help=
 with bills. Of course only as much as you'd be comfortable with. Each be=
droom has its own lock and key, btw.

As far as applying--must also have proof of income. $1450 a month. To mov=
e in first and last months rent only, no security!!

Truly looking forward to meeting you!

$1,400.00 Per Month, Lower East Side, New York, Adorable Room in Prime Lo=
wer East Side
Available: Oct 01, 2014

Sunny, adorable room available in a two bedroom apartment across the stre=
et from Seward Park on the Lower East Side.=20

In the heart of this exciting, bustling neighborhood, this is a lovely, q=
uiet block facing tree-filled Seward Park. A perfect mix of LES and China=
town, you can find the best dumplings, newest hip restaurants, and your n=
eighborhood dive all in a few-block radius. With Cafe Grumpy and a new ju=
ice bar right downstairs, and Beverly's and Clockwork bars just down the =
street (though out of earshot), this block is a friendly little neighborh=
ood all of its own.=20

My roommate is moving out at the end of September, and I am looking for s=
omeone to fill her place. The apartment is a third-floor walk-up with exp=
osed brick throughout, hardwood floors, a white tile bathroom, and air co=
nditioners in both the living room and your bedroom. The open bedroom is =
the larger of the two, with two sunny windows, a great cross-breeze, and =
your own private closet. The bedroom currently is semi-furnished, with a =
dresser and full size bed that you are welcome to use. I am also amenable=
 to replacing the current bed if you have your own, though the dresser wi=
ll stay.=20

About me: I am a female in her late twenties working in contemporary art.=
 I spend most of my time out of the house, both at work and otherwise, am=
 tidy, outgoing, and friendly.

About you: You are a mid-twenties to mid-thirties male or female (female =
preferred) who is clean, considerate, and friendly. There are plenty of p=
laces in the neighborhood to play, so as it is a cozy apartment I ask tha=
t you not bring the party home, as it were. No pets and no smoking in the=
 apartment.

The F train is less than a block away, the B and D trains about a five mi=
nute walk at Grand Street, and the J, M, and Z trains an equal walk to Es=
sex Street. Getting uptown, across town, to downtown Brooklyn, and Willia=
msburg/Bushwick is incredibly convenient.=20

Rent is $1400/month and utilities usually run about $40/month. First mont=
h and one month security deposit to move in. Long term commitment preferr=
ed.

$1,050.00 Per Month, Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, One bedroom available in =
a bright, shiny two-bedroom.
Available: Oct 01, 2014

I'm looking for a roommate to take the second bedroom in my sun-filled, t=
wo-bedroom apartment.
Details:
Available Oct 1.
Hardwood floors, granite counter-tops, dishwasher.
A/C's in every room.
Recently renovated space so it's super clean and nice inside.
Patio out back for grilling and whatnot!
There's also additional storage in a shed behind the apartment.
The bedroom is 10'x7.5' with a good-sized closet. It's not huge but I've =
been comfortable in it for the last year with a full sized bed and basic =
furniture. It will come un-furnished.
The rest of the apartment is pretty well furnished already, but we can ta=
lk about the stuff you own. It should feel like your apartment, too.=20
Quiet, tree-lined street with mostly young families.=20
Five minute walk to the subway (F/G) and Prospect Park goodness.=20

$1050/month for rent, wifi and fancy cable. We split gas and electricity.=
 Deposit is one month's rent. No fee, so it's $2100 to move in.=20
The lease goes until the end of April, when we'll have the option to rene=
w. I'm the leaseholder, so you'd sign a separate tenant agreement/subleas=
e with me.=20

About me:
30ish female with a full-time day job in the financial industry. I'm a th=
eater geek at heart and also have a small, scrappy theater company that k=
eeps me pretty busy when not working for The Man. I'm all for the occasio=
nal dinner party or split bottle of wine. Bookworm, cheesy movie enthusia=
st, NPR subscriber, baker of biscuits. Life in this city is insane and no=
body has enough time to relax, so it's important that home feels, well, h=
omey.=20

About you:
30ish female or male. Non-smoker, no pets. Steady, reliable income (I'm g=
oing to want to see stubs/references, etc.). Good-humored, drama-free gro=
wnup. Responsible with the bill paying, considerate with shared space.=20=


Interested? Think we might be a good fit? Send me an email and tell me a =
little about yourself.=20
What's your schedule like?=20
What are you looking for in a home?
Tell me about your relationship to dirty dishes.

Thanks all. I'll look forward to hearing from you.

1b, Heart of Williamburg, In Unit Laundry!
Available: Oct 01, 2014

I'm so thrilled to be moving into this gorgeous apartment October 1st and=
 am looking for someone lovely to take the other room!  The building is o=
n S4 and Keap Street right on the edge of the hub of Williamsburg, aka no=
t too crazy but tons of restaurants/bars/shops nearby.  4th floor walk up=
 to a completely new 2 bedroom/1 bath unit in a cool 1915 building with b=
eautiful finishings and lots of charm (crown moldings, mosaic tile bathro=
om, recessed lighting, wine rack in the fridge).  The living room will be=
 fully furnished (I've included some pics of my furniture in my current p=
lace so you get a sense of the vibe) and the empty bedroom will be unfurn=
ished and can fit a king size bed and has a huge closet.  I paid the brok=
ers fee and will not be charging you that!  Move in is first month and a =
month of security (so $3200) and the price does not include utilities (ga=
s, electric and cable/internet are extra).  Looking for at least a 6 mont=
h commitment.

About me: 29yf who works at Bam in Fort Greene (bam.org - check us out, w=
e're awesome and I get free tickets to everything!).  Certified yoga teac=
her who loves all things theater, dance, music, art etc.  Learning to pla=
y guitar.  420 friendly.  Originally from Boulder, Colorado but couldn't =
be more in love with New York - I love to spend my free time exploring an=
d experiencing the city so I like my home to be a peaceful sanctuary to g=
et away from all of the craziness.  And I don't cook (except for pancakes=
, which I will make for you on the weekends). =20

About you: late 20s or early 30s, professional who doesn't work from home=
, very clean and doesn't have people over all the time (it's New York Cit=
y - go out!).  Would consider a couple with a renegotiation of the price.=
  Mellow, drama free, ideally loves the arts and is cool hanging together=
 having a glass of scotch after a long day or doing our own things.

The pictures are of the actual unit - I know they're weird realtor pics b=
ut they're better than the ones I took on my iPhone...  I saw it with my =
own eyes and truly fell in love.  After a very long search I know this is=
 the best place, location, amenities for the money.  If you're interested=
, hit me up!

Available: Oct 01, 2014 through Aug 31, 2015

Bedroom and office in huge beautiful two-story brownstone. Big kitchen an=
d back terrace! Entire first floor is shared space.

Were looking for a third roommate for an October 1 move-in! Our beautiful=
 apartment occupies the second and third floors of a three-story brownsto=
ne in Prospect Heights, just a few blocks from Atlantic Terminal/Barclays=
 Center, and six blocks to Prospect Park. Super high ceilings, spacious c=
ommon rooms, and lots of light plus a back terrace off the giant eat-in k=
itchen make this apartment feel like a house. Its a rare find. The whole =
place has hardwood floors and nice details like ceiling moldings and pict=
ure rails. Plus, theres bike storage under the staircase!

The neighborhood is cool and safe. Were closely located to almost all maj=
or subways and the Long Island Rail Road. We're 20 minutes door-to-door t=
o Union Square, 20 minutes on the G to Williamsburg (or a 15 minute bike =
ride) and 30 minutes to Grand Central and Times Square. A laundromat is a=
round the corner and has a drop off service.

The living room, library/lounge area, kitchen, and back terrace are all o=
n the first floor of the apartment. The bedrooms, office, and bathroom (w=
hich has a claw foot tub and a tiled floor!) are all located upstairs.

The smallest bedroom and the office would be yours. The bedroom (50 squar=
e feet) is a cozy space. It fits a full-size bed and has a built-in close=
t. AND, not to fret, the office  (95 square feet) has plenty of space for=
 a desk, armoire, bookshelf, and comfy chair. It also has a built-in clos=
et. There is currently a large mirrored armoire in the office that I am c=
onsidering selling.

Your roommates would be an early-30s PhD student (guy), and a late-20s no=
n-profit data nerd (woman). Both are responsible, clean, quiet, and fun, =
love to cook. Looking for the same. First, last, and security are due upo=
n move-in. The monthly rent is $1260. We'd consider a couple at $1400.

$1,350.00 Per Month, Gowanus, Brooklyn, 200 sq. ft., 1+ bedroom and priva=
te bath in Gowanus
Available: Oct 01, 2014

1+ bedroom and private bath in Gowanus

I am looking for one person to share my 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom duplex in t=
he Gowanus/Boerum Hill area of Brooklyn. 2 apartments in the building, th=
is is the first two floors and the basement.

The room(s): the bedroom is about 10' x 14', with the intrusion of a larg=
e closet, about 125 square feet. Definitely big enough for a full or quee=
n-sized bed, dresser, bookcase, etc. The room has two windows and a ceili=
ng fan. It's quiet, and not particularly sunny. Just outside the room is =
a second room, more or less like a dressing room. It's about 80 square fe=
et, with a vanity and a sink. It's certainly big enough for an office - r=
ight now it is where the sewing machine and various other crafty things l=
ive.

The bathroom: you will have the downstairs bathroom to yourself, it's not=
 big, but it has all the basics, including a full-sized tub.=20

The apartment: the first floor is a large, sunny open space combining kit=
chen/dining area and living room, with one full bath (yours!), the bedroo=
ms and the second full bath (mine!) are on the second floor. I am moving =
my jewelry studio into the third bedroom, so there will just be two of us=
 here. The bedrooms are separated by a hallway, so there is quite a bit o=
f privacy. Spiral staircase (straight side stairs available, very helpful=
 for moving in), wood floors, relatively well-stocked kitchen with dishwa=
sher. *Washer and dryer* in the private basement (damp and slightly terri=
fying basement, but limited storage is available). Overall, it feels more=
 like living in a house than an apartment. You would need to bring only y=
our bedroom furniture, as shared spaces are pretty much furnished, but if=
 you have stuff, we can try to figure out where to fit it in.=20

Sorry, no pets, no smoking! =20

Utilities, basic cable, and wireless internet are shared, averaging about=
 $100 a month.

The neighborhood: pretty diverse, on the border between residential and i=
ndustrial, close to the Gowanus canal, but 2 blocks from Smith St. with g=
reat restaurants and shops. The closest subway stop is the Bergen St. sto=
p on the F/G line (~7 minute walk), the A/C and R lines are a 10 minute w=
alk. If you have a car, parking is pretty easy around here. There's a sup=
ermarket across the street that will do in a pinch, but I don't do much s=
hopping there. Trader Joe's is about a 15 minute walk in one direction, t=
he new Whole Foods is a 15 minute walk in the other. There's lots of grea=
t stuff happening in Gowanus; over the past few years there have been som=
e great new additions like Royal Palms and Lavender Lake (and the new Amp=
le Hills, my favorite).=20

Me: I'm a female in my 40's with a day job in non-profit. Occasional circ=
us performer, metalsmith, and flameworker. I'm not home much. I like the =
idea of cooking, but don't have time to do it much. I am conscientious ab=
out keeping the common spaces clean, and am respectful of other people's =
stuff. I'm pretty compulsive about recycling, and I try to bring my food =
scraps to the greenmarket on weekends for composting. I'm pretty busy, an=
d prefer a roommate who is the same - no couch potatoes, please!

Available October 1st. The room is $1350/month, utilities are additional.=
 I would require first months rent and a security deposit.

Please send an email telling me a little about yourself and to set up a t=
ime to see the apartment. At least a 6 month commitment preferred.

Thanks!=20

$1,050.00 Per Month, East Williamsburg / Bushwick, Brooklyn, 100 sq. ft.,=
 Room in Historic Cabin with Yard 3 blocks from L train
Available: Oct 01, 2014

This sweet 2 bedroom cabin offers a retreat in East Williamsburg/Bushwick=
 only 3 blocks from the Montrose L train, on a tree-lined, neighborhood-y=
 block close to great cafes and restaurants. The cabin includes a small p=
rivate yard and a private hall. Your room can comfortably fit a full size=
d bed and dresser. The pictures show it furnished. Your room can be furni=
shed or unfurnished. There is a freestanding closet built in along the fa=
r wall. There is also some storage space in the private hall to the cabin=
. There is one window in the room. The living room is an awesome place to=
 hang out and gets more light than the bedroom. Because this is a freesta=
nding building we have to pay heat, electric &amp; internet. You will pay=
 $150 in utilities. Minimum stay is a 3 month sublet from October-Decembe=
r, with big possibility for longer.

You will be sharing the cabin with a 31 year old writer &amp; photographe=
r trans-dyke who also has an art studio in the basement of the building t=
he cabin faces. A terrier / maltese dog also lives here, who is very calm=
 and affectionate. I have dust allergies and keep the apartment pretty cl=
ean. The cabin itself is a small unique space but combined with my art st=
udio and the yard it feels like another world, outside of brooklyn. The l=
iving room will likely see some redecoration and features vintage furnitu=
re, a grandma's turquoise couch, and very amazing books in experimental p=
oetry, photography, and queer culture. The kitchen is fully equipped.  Th=
e bathroom has a small tub and shower, and nice hot water pressure.  Outs=
ide is a furnished porch, with bench, table, and grill faces the viney, l=
eafy back of a three-story apartment building, with yards on both sides.=20=


This is not a party house. I just have a friend or two over from time to =
time. Because this home is my workspace, I like to it to be quiet and cal=
m here. Please tell me about yourself in your response.

$1,350.00 Per Month, Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, 2000 sq. ft., Enormous=
 Bedroom with Backyard &amp; Private Bath
Available: Oct 01, 2014

We're looking for a house mate to enjoy the ground floor master bedroom i=
n our 3 bedroom brownstone duplex starting October 1. The room is $1350 p=
er month, which includes ALL utilities (wifi, electric, heat+ water). Fir=
st month's rent + one month security will make the space yours. No lease =
sign required but the ideal person will be looking to stay for a while.=20=


The room is absolutely huge and features:
-Space! 18ft 4in. long x 12ft wide x 8ft high
-Private bathroom w/ full-size shower
-2 large double door closets for your singular use (one in room, one in t=
he hallway).=20
-Large windows (with south-facing light excellent for plants!)=20
-Hardwood floors throughout apt.
*Room can be painted white before move-in or you may re-paint the color o=
f your choice=20

We have a full size washer and dryer in the basement for shared use. Thro=
ugh our studio we have ground floor access to our private backyard comple=
te with fire pit. We also love to cook and share our creations - we would=
 love to live with someone who is into cuisine and creating a shared meal=
 here and there (though not a necessity.)

We're two early 30's professional ladies with art practices at home (we c=
onverted a bedroom into our shared studio space). We're non-smokers, pet =
free and we keep a tidy nest. We're looking for the same in a house mate.=
 Not looking for couples or significant-others-in-residence, please. This=
 is a real home and we're looking for a considerate, mature person to joi=
n and add to the environment. We do like to host get-togethers but only w=
ith the okay of all housemates. We clean our messes and dishes after we d=
ine bc we're grown and it is the golden rule. Basically we've been throug=
h the gamut of living w folk as well as on our own and we know what we ne=
ed in a balanced and happy home.=20
We're looking to live with an individual who has full time work outside o=
f the house and can demonstrate ability to supply rent on the first of ev=
ery month. We welcome creative folks looking to set-up a home studio or w=
ork area for clean and quiet projects - all that inspiring natural light =
and space would be really ideal for an artist.

The neighborhood is historic, friendly and full of Brooklyn charm. One of=
 us has lived in the building for almost 8 years. There are wonderful res=
taurants and bars a short walk away as well as the best grocery store for=
 miles right down the street. Kingston-Throop C train stop is convenientl=
y just around the corner / 10 minute walk to the A express / 25 minutes t=
o dtwn Manhattan / 35 min. direct to JFK.

We'd love to hear from you if you're interesting, thoughtful, responsible=
, creative, traveled, easy going and psyched to find a big warm creative =
space to thrive in!

$1,100.00 Per Month, Crown Heights, Brooklyn, 1100 sq. ft., Private Room =
w/Private Bathroom
Available: Sept 06, 2014

Roommate wanted to share a beautiful 2 bedroom/2 bathroom apartment in no=
rth Crown Heights. Available immediately. Rent will be pro-rated accordin=
g to move-in date.=20

Apartment: Big, open layout. Lots of windows. Full kitchen with separate =
dining area. Large living room. Very nice sized terrace (currently being =
renovated). Kitchen has everything it needs, and the living room is fully=
 furnished. You don't need to bring anything but things for your own room=
. Building is filled with mostly friendly neighbors- families who have li=
ved here for a long time and young professionals moving in.
Laundry in basement.

Room: Good sized (unfurnished) room with corner windows that face the bac=
k of the building. Past roommates have fit a full sized bed, desk and dre=
sser with no problem. Private bathroom located off the room with access o=
nly for you through your bedroom. It has a toilet, sink and a shower. Roo=
m has its own closet with a place to hang things as well as shelves above=
. There is also a coat/boot closet in the living room to share. Separate =
space to store your A/C unit in the winter.

Me: Friendly, quiet, respectful, and fun female. I am a professional who =
keeps fairly consistent hours: work 8-4ish in Manhattan. I'm also an amat=
eur aerialist who spends time on the weeknights and weekends rehearsing, =
etc. I have two small dogs who are super friendly, attention-lovers. I sp=
end a lot of time with them at the park down the block in the mornings an=
d evenings. I'm very independent and busy most of the time. I don't have =
a lot of people over or entertain frequently. I cook at home most nights,=
 but it's mostly simple meals- in and out of the kitchen quickly. I'm a l=
ong-time Brooklyn resident (almost 17 years). I love going to the beach f=
or the day, college football, watching documentaries on Netflix, and bein=
g upside down.

What I'm looking for:
Roommate (male or female, no couples!), non-smoker, who works consistent =
hours (preferably not at home) and has a steady income. Someone who loves=
 dogs- not just in the &quot;oh, dogs are cool&quot; kind of way... more =
along the &quot;hell, yeah, I love puppy kisses!!!&quot; kind of way. You=
 may also have a dog of your own if the situation works: our dogs get alo=
ng and we have similar styles of care for our pets (ie: you don't leave y=
ours in a cage from morning until night). I'd like someone that I can hav=
e conversations with, but we don't necessarily have to be best buds. Some=
one who is independent and looking for a quiet place to come home to at t=
he end of the day is key. I'm not looking to share my home with someone w=
ho is going to bring home random people, frequently wants out of town gue=
sts to stay with them, or likes to entertain a lot. This apartment is ver=
y much my &quot;home&quot;, and the space is best suited for someone who =
wants and appreciates the same.=20

Shared expenses: electric, gas and internet split 50/50. Cable is negotia=
ble. I can take it or leave it. Currently have it but the bill is huge be=
cause Cablevision won't give me a good package anymore because I've been =
a customer too long (crazy!). So, if we decide to have cable, it would ha=
ve to be in your name. They are more likely to give a good deal to a new =
customer.

Neighborhood: &quot;Historic&quot; North Crown Heights... whatever that m=
eans! It's mostly residential. I've lived here going on 5 years, and the =
neighborhood keeps getting better and better. Small park (Brower Park) do=
wn the block with off-leash hours for dogs and a great community of dog o=
wners. A few blocks north of Eastern Parkway.=20
Nostrand Ave is one block away and has new restaurants and coffee shops p=
opping up all the time. Franklin Ave is a 10 minute walk. Prospect Park i=
s 20 min.
Trains: A/C @ Nostrand, 3 @ Nostrand, 2/5 @ President
Buses: B44 express to Williamsburg just a couple blocks away

Photos: some of the decor has changed and the photos of the actual bedroo=
m don't do it justice! Best seen in person.

$950.00 Per Month, South Park Slope, Brooklyn, 100 sq. ft., Sweet room in=
 Park Slope Brooklyn
Available: Oct 01, 2014 through Mar 31, 2015

One bedroom available in beautiful 3 bedroom apartment in Park Slope!
14th St and 4th Ave. Close to F/G/R.
Move-in: October 1.
*The bedroom may be available before October 1, please let me know what y=
our needs are.*

Length of sublet: The lease on the apartment runs through August 2015. Id=
eally I'd like someone who can commit through March, and then it will wor=
k out for them to stay through August. But I am open to different time fr=
ames, with a minimum of 3 months, so please let me know what your needs a=
re.

* $950/mo covers rent AND utilities
1 month rent plus 1 month security deposit $1900 required upon move-in. T=
his is a steal for a great neighborhood and a lovely shared space!

Females only, sorry dudes! No pets, please. And sorry, no couples!=20

The room fits a full bed &amp; desk/dresser nicely, but it is on the smal=
l side. If you have a lot of stuff this is probably not the best situatio=
n for you! The room has a window and a closet.

You'll be joining two females in their early thirties who have style &amp=
; grace &amp; fun, full lives, but keep the common areas clean and neat a=
nd are very respectful of each other when we are all at home. We are both=
 vegetarian though it's not a strict policy about the apt.

The living room and kitchen are furnished. Juicer, blender, yoga mats, to=
aster, sewing machine all available for your use. The apartment has a lar=
ge central living room, a kitchen, bathroom and 3 bedrooms. All three bed=
rooms have windows and closets as well as high storage areas. The apartme=
nt has nice old wood floors and high ceilings, but the kitchen is not mod=
ernized (no dishwasher!) and the bathroom is pretty small. But other than=
 that I think it has a spacious feel and an intangible good vibe!

The closest subway is the F/G/R at 4th Ave &amp; 9st in Park Slope. It's =
a nice, safe area, 4 avenues east of beautiful Prospect Park. Both 5th Av=
e &amp; 7th Ave are filled with bars restaurants and shopping. It's also =
close to Carroll Gardens/ Smith Street in Brooklyn which is a nice shoppi=
ng/ eating area. Laundromat is across the street &amp; there are grocery =
stores, yoga, gym, great coffeeshops, and anything you need nearby. High =
speed internet but no cable or tv.

When you reply, please tell me about yourself, including your current liv=
ing situation and why are you looking for a sublet, your schedule, and an=
ything else you'd like to share!

Feel free to ask questions. One thing is that we don't have good indoor b=
ike storage so unless you keep your bike in your room, it's kind of a bum=
mer.

Best,
Amanda=20

$1,300.00 Per Month, Park Slope, Brooklyn, Beautiful apartment with huge =
backyard
Available: Sept 15, 2014 through Aug 31, 2015


I am looking for a female roommate for a beautiful 2 bedroom apartment in=
 Park Slope, Brooklyn, NY.  The apartment is on the ground floor and has =
private access to a huge backyard (it's truly special to have that much o=
utdoor space in NY).=20

$650.00 Per Month, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, Seeking a fourth housema=
te for our home in Bed Stuy for October 1st.
Available: Oct 01, 2014

We live in a quiet corner of Bed-Stuy, on a block of kind neighbors and m=
ulti-generational families. The A/C and J/Z trains are about 12-min walk =
away, with bus-lines and bike paths even closer.

Our apartment takes up the top two floors of a brownstone that, in additi=
on to 4 bedrooms, features an open kitchen and dining room; a living room=
 so big we've carved out areas for work/study, entertaining, and TV-viewi=
ng; two bathrooms; and, a meditation/yoga room. There is also a washer/dr=
yer in the downstairs bedroom that is for everyone to use.

The available bedroom is the smallest and coziest in the house -- about 1=
0 x 12 ft, fitting possibly a desk, shelves, and full-size bed (a queen m=
ay be tight). There is a closet in the bedroom and a second closet availa=
ble off of the living room. The room is on the 2nd floor, with a small wi=
ndow facing the tree-lined street.=20

Rent for the room is $650/month. As a house we share the cost of utilitie=
s, internet, house supplies (toilet paper, paper towels, etc), and some f=
ood.

Were seeking someone who is an open communicator, independent, mature, re=
sponsible, etc. -- and, importantly, someone who wants to help build a ho=
me. We're all dedicated to healthy lifestyles and lead busy lives that of=
ten take us out of the house, but we look forward to seeing each other an=
d checking in. Our new housemate should be willing to sign a lease, which=
 were renewing. For our landlord, you will need to provide proof of emplo=
yment and a housing reference. Please note that were not looking for more=
 pets.=20

We are all women in or nearing our 30s. More about us ...

and enjoys exploring the city with camera in tow. She's a black woman and=
 originally from Boston.=20

s a New Yorker since she has lived in the city for more than a decade. Sh=

e summer, and philosophizing about everything and nothing with friends an=
d roommates over a shared meal or a glass of wine.

Deborah is the newest to Brooklyn/NY, as she recently moved from Seattle =
(and lived in Chicago before that). She currently works from home for a c=

thing and we would appreciate it if you also were aligned with those inte=
ntions.

We keep a clean house filled with good energy and understanding. Our land=
lord lives below with his family and a couple lives above. That's it. Ver=
y cozy.

$1,150.00, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 1 Private BR Sublet in Spacious N Will=
iamsburg Apt - Same block as Bedford L train
Available: Sept 20, 2014 through Oct 09, 2014

This listing is for one private room in a 2 bedroom, 1 bath, spacious, an=
d new apartment located in the heart of the vibrant artistic community of=
 Williamsburg, Brooklyn. We're located on the same block as the Bedford L=
 stop so it's extremely convenient for getting around -- you can get to U=
nion Square in 5 minutes and we're only 1 stop away from Manhattan. My ro=
om will be available from 9/20 - 10/9, and you will be sharing the apartm=
ent with my roommate who goes out of town frequently. I'm asking for $1,1=
50 for the entire period, and a $350 security deposit that I will return =
to you as long as there are no issues. Also, there's a chance that I will=
 have to crash on the couch in the living room for 1 night on 9/30 before=
 my flight to CA the next day.

The room contains a double bed and can accommodate two people. The place =
is bright and clean and in a great area -- close enough to Bedford, Metro=
politan, or Grand to enjoy all of the amazing bars, cafes, and restaurant=
s, but just a touch off of the main drag to provide a semblance of peace.=
 Williamsburg has some of the best restaurants in Brooklyn and even in al=
l of NYC. Also, if you like movies and/or independent cinema, there are s=
ome great movie theaters within walking distance of our apartment. We are=
 also 5 blocks from the waterfront, where you can experience some of the =
best views of the Manhattan skyline and also the Brooklyn Flea market and=
 Smorgasburg food festival on the weekends.

Fresh linens and towels are provided, there is high speed internet and ca=
ble, central AC, and my roommate loves to cook and has everything you wou=
ld ever need in the kitchen, which you are free to use. Free coffee and t=
ea are available upon request. In addition, either my roommate or I would=
 be more than happy to provide information about the area or Manhattan or=
 help out in whatever way we can.

There is a basement which can be used for storage, which is really nice i=
f you have a bike or sporting equipment and don't feel like bringing it u=
pstairs. There's also ample desk and table space in case you want to hook=
 up a laptop and work for a while. Last but not least, our apartment buil=
ding has a rooftop!

If you need any recommendations, you can ask us and we'll do our best to =
help you enjoy the city. We hope to see you soon!

Hi! We've got a bedroom opening up in our 3 bedroom apartment on Avenue C=

 Your room is standard size for New York. It's unfurnished, though it doe=
s already have an AC unit installed. It can fit a full size bed and a mod=
estly sized dresser or desk. The previous tenant had a high dresser with =
a TV on-top of it with a full bed and desk to the side. Some imagination =
may be required.

The closet subway would be the F at 1st Ave. There's a bus that runs down=
 Houston as well. If you don't like that bus there's another one on C and=
 8th street.

The two of us that already live in the apartment are grad students. We're=
 both pretty relaxed, courteous, respectful, the usual important things y=
ou'd want in roommates. We love music and are totally open to sharing mea=
ls together if you are into that kind of thing.

Long term would be preferred (lease ends August 31), but we could be amen=
able to shorter term in the right circumstances. We already have the apar=
tment, we just need you to sublet. Rent is 1,400/month plus utilities.

oom with private bathroom steps away from Prospect Park
Available: Sept 17, 2014 through Oct 15, 2014

eeks. The room has its own bathroom, several windows, and the entire apar=
tment has hardwood floors. Great kitchen and large common area too.=20

The apartment is around the corner from Prospect Park and the Q train (ab=
out 20 minutes from the house to Union Square). The B is also nearby, and=
 there are several regular buses to various areas of Brooklyn.=20

I have one roommate who is not home much. The room is comfortable but spa=
rsely furnished as I moved in recently - there is a bed, a set of drawers=
, floor lamp, and plenty of closet space. I am knocking the rent down sli=
ghtly because of this. The rest of the apartment is fully furnished.=20

I am looking for someone who will be respectful of the space and leave it=
 as they found it. No couples, no pets please.=20

$750.00, Prospect Park South/Flatbush, Brooklyn, 500 sq. ft., Sunny One B=
edroom Apartment Sublet 9/24-10/5
Available: Sept 24, 2014 through Oct 05, 2014

Hello,

I'm looking to sublet my sunny one bedroom apartment in Flatbush/Prospect=
 Park South from 9/24-10/5. There may be some flexibility with dates - ju=
st ask.

The apartment is charming and spacious and on the top floor of a quiet bu=
ilding (with an elevator!). It's very sunny, with windows in every room (=
including the bathroom). The apartment is located about a ten minute walk=
 from the Southeastern-most corner of Prospect Park, so it's great if you=
 are a jogger or just want to laze about in the sunshine.

The neighborhood itself is bustling, with lots of small fruit and veggies=
 stands and Caribbean restaurants.

About 15-20 minutes to Cortelyou, which features a handful of charming ba=
rs and restaurants to enjoy.

It's fully furnished, and there are nice art books to peruse and plants t=
o keep you company! There is also wifi.=20

AC in the bedroom, though I hope you won't need it by then.

The B and the Q trains at Church Ave are the closest subways. They run ex=
press into Manhattan, so it's possible to get to downtown/Chinatown area =
in about 20-30 minutes, and to Union Square in about 35 minutes. The B do=
es not run on weekends, be forewarned!

The 2 and the 5 trains are also within walking distance, and there are pl=
enty of buses and cabs along Flatbush Avenue.

No smoking, no pets.=20

$750 + $500 refundable deposit

 Sunny One-Bedroom, Prime East Village Location, Furnished, Available Oct=
ober 1 ~ 1 year lease
Available: Oct 01, 2014 through Oct 01, 2015

Ideal for a couple or an individual: great kitchen for cooking, tons of s=
torage, and situated on one of the prettiest, quietest streets in the Eas=
t Village. I'm going to Italy for year on a Fulbright fellowship, otherwi=
se I'd never give this place up!

Situated in a 1920s building on East 7th Street at Second Avenue, this re=
cently renovated 1 bedroom/1 bath comes fully furnished. The apartment fe=
atures hardwood floors, new kitchen and bath, and tons of built-in storag=
e. Linens, bedding, appliances and cookware are all provided so just brin=
g your suitcase.

I've lived in this apartment for nearly 5 years now and have sublet it fo=
r 6 months in 2012 while I was in Japan. It's been a great base for livin=
g in NYC, I've been working as a designer at the Metropolitan Museum of A=
rt, and because of the proximity to the subway, I can get to the museum i=
n under 30 minutes. I can also attest to the neighbors being quiet and re=
spectful. In the interest of full disclosure: there isn't a building supe=
rintendent, and the landlord can be very difficult to reach. This situati=
on has been OK for me, but it's important to have a key stashed with a fr=
iend in case you get locked out. There is a very nice Ukranian handyman w=
ho lives in Brooklyn and does renovations on the building and can let you=
 in with his keys (or fix things) for a fee.

- Flooded with sunlight from two big southern-exposure windows
- Windows in every room, including bathroom and bedroom
- Air Conditioner window unit, reliable heating in winter
- Kitchen that's great for those who love to cook: gas stove, oven, full-=
size fridge with freezer, and microwave/toaster are supplied
- Super shower: impressive water pressure and unlimited amounts of hot wa=
ter (for those of you who love long relaxing showers)

Available: Sept 15, 2014 through Oct 15, 2014

I'm on the 3rd floor of a remodeled building that dates to 1897.

If you're a design aficionado and appreciate technology, you'll love this=
 spacious, incredibly quiet apartment. To repaint it, I studied 3 Technic=
olor films from the 40s and 50s and painted each room with very saturated=
 colors. Then I installed a new floor and had my best pieces of furniture=
 recovered. Finally, I installed a Hue lighting system that can be contro=
lled by your iPhone or a remote. You can read about the apartment and see=
 photos of it in the European design magazine &quot;Apartamento.&quot;

Amenities:

living room
large kitchen
large dining room area
2 bedrooms
laundry alcove
blue-tiled bathroom
new floor

dishwasher
washing machine
dryer
Fios TV and Internet

I'm hoping to get out of New York for 2 to 3 months, and my dates are fle=
xible, as long as they don't start too late in the fall.

$1,750.00 Per Month, brooklyn, brooklyn, Boy and his dog seeking a sublet=
 situation
Available: Oct 01, 2014 through Feb 01, 2015

I am a 32 year old filmmaker with a perfectly trained awesome 7 year old =
dog.  I've been living in new york for 10 years.  I was in manhattan for =
9 1/2 of those years and am currently giving Brooklyn a try but trying to=
 avoid a year long commitment.  I have been subletting in Brooklyn for a =
few months now and would love to continue the experiment through the wint=
er at least in a new place!  So ideally, I'd be looking for a place for 3=
-6 months with flexibility on both ends of that spectrum.

About me:  I keep myself on a fairly strict 9-5 (really 8-6) schedule wor=
king in midtown manhattan.  I'm currently deep in post production on a fi=
lm which had me traveling like crazy over the last year.   So my life and=
 schedule is oddly predictable through at least the end of the year.  I h=
ave lived with and without roommates and never have had an issue.  I'm cl=
ean and courteous and understand the new york living situation game.  I'm=
 open to a roommate situation but would ideally prefer an entire place.  =
But again, either works for me at this point.

My dog is awesome.  I think he's a beagle/doberman (he's a rescue) and he=
's literally the easiest dog I've ever been around.  I take full care of =
him and you'd never have to worry about him or even know he was there.  I=
f you were there, he would just want to cuddle you and make you pretty ha=
ppy all the time.  He's great.  Really.

Other than that I'm pretty simple.  I have very little &quot;stuff&quot;,=
 which was an intentional choice to live a very minimalistic lifestyle.  =
So moving in and out for me is incredibly easy.  I go out a fair amount b=
ut also spend a lot of my downtime at home watching movies or writing or =
relaxing.  I do also cook on occasion but during the week my lunch at the=
 office is my main meal and dinner is quick and light and usually not coo=
ked at home.

Any other questions or conversations you'd like to have with me feel free=
 to ask and I can provide social network links or anything else you'd lik=
e to see.  I'm available to come check places out most times that will wo=
rk for you as I am my own boss in a way.

If you think our situations might align, don't hesitate to contact me!

Good luck in your search.

Hi,

I am a 25 yo F working in Finance. I have been living in NYC for more tha=
n two years and a half.

I have moved so many times and had so many roommates (most of them intern=
s) that I am now really eager to find a nice place to settle and roommate=
s that I can have share dinner with from time to time, have a nice chat o=
r watch tv. I am very social and I have my friends but having roommates y=
ou actually get along with really makes a difference.
My Ideal room/apt would be large enough to fit a queen size bed, a dresse=
r and has its closet and last but not least is full of light!
I am looking exclusively in Brooklyn somewhere near Bedford/Lorimer or Na=
ssau station and I would like to move sometime early October.
More about me:
I am passionate about music, cinema (foreign movies and independant movie=
s) and reading. I play the luth and I may appear at first like a nerdy in=
tellectual person but no worries even though it is partly true I also lov=
e going out and dancing.

Before coming to NY I lived in Paris and London.

If you feel I can be a good fit, send me an email, I am usually quick to =
respond.

Looking forward to hearing from you!=20

er and or parks also preferable.  More about me, i am a Kansas transplant=
 and have been in New York for about a year.  I'm not home a lot and am p=
retty quiet, no parties, loud music, drugs etc.  I have great credit, hav=
e a decent income and additional revenue from a home i own and lease out =
in Kansas.

$1,200.00 Per Month, Any -, Brooklyn, Queens, Easy to get along with - Se=
eking apt by Oct 1
Available: Sept 26, 2014

I have been in my great building in South Williamburg for 4 years. I am l=
ooking to switch things up and find a new place to call home. My lease en=
ds 10/1. Location is not as important as having a relaxing environment an=
d friendly roommates who all co-exist in harmony. I like surrounding myse=
lf with people who take care of themselves and are generally good, honest=
, and communicative people. Outdoor space or rooftop access is a plus but=
 as long as the apt gets good light, those are just bonuses.

Looking for someone who has a room or for someone to co-sign a lease with=
. I am fine with going month to month or full year for the right place. H=
oping to spend under $1,000 but can go up to $1,200. If the place is amaz=
ing and is beyond perfect I can go above that number. Open to neighborhoo=
ds with reasonable commuting time to Lower Manhattan. Bushwick, Crown Hei=
ghts, Bed Stuy, Prospect Heights, Park/South Slope, Lefferts Garden, Suns=
et Park, Greenpoint in BK and Long Island City and Astoria in Queens. Ope=
n to other neighborhoods not listed, these are just examples of where I t=
hink I can find good mix of space/price.

You can take a look at my website for some background info and links to F=
B and LinkedIn. www.preetgujral.com . The short of it is that I work for =
a  data consulting services start up that is growing rapidly. I love my j=
ob and am putting my heart and soul into it's success and it occupies mos=
t of my time. My income is stable and I have excellent credit. I work fro=
m the office 90% of the time with the occasional remote day.
=20
I consider the apartment a sanctuary and like to keep it pretty neat and =
clean, without being obsessive about it. I sometimes like having a handfu=
l of friends over for dinner but not that often and I don't party at home=
. Barely drink, but I do enjoy a social cocktail or delicious craft beer.=
 I like sharing meals with roommates but respect desires for independent =
living/privacy. I am fine with being in a social environment as long as e=
veryone is respectful of each other's sleep/quiet time needs - open commu=
nication!
=20
In my free time I lead an active lifestyle - biking, hiking, camping, tra=
veling, prospect park,  or just catching up on errands, TV, and working o=
n personal projects. I have been to burning man several times and love th=
e culture and I occasionally like going out to burner events around the c=
ity. I also love participatory, visual, and performance arts and like to =
get involved with organizations such as FigmentNYC.=20
=20
I have an indoor American short hair tabby cat. I have had him since he w=
as 9 weeks old and he is now 9 years old. He is very friendly both to hum=
ans and other animals. He just wants to chill and get belly rubs :) I get=
 him groomed and brush him myself to minimize shedding. It is important t=
hat roommates understand basics of living with a cat - keeping doors clos=
ed and not leaving food out where he can get into trouble, etc, but he is=
 very low maintenance. I would be happy if you or other roommates have pe=
ts too.=20

If this sounds interesting, let me know. Hoping to wrap up an apartment q=
uickly. I have common area apartment furnishings, but I am not attached a=
nd am willing to part ways with most of it based on the existing set up.

*** Rent ranging from $1,000 - $1,350 (I can be flexible and pay up to $1=
,400)

-A safe neighborhood with great Subway access
-A clean, non-rat infested building
-Up to date appliances or well kept appliances
-Great sunlight
-A 1 Year Lease
-Rent controlled property would be great but not a necessity=20

our open property. I look forward to moving into a wonderful new space th=
at I can call my own!=20

Dear Prospective Landlord,

I hope this message finds you well.

My name is Sanae,=20

I'm a 32 year old single woman in search of a new home. I would love to b=
ecome your new favorite tenant!

I've lived in my neighborhood for years and it's been nearly 4 months now=
 that I've been searching for my new home. Ideally, I need to move anytim=
e before mid-October but can wait for the right space.

I work as a creative, I can do just about anything with regards to aesthe=
tic and design. This means if your space needs a little fixing up, I woul=
d be more than happy to give it some love, its what I do best!

As a tenant I am very quiet and respectful of my space, neighbors, and co=
mmunity. I always pay my bills on time and truly make my space my home an=
d sanctuary. I work a lot and I do not smoke nor have any pets. My presen=
t landlord would be more than happy to give me a really great reference.

I know I'm looking for quite the needle or gem if you will in a haystack =
and I'm really trying to stay in my neighborhood (Fort Greene / Clinton H=
ill) but I'm open to going a little outwards south and west. Fortunately =
I have a lot flexibility with my move-in date, finding the right space is=
 most important to me.

I am looking for an unfurnished pre-war space for long term lease, I'm op=
en to lease take-overs as well.

I am open to two room / alcove studios but I really think I need a true o=
ne bedroom to accommodate my furniture, I'm aware this will be a difficul=
t find.=20

I am not looking for a share situation but a place of my own.=20

Thanks for taking the time to read this.=20

Warmest Regards-
Your Future Tenant

$1,000.00 Per Month, Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, New York, Looking for l=
ong-term sublet or furnished room / apartment
Available: Nov 01, 2014

Hello, I am a 38 year old male from Europe, employed at New York's New Mu=
seum as a Digital Art Conservator.

My current sublet is running out in November and I would like to take the=
 chance to move a bit closer to my workplace and experience another neigh=
borhood in the city.

I am tidy, responsible, reliable and financially stable, don't smoke and =
do not own any pets. In general my belongings are rather minimal, so I wo=
uld prefer a furnished place for rent or a sublet, for at least a few mon=
ths. My working schedule keeps me busy, every now and then also on the we=
ekend, but sometimes I also like to (quietly) work on some stuff at home.=


Probably you will find me pleasant to be around. I have many different in=
terests, worked in art, music and science, and wouldn't mind moving in wi=
th somebody nice, but am also content on my own.

Please message me and do not hesitate to ask questions.

Since I found my current place via Listings Project and am more than happ=
y with it, I hope it will work a second time. :)

$800.00 Per Month, Bed Stuy, Bushwick, Williamsburg, Greenpoint, Dumbo, C=

r your plants and walk your dog, etc
Available: Oct 01, 2014

I'd love to live somewhere beautiful, kind, not too far from a subway, su=
pportive of the creative arts, whether that means your an artist, or an a=
rts-lover. Basically what I'm looking for is a very lovely situation... M=
y budget is maybe enough to make this happen, but I'm happy to raise the =
bar a little by being a part of your home in an extra way, for example, d=
oing a little dog walking, or baby-sitting, or gardening. I love gardenin=
g, arranging flowers, baking and cooking, especially delicious things tha=
t are sugar-free, gluten-free, vegan, etc as well as things that also inc=
lude good meat, cheese, etc.

I'm a British woman who lived in Los Angeles for ten years before moving =
to NYC in April of this year. I've had a very happy sublet for 6 months i=
n the East Village, and now I'm ready to rock on over to Brooklyn to be a=
 part of all the good stuff that's going on in this fine olde island of a=
rtists, pirates, poets and bards.

As a musician, I'm best known for playing violin for the Smashing Pumpkin=
s. I've composed string arrangements for many wonderful bands and solo ar=
tists, which means if you hear some violins or an orchestra in the backgr=
ound on a song, the chances are that someone like me wrote the charts and=
 organized the recording session for the strings. So yes, I'm a musician,=
 but what this looks like at home is me writing charts. It's a quiet crea=
tive thing. And I also mentor other musicians, and work for a radio stati=
on / online music app thingy. Which is what brings me to Brooklyn...

As a writer, I write about food. My books have been published by HarperCo=
llins, Rizzoli etc, and my articles by the Los Angeles Times, etc.=20

Anyway, thanks for reading this post, and let me know if you have any que=
stions, or to tell me about your lovely room!
