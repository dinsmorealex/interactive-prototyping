Hello;

We have a study taking place next week on Monday April 7th, 2014 in 
Manhattan.

We are looking for males between the ages of 18 - 35 who own and play 
mobile games on an iOS device.

The compensation will be $85 paid via check after the completion of the 
study.

There are several time slots available for the focus group, select the 
one that works best for you.


If you are interested in applying:
•              Visit www.nyfocusgroups.com/projects

•              Click “apply” next to the group you are interested in. 
(Please make sure you apply to the group with the corresponding date)


The survey you will be filling out is just an eligibility survey and 
you will not be compensated for filling it out.

FAQ
Q: I've been applying for studies, but I haven't been picked. Why?

A: It could be a number of reasons. Perhaps the study is already full 
or you didn’t meet all of the criteria we were looking for. Don’t be 
discouraged! You won’t be accepted for every focus group. Keep trying 
and you should get an opportunity! It could also be that, the number you 
provided in you profile isn’t working, or you didn’t provide a number 
for us to reach you. Please take the time to update your profile, to 
ensure that you have provided a current phone number.


Thank you for your time and if you have any questions please feel free 
to contact me.
