So cool. Where have I been? Under a rock? I think I can say &quot;mazel-t=
ov!&quot; on executing these great ideas...i could have said: congrats, k=
udos, props and creds but I'm more of a mazel tov kinda guy, dad, writer,=
 Canadian and born again artist. Just signed up and will continue to disc=
over and explore your site. Keep it up and carry on. All the best, David

$1,250.00 Per Month, Clinton Hill/Navy Yard, Brooklyn, Plenty Of Spaces A=
vailable In Beautiful Newly Renovated Bldg! Huge Range Of Sizes/Prices Av=
ailable!
Available: Aug 01, 2014

To anyone looking for a great new studio space to work in, I have been as=
ked to refer you to a new art studio project. I've had my studio in the s=
ame building for many years now, and it truly is a wonderful place to wor=
k!=20

Because it's a brand new build out, there are many different spaces avail=
able. The prices begin at $1025-$1275 for the medium-large ones. All have=
 massive windows, and and are perfect size for sharing.

And then there are the truly enormous spaces with FAR more space and even=
 more windows. These range anywhere from $1400 - $4000.=20

Each space will have plenty of light and ventilation, as well as a heat a=
nd AC unit in every space. The building also provides gorgeous rooftop vi=
ews, 24 hour access and security, and an enormous loading dock and freigh=
t elevator.=20

For those not familiar with the area, it's generally thought of as a safe=
, quiet Brooklyn neighborhood. The building is just a few blocks from the=
 G train, with plenty of food options and easy street parking.

I have had my own art studio in this building for almost 4 years, and the=
 management has asked me to help get interest in the new spaces as they a=
re expanding the number of studios in the building. I will be the one sho=
wing the spaces and there are absolutely NO fees involved.

If you're interested, please text Jordan at 917-754-5603. I look forward =
to hearing from you. Thanks!

$395.00 Per Day, little italy, manhattan, unusual workspace studio-office=
 for healing practitioner
Available: Sept 24, 2014

I have a beautiful new studio/office I use for body-work, i.e. massage, e=
tc. that I would like to offer to another healing practitioner.=20
It's on Broome just below Bowery so it's convenient to the JM/ NRQ/ BD/ a=
nd 6 trains.=20
My space is up a flight of easy, wide stairs on a floor with 4 other arti=
sts.=20
The space has new walls, a new wood floor, a silver-leaf door, and a beau=
tiful skylight! It's serene.=20
The room is about 160sq. ft. so there's ample room for a small group (2-4=
), like for Pilates or Yoga.=20
I have a small seating area, yoga mats, a desk, file cabinet, an Ikea cre=
denza for sheets, and my bodywork table.=20
Otherwise, it has a bohemian atmosphere very different than a healing cen=
ter/office type one. It's so refreshing having a whole studio to yourself=
 for this kind of work. Outside my space it's not pristine, like I say, i=
t is an artists building, but it's cool. The bathroom isn't super fancy e=
ither, but it's quite new and very clean. My clients love the space and f=
ind it a comfortable setting for receiving bodywork. I don't play music, =
but you could if you want.=20
The neighborhood is hip and lively and there are a variety of cafes and e=
ateries close by.=20
The space would be ideal for Feldenkrais, Rolfing, Alexander technique, M=
assage, private yoga, Reflexology, etc.
$25/hourly=20
Monthly rate : $225 for 1/2 day, $395/for 1 full day. Rate decrease with =
more days

Hey all! I currently share a really large studio in a big warehouse space=
 in-between Williamsburg and Bedstuy, off the Myrtle G. I share the space=
 with 4 other film people but am looking to move into a studio with other=
 visual artist (ideally). we currently each pay 200-225 depending on the =
size of our work space. I just spoke with the the broker and there are a =
few other spaces in the space building (that I have found to be an ideal =
work space for me, I'm a sculptor and ceramic artist). I would love to fi=
nd a large space with other motivated and determined individuals in the s=
pace building ideally because I've found it to be an easy location to get=
 to from Bushwich, Williamsburg and Bedstuy and way cheaper than anything=
 else I've found in New York. Let me know if you're interested. Ideally I=
 would move into the space on October 15 or November 1. Shoot me an email=
 and your website if interested. Thanks!! I can send you photos of my cur=
rent space, which will most likely be the same layout as the new one. Let=
 me know if you're interested, trying to figure this out asap.=20

$600.00 Per Month, Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, 1000 sq. ft., Enormous Art/Pho=
to Studio with private bathroom and kitchenette to share
Available: Oct 01, 2014 through Oct 01, 2015

I am a photographer seeking 2+ people to share my 1,000sqft studio in Cli=
nton Hill, Brooklyn a couple blocks away from Steiner Studios and very cl=
ose to Post Office, restaurants and Pratt. Depending on your needs, we ca=
n figure out the best way to split the space. For photographers, we can m=
ake the entire studio a shared photo shoot space.

The studio has its own private bathroom and sink/refrigerator. Currently,=
 the photo setup takes up half (500 sq. ft.), but again this can be chang=
ed depending on your space needs. This is ideal if you need a working spa=
ce for your business or are an artist (or more than one) looking for a gr=
eat amount of space to work in. I am usually only there on weekends and s=
ome evenings, so if you are looking for a space to use 9-5, this would be=
 perfect for you.

I am asking $600 plus utilities (this doesn't usually exceed $30/month), =
and would prefer someone who is looking for something long term starting =
on or before October 1st. If you can bring other people in to share, the =
rent goes down for all of us (3 people =3D $600/month, 4 people =3D $450/=
month). You are not going to find a better deal per sq.ft. than this in a=
 populated area (trust me, I've looked).

A freight elevator is available for moving large equipment. The studio is=
 located 2 blocks from the post office, Utrecht, and numerous eateries.

$700.00 Per Month, Bushwick, Brooklyn, 300 sq. ft., Spacious, Light-fille=
d, with Inspiring view of Manhattan and Queens
Available: Oct 05, 2014 through Jun 30, 2015

Beautiful wall-of-windows studio with view and light. Located in a buildi=
ng of studios on 119 Grattan St, near the Morgan Ave L train. The buildin=
g is very secure, has a freight elevator, 24 hr access, slop sink right b=
y the studio in the hallway, heater and thermostat located in the studio.=


I will be using my studio very sparingly over the next 9 months or more a=
nd I am seeking someone who would like to share the space with me.  There=
 is also the possibility to stay on after 9 months, when I am back in the=
re more regularly, if we both decide that would work. The timeframe of th=
e share has some flexibility as to when it begins and ends, so if you hav=
e particular needs that don't fall exactly from now through June, we can =
probably work something out.=20

Most of my belongings will be stored behind a sliding wall, so they will =
be out of sight.  I will retain one corner of the studio with a work tabl=
e and some power tools stored underneath it and may come in occasionally =
to do some work, although it is unlikely.

Your portion would be 300sf of the 400:
Your portion of the rent is $700 plus utilities, which are typically very=
 low. You will have the place to yourself most of the time as I will be u=
sing it primarily as a storage only.=20
If we decide to share the space after 9 months, it will be divided evenly=
 and your rent and utilities will go down to reflect that.=20

If interested, please email me with info regarding what you do, the mater=
ials you use, and some basic info about yourself.=20

Thanks,
Danielle Webb

What is a Visionhub?

A Visionhub is a small group of independent creatives formed to clarify a=
nd enhance a common core vision. This unifying thread strengthens individ=
ual projects and accelerates the manifestation of a greater communal visi=
on, transcending cultural boundaries, disciplines, and beliefs in order t=
o contribute to a healthier and more enlightened world.

Our mission is to cultivate the growth and crosspollination of other Visi=
onhub groups, working with an open source model that strengthens physical=
 and virtual groups formed around the world. Visionhubs will be linked, y=
et each as truly unique as the creatives who form them.

What We Offer:

- Starting January 2015, PointB will transition from a live-work model to=
 a vision-work model.

- Currently, we are calling for interviews with creatives who want to con=
tribute=20
to the prototyping of this Visionhub by joining an in-house group of like=
-minded individuals and an international network of 1000+ creative profes=
sionals established over 18 years.

- We are offering individuals or collectives 6 spacious private studios/w=
orkspaces, available at 1 month, 6 month, and 1 year sublets

- Sublets in studio/workspaces are available at $2300-$2800 per month. Ev=
ent spaces are available at $200-$800 per day.=20

- The core of PointB VisionHub will be 'The Hub' a physical 3-level space=
 for talks, events, and workshops, and the location of the reference libr=
ary.

- In-house members will have the opportunity to organize, curate, and par=
ticipate in all monthly programming.

Who We Would Like to See In-House:

Our colleagues will be global, creative professionals and innovators whos=
e work strengthens the crossovers between art, science, and spirituality.=
 They are ready to manifest and share a core vision with a reach beyond t=
hemselves. They are building the future now.

Interview Process:

- Contact us with how you would utilize and participate in the PointB Vis=
ionhub. If we are intrigued and believe your mission aligns with ours we =
will set up a preliminary interview.=20

$1,200.00 Per Month, Gowanus, Brooklyn, 900 sq. ft., Oct 1st room for ren=
t in Gowanus
Available: Oct 01, 2014

Beginning October 1st, I'm renting out the other half of my 2br/1ba apart=
ment for $1,200 a month and a flexible 6 month to 1 year lease. I am look=
ing for a single tenant only because the space can't accommodate couples =
or pets.=20

The $1,200 rent doesn't include any utilities, but all bills are around $=
70 a month. To secure the room, I am requesting first months rent, last m=
onths rent and 1 month security (that you will get back upon good conditi=
on at move out).=20

The apartment:
The apartment is newly refurbished (2013) with new appliances, cabinets, =
and hardwood floors. The bedroom and living room are yours, and the kitch=
en and bathroom are shared with me. The two bedrooms are on opposite ends=
, with a kitchen/dining area and two living rooms separating them. The ki=
tchen is fairly large, and it is equipped with all the standard appliance=
s. Beyond the kitchen is your living room, and beyond that is my living r=
oom and bedroom (railroad style with a curtain separator). The bedrooms a=
re small (9x6) with no closet space, but has a large window and extra hig=
h ceilings. Your room is in the back of the house so you won't have stree=
t noise.=20

There's an outdoor patio with a nice place to chill on the Astroturf and =
under an umbrella with a nice view of Dumbo. The bathroom is located off =
of my living room. It is small, but nice with storage. It has a full-size=
 tub and shower. You'll have a shelf for your toiletries.

The apartment comes furnished or unfurnished. For $800 you can get it ful=
ly furnished (twin size bed and frame, desk, A/C window unit, sleeper sof=
a, small Smart TV, bookshelf, garment rack) or you can buy stuff from me =
a la carte as I will be selling everything separately.

The building:=20
I am on the 2nd floor up one flight of stairs in a split-level duplex wit=
h 2 guys living above me and a woodworking/construction company below.=20=


Subways/Transport:
It is the best place for subway access - 2 blocks from the Union St R, 3 =
blocks from the Carroll St F &amp; G, less than a mile from Atlantic Barc=
lay's terminal (B, Q, N, R, 2, 3, 4, 5, lirr) and Hoyt - Schermerhorn (A,=
 C, G).=20

The neighborhood:=20
&quot;Up and coming&quot; Gowanus less than a block away from a park, com=
munity pool, Proteus Gowanus Art Gallery, Ample Hills Ice Cream, and Shuf=
fleboard Bar. The block itself is still pretty industrial and near a lot =
of auto-body shops and warehouses but in between Carroll Gardens, Boerum =
Hill, and Park Slope, with plenty of restaurants, gyms, event spaces, bar=
s, coffee shops, shopping, laundry, and grocery stores within an easy wal=
king distance.=20

The space:=20
This is a safe space. Queer-friendly, no racists, sexists, or homophobes.=
 I am looking for the obvious roommate: a respectful, considerate person =
who is tidy and pays rent on-time. It's a meat-free (flexible) and cigare=
tte-free (required) apartment.=20

About me:=20
I'm a Web Designer in my late-twenties. I have a flexible work schedule a=
nd I am either traveling, working from home, or working from my office in=
 Manhattan.

$1,725.00 Per Month, East Village, Manhattan, 190 sq. ft., Large bedroom =
in East Village townhouse
Available: Oct 02, 2014 through Jan 31, 2015

Roomy bedroom available in two-story townhouse with own entrance - condo =
has three bedrooms and two full baths. The available room is on the secon=
d floor of the apartment (third floor of building), with two windows and =
a full built-in closet. It shares the floor with the other bedroom, laund=
ry room and a bath (with tub).=20

The room is 11.9 by 16 (almost 200 square feet!), faces 11th street and g=
ets sun throughout the day and, due to position on the 3rd floor, street =
noise is minimized. As well as the five-foot wide closet with shelving wi=
thin the room, there is additional storage available in a closet on the f=
loor.

The end date is flexible.

The room is partially furnished but can be empty if desired. The room is =

The apartment has washer/dryer and dishwasher with hardwood floors throug=
hout and individually-controlled heat and A/C. Second floor has a great s=
kylight at stair top. Kitchen is well stocked, with a central island and =
open floor plan to the living room, as well as the occupied bedroom and s=
econd bath. The first floor is fully furnished.

The two current housemates are busy, out a lot and quiet when at home. Oc=
casional hangouts in the kitchen are friendly and social, but usually whe=
n home, folks are working...

The neighborhood is terrific. Five minutes one direction takes you to the=
 bucolic East River walk and every other direction takes you to cafes, re=
staurants, shops and bars or Tompkins Square Park. Easy walk to 1st Ave L=
, a few minutes more to Union Square (passing Traders Joe's on the way), =
and busses on the avenues (express bus at 1st Ave.)=20

The house is clean, well maintained and breezy, and feels like a home. Th=
ere is a quiet, shy cat who lives in the apartment and we are not looking=
 for more pets.

Thanks and good luck.

$850.00 Per Month, Crown Heights, Brooklyn, 10' 7&quot; x 15' 5&quot; and=
 10' x 12' sq. ft., 2 adjoining rooms for rent in Crown Heights apartment=
!
Available: Oct 01, 2014

2 adjoining rooms available in Crown Heights apartment!

I am a male artist, in my late 20's, looking for a roommate. I am easy to=
 live with, responsible, clean, and spend most of time working different =
jobs, or working in my small studio on my side of the apartment. I live i=
n 2 adjoining rooms at the front side of the apartment.

Preferred roommate would also be male, 20's to early 30's, responsible, n=
on-smoker (or smokes outside), and can tidy up after themselves.

The apartment is on the 2nd floor of a Crown Heights home, with just one =
other apartment occupying the first floor. You get a ton of personal spac=
e for the price! The larger room is approximately 10'7&quot; x 15' 5&quot=
;, with 3 south-facing windows, a small built-in storage space, and an A/=
C unit that I can leave in for your use. The smaller room is approximatel=
y 10' x 12', with a large closet, and overhead storage space. In the past=
, Ive used the smaller room as an office, and a small home studio.

The trade-off is that there isn't a common living room space. Please note=
 if this is a deal breaker for you.

The kitchen and bathroom are not newly renovated, but are clean and in de=
cent shape. For the cooking enthusiasts, we have a gas stove. For others,=
 we have a solid microwave.=20

Utilities (Gas, Electric, Internet) are split down the middle. Room is cu=
rrently set up with cable, but don't really care if we keep it or not. He=
at and Hot Water included.

Attractions

The apartment is located within a (true) 10 to 15 minute walk along Easte=
rn Parkway to the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens, Brooklyn Art Museum, Brookl=
yn Public Library, and Prospect Park. (Think Prospect Park Summer Concert=
s, Brooklyn Art Museum Target First Saturdays, etc.)

There are lots of Restaurants, Bars, and Cafes along Franklin Ave and Nos=
trand Ave! Laundry is 1 block away.

Unfortunately, the landlord doesn't allow pets.

I'm looking for someone that could stay 6+ months or longer. Security dep=
osit ($850), and 1st months rent is required to move in. No lease require=
d, but proof of employment/income is.

$1,200.00 Per Month, Gowanus, Brooklyn, Room for rent in Gowanus Brownsto=
ne
Available: Oct 01, 2014

Looking for one male or female roommate to fill the second room in this a=
wesome Gowanus brownstone. Room is 13'x6, has hardwood floors, a window w=
ith space for an air conditioner, and a closet. Rent is $1,200 per month,=
 plus half of whatever the electricity/internet comes out to be. Photos s=
hown are from broker's original listing. I just recently moved in myself,=
 and am still working on furnishing the place.=20

The apartment itself is newly renovated with a stainless steel kitchen, i=
ncluding dishwasher and microwave. The two bedrooms are side by side in t=
he rear of the building overlooking quiet gardens. The apartment features=
 original pine floors, high ceilings, large windows and a deco fireplace =
in the livingroom. Owner (who lives in the building, super friendly) also=
 just added a new washer/dryer in the basement, along with large extra st=
orage cages that you/we can opt into for $50 a month as needed.

The neighborhood is pretty great too, and is honestly what drew me to ren=
ting the place to begin with. Everything you might need is within a few b=
locks. Four &amp; Twenty Blackbirds pie shop (priorities), new Whole Food=
s a 5 minute walk away along with a market closeby, tons of restaurants a=
nd bars within walking distance on 5th ave, etc. Really nice vibe.

About me: I'm an easygoing 24 y/o nerdy graphic designer who likes dudes.=
 My friends tell me I'm a very sincere person, and I'd like to believe th=
em. I work full time, generally around 9:30am to 6/7pm during the week, a=
nd throw around a few side projects/freelance stuff when they show up. As=
 far as downtime is concerned, I spend a ton of time playing video games,=
 so I'm pretty quiet. I'd like the place to stay generally clean, but I'm=
 not crazy about it. I know how easily messes can accumulate, so I just a=
sk that you confine any crazy amount of clutter to your room and keep the=
 shared spaces in a decent state.

It'd be nice to have a friendly relationship with whoever takes the room,=
 but it's not the end of the world if you just wanna be roomies and leave=
 it at that. I'm happy to have a casual chat/drinks after work now and ag=
ain, or not if that's not your thing. It's more important that you just..=
.not be an asshole. Considerate, responsible, etc. Also equally important=
 that you can make the rent on time, so please have a steady job.

If this all sounds good to you, drop me an email with a little about your=
self so we can get the ball rolling.

Dogs are allowed if approved by owner, but no cats.

ly, we should get along fine.  =20

$900.00 Per Month, BedStuy, Brooklyn, Room in a community-minded apartmen=
t in a beautiful 4BR brownstone
Available: Oct 01, 2014

We are starting a community-oriented home in BedStuy, and we have just se=
cured an amazing top-floor 4-bedroom apartment 3 blocks from the Nostrand=
 AC. We are looking for people who want to live in a way that builds comm=
unity around cooking and laughing together, freely communicating, support=
ing each other, and having fun. We are queer-friendly, and we want to liv=
e with people who bring energy and creativity to their living environment=
.

The apartment is open October 1 or sooner, and we would like to move quic=
kly on finding the right people for this community. We are signing a 1-ye=
ar lease, and we would like you to join us on it.

About the apartment
There are two good-sized rooms available, each 900 with its own window, c=
loset, and plenty of natural light. Both are big enough for doubles or qu=
eens. The common space is an open layout, and there are two full bathroom=
s.

About us
All of us have been living in communal situations for several years now, =
and we have a good sense of what works and what kind of investment is nee=
ded from everyone. In DC, C and M helped start a communal group house tha=
t became a hub for neighborhood potlucks, gardening, music and poetry sha=
res, and other good stuff. The key to that collective was low-drama peopl=
e and shared commitment, so that's what we want to build on here. In Lond=
on and L.A, Y lived in communities that gently nurtured and supported the=
 individuals who lived there, building friendships that have lasted many =
years and spanned many continents. The key to these collectives was kindn=
ess, a sense of humor, and genuine friendships that encourage and honor t=
he space we need to grow as individuals, as much as the sharing we need t=
o feel a part of a little family.

M: I'm 33 years old and I work for a non-profit that supports social entr=
epreneurs. In my daydreams (and sometimes in real life), I am a vigilante=
 making the streets safe for biking and for being a woman. I am at my bes=
t when I feel grateful and adventurous, which happens most when:
--I use travel as therapy. Most cathartic/transformative places I've trav=
eled: Bangladesh, Burma, Central African Republic, Burning Man and the Di=
strict of Columbia.
--I invite friends over and we spend hours cooking together. I love liste=
ning to people's stories and talking about how to live a life that matter=
s.
--I lift weights. I think I might have something like synesthesia with we=
ights, because they all have different personalities to me, which definit=
ely keeps it exciting.
--I explore aspects of religion and spirituality, which I do both experie=
ntially and philosophically (though I'm allergic to dogma). This approach=
 probably stems from spending the first 16 years of my life in Munich, ra=
ised by missionary parents. . .

C: I'm a 29-year-old full-time grad student in philosophy and women's/gen=
der studies. I'm spending a lot of time on my studies (and teaching) righ=
t now, but I counterbalance that with quality time with friends, homebuil=
ding, and exploring my city. I like interacting with people, and I build =
my relationships around listening, sharing, and laughing together. I'm a =
project-oriented person, so I work hard to create things: starting a Tae =
Kwon Do school, learning how to fix my bike, cultivating a sense of belon=
ging in my neighborhood (i.e., &quot;becoming a regular&quot;). I grew up=
 in a small rural town outside of Northampton, MA (behind the tofu curtai=
n, as my friends in eastern MA say), which is reflected in my love of kal=
e and cider vinegar.

Y: I'm 42, female, British, and I'm a professional composer and a publish=
ed author. I've moved to New York to work with a radio station, and to be=
 the Creative Director for a new independent record label. I also compose=
 music for orchestras etc, which is a silent task on a laptop, like writi=
ng a book etc. Oh, and I'm currently writing a book. I grew up in London,=
 but I've lived and traveled all over the world, from Japan to Europe, co=
oking and eating wherever I go, and playing and listening to music as I t=
ravel. Kindness is my religion, listening is my goal. Focus is essential =
for creation, and beauty reflects grace, which is why I'm excited to grow=
 community in this historic, elegant home.

About you
Tell us who you are and what you are passionate about. What is your exper=
ience with communal/cooperative living? What are you looking for in a liv=
ing situation? Also, let us know what you do for work and how else you li=
ke to spend your time. Unfortunately, if a pet is a part of your life, it=
 can't come live in the apartment.

Please reply with enough detail to give us a good sense of yourself. We l=
ook forward to hearing from you, as soon as possible!=20

Two joined rooms in a railroad with separate entrances. Your studio/offic=

n dishes and like to keep shared space clean. Would suit someone who work=

Me: laid back Polish-Aussie, do marketing and events at a startup so I'm =
out all day and most evenings and travel frequently. I'm also a  jeweler,=
 obsessive about cleaning the bathroom, hate mopping but do my dishes. Ri=
de my bike everywhere and like being outside.

I treat my home as a sanctuary so looking for someone who feels the same =
way. Landlord lives below us and is friendly and responsive if things go =
wrong. No pets and no couples please. Tell me a bit about yourself in the=
 email and we can set up a time to view!=20

$1,350.00 Per Month, East Village, Manhattan, Bright and Sunny Private ro=
om in the East Village
Available: Oct 01, 2014

I am unfortunately leaving the East Village relatively soon and need to f=
ill my room in this incredible apartment.=20

A little bit about the apartment: this is a duplex (the second floor bein=
g a bedroom loft) 4-bedroom apartment. Three bedrooms on the first floor,=
 and one above -- the room that is on the first floor. It is the top floo=
r of a six-story building with roof access that is incredible -- views of=
 the Empire State Building, Chrysler Building, and partial views of the W=
illiamsburg Bridge and Manhattan Bridge. The entire apartment is incredib=
ly bright and airy with a stocked kitchen, tv, internet, and cable.=20

A bit about the room: the room is a comfortable size -- I have a queen si=
zed bed, trunk, bedside table, night stand, desk, and dresser in my room =
currently and I love it. There are two beautiful windows that look out ov=
er a small community garden right across the street. There is a sizable c=
loset in the room as well.=20

The roommates: Three guys all super busy and super laid back, all in thei=
r mid-twenties to early 30's. One guy is in and out, staying at his girlf=
riend's spot a bunch and is a restaurant manager with long hours. The oth=
er two work in downtown Manhattan with long hours too, so the apartment i=
s never all that crowded given the fact its a 4-bedroom.=20

And if you don't know the East Village all that well -- this neighborhood=
 is really amazing. This apartment is on the cusp of the Lower East Side,=
 Alphabet city, and the East village with easy subway access (also, 12 mi=
nutes walking to SoHo, NoHo, and the heart of it all). Great bars and res=
taurants literally all around.=20

It sucks that I have to move out, this apartment is really great, but I h=
ave to be out by October 1. What is required is first, last, and security=
. There is no lease to sign, simply move in!

1 bedroom available in a great apartment building in Hell's Kitchen. The =

eck with great views of midtown.  The apartment itself is a 2 bedroom con=
vert.  The other bedroom is currently being occupied by a clean, quiet an=
d responsible 23 year-old female. The bedroom available is the bigger of =
the two, has its own central air conditioner and controls, and has a larg=
e closet.  The room will be unfurnished, unlike these pictures, but it ve=

Available: Oct 01, 2014 through Sept 30, 2015

Hello! I have a room opening up October 1 for a one-year sublet in my 2 b=
ed/ 1 bath apartment in Greenpoint on India St between Franklin and West,=
 half a block from the ferry and 2 blocks from the G train. The apartment=
 is a second floor duplex and the landlords live downstairs with their ch=
ild. I've lived here over 5 years and I love this apartment and how quiet=
 and neighborhoody the area is.

Rent is $1300/month plus bills (usually $30-50/month). First and last mon=
th's rent plus one month deposit for move in.

The room: 95sf, big enough to comfortably fit a queen size bed, a dresser=
, and a desk. Unfurnished or you can buy the (fairly new and very comfy) =
bed and desk from my current roommate. It has a smallish closet and a sun=
ny window.

The roommate (me!): female, 31, vegetarian (but don't care if you are), o=
riginally from Texas. I'm into origami, whiskey, and Mexican food. I have=
 a sweet, shy cat named Kitty. Sadly we can't have any more pets. I'm a f=
reelance shoe designer and I bartend a few nights a week at my friends' b=
ar.

You: Responsible, considerate, reasonably quiet, reasonably clean, financ=
ially stable, non smoking, friend of Kitty. Sorry, no couples.

 be showing the apartment this weekend.

$1,350.00 Per Month, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, Sunny Sublet in Greenpoint for=
 the Summer (bedroom + private living space)
Available: Oct 01, 2014 through Oct 31, 2014

Looking for someone to take my amazing two room space in a railroad apart=
ment in Greenpoint near the Nassau ave stop.  Great space with lots of li=
ght, it has full sun all day and looks out onto the many back gardens of =
my housing block.  The bed is in its only room that stays cool and has do=
ors that can be shut during the day to make the living room area more coz=
y. The only space shared with my roommate is the kitchen and bathroom.=20=


Amazing locations, a couple blocks away from Mccaren Park, which has fiel=
ds, track, and public swimming pool, and in walking distance to all the g=
reat restaurants and bars of Greenpoint.  It's on the border of Williamsb=
urg and walking distance to the L train.=20

My roommate is a super friendly gay guy in his early 30s who works at a r=
ecord store and DJs. We both keep to ourselves, the apartment feels almos=
t like a studio, but love socializing via the kitchen. We're both really =
chill so prefer someone who doesn't bring the party home.  The bathroom i=
s in the hallway, only a foot outside the kitchen door. The whole floor j=
ust feels like our apartment as  the building is really small with only o=
ne apartment on the floor above of us, also young people, who are super n=
ice, but I've rarely seen them.

I work as an artist and filmmaker and will be leaving to Europe for a cou=
ple months, so looking for someone trust worthy and respectful of the spa=
ce and my things. I don't have many belongings so will be able to clear m=
ost of the room and closet space.=20

Rent will be 1350 for including utilities.

$1,000.00 Per Month, Clinton Hill/Fort Greene, Brooklyn, NY, Medium sized=
 bedroom available for rent or sublet
Available: Sept 24, 2014

My roommate and I are both female and recent grads. We just moved into a =
3 bedroom brownstone on Clinton Ave (less than a block away from Myrtle A=
ve, less than 10 minutes to the G train at Clinton/Washington and 10-15 t=
o the C at Clinton/Washington) and we're looking to sublet the extra room=
. It's big enough for a queen bed and a closet or dresser, and there's a =
pretty large living space, kitchen and closet in the hall that would be y=
ours to use. My roommate and I are both pretty clean, non-smokers and pet=
 friendly (we might have a cat in the future so you should be pet friendl=
y, too! And I promise we're not as messy as these photos make us look -- =
we just moved in and are still organizing). We also have great taste in m=
usic and are generally pretty rad.

We're looking for someone to move in as soon as possible, but by Oct. 1 a=
t the latest. We'd prefer someone who can commit long term, and there's s=
till time to sign the year-long lease if you'd be interested in doing tha=
t. If you think you could get along with us, get in touch and we'd love t=
o meet you!=20

 street equidistant to the Bedford and Lorimer L stops. It's about 500 sq=
 ft and has a large balcony with a handmade table (from a tree trunk in m=
y hometown). The balcony overlooks multiple backyards with trees and bird=
s. It's really great for writing or just relaxing. Washer and dryer in th=
e building. Completely furnished with kitchenware, towels and sheets. Pet=
s allowed. I've got some choice pieces up on the walls too. Kubrick's Lol=
ita movie poster. A little TV with a DVD/VHS player. Bathtub.

It's a very quiet building with only a couple units so I would love someo=
ne considerate and not too loud. I'm throwing in my bike with a bike lock=
 too! (which gets to stay in the foyer downstairs at night)

It's a real gem of a place. I've lived in this neighborhood for almost a =
decade and I haven't found many studios as great as this one.

If you're a design aficionado and appreciate technology, you'll love this=

 colors, except the small bedroom, which is all white. Then I installed a=
 new floor and had my best pieces of furniture recovered. Finally, I inst=
alled a Hue lighting system that can be controlled by your iPhone or a re=
mote. You can read about the apartment and see photos of it in the Europe=

I must leave New York for October, and I'd like to offer my place to a pe=

My place is lovely and cozy, with beautiful morning light and access to t=
he roof for sunsets. I have a small working studio if that can be useful =
to you. I also have a new bed and a long claw foot tub; perfect as we tur=
n to Autumn! My place likes to stay tidy and would be best for one who is=
 particular in that way- it's a bit Japanese in arrangement.
=20
We have a super grocery next to the park, Archies pizza- open til 4am, co=
ffee-bars, Miles, Tandem, and King Noodle!! all within a few blocks.=20
Close to the M at Central, the J at Myrtle, and the L at Morgan

$1,000.00 Per Month, Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, New York, Digital Art C=
onservator looking for home
Available: Nov 01, 2014

Hello, I am a 38 year old male who moved to NY from Europe in April, for =
my new job as a digital art conservator at New Museum / Rhizome.

My current sublet in Washington Heights is running out in November and I =
would like to take the chance to move closer to my work and experience an=
other neighborhood in the city. I would at least want to stay for six mon=
ths, but longer or shorter should also be possible.

I am tidy, responsible, reliable and financially stable (100% employed), =
don't smoke and do not own any pets. In general my belongings are rather =
minimal, so I would prefer a furnished place for rent or a sublet.

My working schedule keeps me busy, every now and then also on the weekend=
, but sometimes I also like to (quietly) work on some stuff at home.

Probably you will find me pleasant to be around. I have many different in=
terests, worked in art, music and science, and wouldn't mind moving in wi=
th somebody nice, but am also content on my own.

Looking forward to your messages!

Thanks for reading and considering. I am a 48 y.o. self-employed consulti=

y 9 y.o. English Bulldog, Lefty. He is very well trained (NYC curb traine=

ional security deposit for him. Ideally, the place would be fairly close =
to a Metro North rail station, but I do have a car, so it need not be wal=
king distance. Most important is a good-size lot or close proximity to wo=
ods / trails for my buddy. Would consider a long-term situation (lease) i=
f an ideal situation. Thanks!

$1,000.00 Per Month, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, 25 Male Web Developer Seeking =
Comfortable Living Space
Available: Oct 01, 2014

Howdy!
My name is Tim. I'm a 25 year old single straight guy doing web developme=
nt. I'm looking for a place to live in Greenpoint or Williamsburg.

My ideal living situation is with roommates who are down to earth working=
 professionals. Don't want no drama! Male or female. I'm very respectful,=
 and care about having a living environment where everyone feels comforta=
ble and happy. And if issues come up, having an open, honest dialogue to =
resolve them.

I like keeping communal spaces clean and tidy. I would enjoy having it be=
 fairly quiet after 11pm or so most nights. However, I'm not inflexible a=
bout things. Sometimes a roommate has friends / a date over, and there's =
a bit of noise. So I'm just talking about the scene on average.

I enjoy drinking in moderation. I'll probably go out with friends on the =
weekends pretty regularly. I like listening to music, but being reasonabl=
e about the noise. I like playing video games.

Basically, I just want a fun, respectful environment where everyone can b=
e themselves, have fun, and be comfortable. If you are a reasonable human=
 with such a space to offer, I would love to talk to you and see it!

Thanks!

Hello everyone,

My name is William Ramirez and I just recently moved to the city (about a=
 month ago) to start graduate school. I am working on my masters in Latin=
 American and Caribbean Studies at NYU. Right now, I am looking for a mor=
e comfortable place to live. Something that is within a 30-40 minute comm=
ute to NYU/Washington Square Park. I'm looking for something within Queen=
s, Manhattan, or Brooklyn.=20
I am able to move anytime starting October 15 and am looking to stay long=
 term (6-12months).
Because, I am very new to the city and haven't worked full-time here yet,=
 I am looking for a sublet. I will be paying rent mostly with the financi=
al aid that I am receiving from school. My budget allows for something up=
 to $1,100.=20
I, generally, a pretty clean, respectful, and quiet person. For the most =
part, I am going to be pretty busy with school and a part-time job I have=
 on campus so, I won't be spending a lot of time at home. I also usually =
prefer to study at the library or at a cafe. I am open to rooming with ei=
ther men or women (someone more or less around my age but, I'm open to mo=
re mature people).=20
If you think I sound like someone you'd like to rent out a room to, pleas=
e, let me know!! I'm looking forward to hearing back from you all!!

Dear Prospective Landlord,

I hope this message finds you well.

My name is Sanae,=20
I'm a 32 year old single woman in search of a new home. I would love to b=
ecome your new tenant!

I've lived in my neighborhood for years and it's been over 4 months now t=
hat I've been searching for my new home. I'm really trying to stay in the=
 area and ideally, I need to move anytime before mid-October but can wait=
 for the right space.

I'm a gainfully employed creative, I can do just about anything with rega=
rds to aesthetic and design. This means if your space needs a little fixi=
ng up, I would be more than happy to give it some love, its what I do bes=
t!

As a tenant I am very quiet and respectful of my space, neighbors, and co=
mmunity. I always pay my bills on time and truly make my space my home an=
d sanctuary. I work a lot and I do not smoke nor have any pets. My presen=
t landlord would be more than happy to give me a really great reference.

I know I'm looking for quite the needle or gem if you will in a haystack =
and I'm really trying to stay in my neighborhood (Fort Greene / Clinton H=
ill) but I'm open to going a little outwards south and west. Fortunately =
I have a lot flexibility with my move-in date, finding the right space is=
 most important to me.

I am looking for an unfurnished pre-war space for long term lease, I'm op=
en to lease take-overs as well.

I love original details and charm, I'm not concerned about renovations, I=
 would be more than happy to do them myself.

I am open to two room / alcove studios but I really think I need a true o=
ne bedroom to accommodate my furniture, I'm aware this will be a difficul=
t find.=20

I'm not looking for a basement/garden apartment.
I'm not looking for a share situation but a place of my own.=20
Thanks for taking the time to read this.=20

Warmest Regards-
Your Future Tenant

$1,100.00 Per Month, Greenpoint/Bushwick/Other, Brooklyn, Quiet, Consider=
ate Writer Looking for Great Apartment
Available: Oct 01, 2014

Hello. My name is Geoffrey Bankowski.

I currently live in Greenpoint, Brooklyn and am looking for a quiet, clea=
n, and mature living situation. By this I mean a thoughtful sharing of sp=
ace, clear and transparent communication regarding bills and any issues t=
hat might arise, etc.

I work full time, and also teach writing classes at Hunter College and wo=
rk freelance for HarperCollins. I have an MFA in poetry, and have spent m=
y almost seven years in NYC (originally from Michigan) engaged with writi=
ng and making hand-torn paper collage (geoffreybankowski.com) (Fear not: =
no messy art space or drama).=20

I am a very clean, organized person, but not neurotic about it. As we kno=
w, in NYC space is at a premium, and when it gets cluttered or dirty, its=
 just not as nice to come home to. I'm very considerate of others' space =
because, well, it's the right thing to do.=20

I enjoy good conversations and genuine social interaction, but don't need=
 it all the time and like and need quiet time to work or read or watch as=
 many documentary films as is possible. My interests span from the myster=
ies of deep space or deep sea to psychology to the beauty of a good bridg=
e to what effect talking to my plants really has to really good loose-lea=
f tea to building bookcases to practicing yoga to all types of thoughtful=
 music.=20

Frankly, I expect this might be difficult to find in my price range. I do=
 need a bit of space- either a sizeable room or some of the common space =
for a few pieces (said bookcases, a work table, a vintage file cabinet us=
ed as dresser, etc.). But it would be great to add to or help create a ca=
lm, aesthetically pleasing space in which to both rest and work creativel=
y.=20

I am certainly open to changing neighborhoods if necessary. Though I ride=
 my bike to work daily over the Williamsburg Bridge, so something allowin=
g that would be important.=20

Thank you for your time. Please let me know if you think I might be a goo=
d fit for your space. Best of luck regardless.

Lgbt history &amp; culture, $30.00, Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn, The Ga=
y Graves Tour
Available: Oct 05, 2014 through Oct 05, 2014

The Gay Graves Tour of Green-Wood Cemetery, a National Historic Landmark =
in Brooklyn, will introduce you to the famous and the not-so-famous gay m=
en and lesbians who are among the permanent residents at Green-Wood.
=20
The Gay Graves Tour is conducted entirely on foot. It is a very vigorous =
tour, a real hike because of the amount of territory covered and the hill=
y nature of the terrain. The tour begins at the fabulous Victorian Gothic=
 gate to Green-Wood. We visit the final resting places of four composers:=
 Louis Moreau Gottschalk, Leonard Bernstein, Paul Jabara and Fred Ebb; an=
d we learn about the groundbreaking lesbian artists, Violet Oakley and Em=
ma Stebbins.

Although the tour highlights the gay men and lesbians buried at Green-Woo=
d, we cannot ignore the Roosevelt family, TRs parents and his first wife =
