Hello List-
Here are listings as of 6/19/13
Listings Project Story of the Week:
Thank you!  I tried to rent my place on Craig's List and heard nothing for =
2 weeks.
 I was in a panic and confused.  I finally gave up and listed my place on y=
our list
and was flooded with responses the first hour and I heard from great people=
. I also
listed my place on another listing site and there was no comparison. The pe=
ople=20
from your list are trustworthy and personable.  I am not sure how you do it=
.  There
was not one unkind person who called me.
I rented my place a week ago.  Thank you for magically gathering all of New=
 York
 City's polite, interesting and kind artists and people.
Laurie

$450 per month, Williamsburg, Desk and studio space for designers, writers,=
 photographers,
artists
Available: July 1 through ----
We are an artist and craftsman who just rented a huge space, slated to  be =
a collaborating
ground for some upcoming projects, that is way too  big for us. We are hopi=
ng to
 find a handful of creative professionals to  share it with us. We have a v=
ariety
of spaces, all flooded with natural  light, in a single-story former kosher=
 bakery
in South Williamsburg.
The Bakery is almost a century old, and we have spent the last few  months =
giving
it a deluxe facelift: New walls, new skylights, endless  gallons of paint, =
and insulation
for the 15 foot ceilings.
We hope it will become an open space full of collaborative individuals,  ea=
ting=20
lunch together, joining forces when appropriate, enjoying happy  hour on th=
e roof,
and being more productive for it. We've built in  meeting spaces, working s=
paces,
and a flexible gallery/storefront for  art shows or pop-up shops.
We'd like to curate our studio mates carefully, people using different  pro=
cesses
but with common goals and we're looking foreword to having  more voices to =
weigh
 in on the future of The Bakery. Right now it's just  a baby space, it will=
 be up
to all of us to raise it right!
We a re curious to hear from anyone who needs desk space, office space  or =
clean
 studio space. Membership starts at 400, depending on the type  of space yo=
u need.
Call us up or send us an email, we are super excited  to find out what you'=
re working
on!

$530 , Bushwick/Ridgewood, Summer Studio Sublet
Available: July 1st-Sept. 1st
I'm going to sublet my studio in the 1717 Troutman St. studio building  fro=
m July
1st-Sept 1st.  I'm looking for one responsible, respectful  person to take =
the space,
or two friends to share it. The studio has 3  large working walls, the fron=
t wall
is 12' tall and 22' wide, and the  side walls are also around 20' long.  Th=
ere is
also a 4th wall 8' tall  and 8' wide.  The studio is private, has a metal/d=
ouble-door
entrance.   The ceiling is 14' tall, and there is 2' of shared air up at th=
e ceiling
 above the front wall to another space.  I needed to include this  airspace=
 to aid
with airflow.  The artists on the other side are  responsible, respectful p=
eople
 and I'm sure they would appreciate the  same from you.  We've never disrup=
ted eachother.
 The total square  footage of the studio is around 500/sq ft., but that inc=
ludes
 my  storage.  The working area you would have access to is a large square,=
  little
over 400 sq/ft.
1717 Troutman is a great studio building, with dozens of artists, and  seve=
ral art
galleries.  It also has a nice roof deck.  You may find  being in this comm=
unity
 a good resource.  The building has a loading  dock, and freight elevator a=
s well.
I request the two months at $530/month (that includes electric assuming  th=
ere isn't
a huge spike in electric usage) and security deposit of  $300, for a total =
of $1,360
upfront.  The $300 security deposit will be  returned when I receive the ke=
ys back,
and my studio is in good  condition, as I'll need to be back in my studio a=
nd working
immediately  upon my return.

$350.0 per month, Bushwick, 220 sq. feet, Large studio in shared space, gre=
at light.
Available: 7/1/2013 through 9/30/2013
I'm subletting my Bushwick/Ridgewood studio for 3 months while I'll be away=
 at a
 residency, July-September, 2013.
The studio is approximately 220 sq. feet, with north-facing windows. It  ha=
s amazing
light during the day. Rent is $350/month + utilities  ($10-$20 in the summe=
r). I'm
also asking for a $100 deposit for the  sublet.
The studio is located in the 1717 Troutman building (Regina Rex &  Parallel=
 Art=20
Space are both in the building). It's a private studio  within a larger spa=
ce shared
with 10 other artists. There is also a  shared wood shop with a table saw a=
nd chop
saw. There's even a shared  roof deck with a panoramic view of the city.
I will need to leave some of my work and materials in the space, but I  wil=
l try
 and clear out as much room as possible, hopefully getting most  everything=
 up onto
the storage loft.
There are some pictures of the space here: http://jeremyolson.com/studio-su=
blet
I'll be available to show it this Saturday, the 22nd.

$1250 per month, Clinton Hill/Bedstuy, Bedroom w/office space and backyard
Available: July 7 through whenever
Hello,
I'm subletting a room with an office in my apartment in Clinton Hill/Bed  S=
tuy 5
 minutes to Bedford-Nostrand G train stop. The apartment gets  lots of sun =
light
 and there's a backyard and basement for storage. There  are plenty of grea=
t places
to get food and coffee in the hood, and tons  of stuff on Myrtle ave and ab=
out 15
minute walk to the heart of Clinton  Hill.
I'm looking for a steadily employed woman or man late 20s-early 30s to  sha=
re this
place. When I move out of the apartment you could very well  take over the =
lease.
About me: I'm 35 year old male, work in media in  midtown Manhattan, quiet,=
 respectful,
and try to keep a clean place. If  you're a reasonable human being, not int=
o drugs,
steadily employed,  please message me.
To move in you'll need first month and security.
Depending on how long you'd like to stay and if we're compatible, it is  po=
ssible
to throw up a wall in the living so that the living room is  turned into a =
new bedroom
for you. There is also a space that can  function as an office. Once you st=
op by
 and see the place, it'll be  easier to explain.

$800 per month, Bushwick, 10' x 13', Large, Sunny, Bedroom with High Ceilin=
g in=20
Bushwick
Available: July 4 through Indefinite
We are looking for a new roommate, ideally for early July. We need  someone=
 to take
over a bedroom in our three-bedroom apartment in  Bushwick. It's a loft apa=
rtment
in a big converted industrial building  near the corner of Wilson Avenue an=
d Dekalb
Avenue. The apartment is  newly refinished with new walls and new hardwood =
floors.
It's got big  windows and is very sunny. We have a big living room, a kitch=
en and
a  bathroom. There is roof access, free internet and 25 cent laundry  machi=
nes in
the basement. Utilities are about $50 each per month. Your  room is big by =
north
 Brooklyn standards with big windows, high ceilings  and lots of sun. It's =
hard=20
to give exact dimensions because the room is  L-shaped and has lots of diag=
onals
 but it's about 10 feet by 13 feet.  Rent is 800$ a month.
You can walk to most of the Bushwick bars and coffee shops in 5 to 10  minu=
tes.=20
We are near the Central Ave M train and the Dekalb Ave L train.  This makes=
 it very
easy to get to Williamsburg and Manhattan.
I am David, a gardener and my roommate Ben is an art handler. I do  photogr=
aphy=20
in my free time and he paints very seriously. We are both  about 30 and loo=
king=20
for someone who is fun but also responsible and  relatively clean. It's imp=
ortant
that you be financially secure and able  to pay rent in full on the first o=
f every
month. You will also need to  pay last months rent and a security deposit t=
otaling
1600$.
Please tell us about your employment, age, interests and hobbies. Tell  us =
what=20
you like to do when at home and what schedule you keep. If you  like, throw=
 in a
 little information about your favorite books, music,  films etc...
Thanks for looking!

 North
Carolina that i can vouch for as being laid  back, courteous, and responsib=
le.
The neighborhood has become increasingly popular in the past 3  years.There=
 is a
 green gym (what qualifies it as 'green' is honestly  beyond me) next door.=
 a coffee
shop and bike shop across the street.  Roberta's pizza is a block away in a=
ddition
to many bars. Conveniently  the loft remains quiet unless you bring the noi=
se. =20

nt most
evenings and some days. just let me know.

Available: July 15 through negotiable
We're looking for someone to share our lovely apartment. The room is  curre=
ntly=20
furnished with a bed, desk and dresser, some plants and some  art which can=
 stay
 for a while if you need them. There are 3 bedrooms, a  living room, a kitc=
hen and
2 bathrooms. The bedroom gets lovely winter  light but is mostly shady in s=
ummer.
The 2 roommates in the house are relaxed and lovely people in their 30's  w=
ho eat
well and enjoy life. One is a massage therapist/yoga teacher  and the other=
 an actor/teacher.
We do a lot of cooking, fermenting, roasting and sprouting in our  totally =

e PSFCoop,
which is a 15min bike ride. Some of us are  gluten free and none of us are =
vegetarian,
but we're all flexible.
We are all cyclists and are well located for bike routes at the  intersecti=
on of
 the Dean Street and Bedford Routes and it's about a  15min ride to Downtow=
n BK,
 20 to Williamsburg and 5 min walk to an A/C  express train stop.
Neighborhood wise, parts of Crown Heights are becoming increasingly more  g=
entrified,
yet our immediate area is mostly Caribbean food places and  Dollar stores. =
It's=20
about an 8 minute walk to a 3$ coffee. There are  grocery stores, hardware =
and drugstores
all within a 5 minute walk, and  the Laundromat is at the end of our block.
If you think you could happily participate in this living situation, please=
 get=20

ent,=20
$1200 1.5 sunny bedrooms - your own wing July 1
Available: July 1

 own,

lived
 in my apartment for 11 years, don't drink or smoke cigarettes  and enjoy a=
 quiet,
comfortable home life, although since I'm a musician  I'm often working on =
music
 in my wing during the day and early  evenings.

from=20
most subway lines and a great array of dining, a yoga  studio, as well as t=
he Brooklyn
Museum, Botanical Gardens and Prospect  Park.

due on July 1 will be $3600.

, please
email me and tell me a little about yourself, your  lifestyle, current empl=
oyment

$975 per month, Morgan L- Bushwick, 7.5' x 21' sf lofted room, Cozy Lofted =
Room=20
in Large Sunny Loft
Available: July 1
It is a 3 bedroom loft located 3.5 blocks from the Morgan L train and  abou=
t 4 longer
blocks to the Jefferson L. If you are familiar with the  neighborhood, it h=
as cool
things going on for artists and like minded  individuals-- nice places to g=
rab drinks,
get coffee, eat food. My home  is large and sunny, a corner unit and we hav=
e views
of the Manhattan  skyline.
I am a female in my mid twenties and I like to keep good, positive vibes  a=
mong=20
roommates as well as our home clean. I have a large dog and 2  cats, so you=
 must
 be comfortable and cool living with pets (they are  total lovers- please d=
on't=20
reply if you don't like animals- thanks).
Ideally I am looking for responsible, thoughtful, clean, financially  (and =
mentally)
stable house mates. If you fit the deal and what I have  sounds good to you=
- please
email for a time to meet up!
I will have two very different lofted rooms available for July 1.
The larger room 7.5'x21'Sqft ($975)-- although it is lofted, there is a  st=
aircase
to get upstairs and there is a closet you can stand in.
The smaller room roughly 8'x8'Sqft($650)-- Also lofted, with a smaller cuto=
ut area
for clothing.
Not a space that is optimal for individuals that want to spend extended tim=
es in
 their rooms.
The communal space is really nice- the rooms (especially the smaller  one) =
are ideal
for people who will feel comfortable spending time in the  common areas. Bo=
th rooms
are furnished with full sized beds.
The rent does not include utilities or supplies (like toilet paper),  which=
 we split
3 ways. 1st month and a deposit is required to move in. I  would like to co=

$1425 per month, Fort Greene, 11'x12' AND 9'x10, Two private rooms in sunny=
  Ft.
 Greene 3-br
Available: July 1 through November 1, maybe longer
Situation: We are a married couple in our mid-30s who spend most of our  ti=
me upstate.
We come into the city here and there for onsite work or to  see friends. We=
 are=20
super quiet and courteous, artist/designers, clean  nonsmokers with no dram=
a. We've
got a medium-sized puppy who usually  comes down with us to the city. He's =
quiet
 and loves everyone.
Location: Two short blocks from beautiful Fort Greene Park, and just a  blo=
ck or
 two's walk to a bunch of restaurants, bars, markets, drug  stores, laundro=
mats,
 and coffee shops. Ten minute walk to B, D, R, Q, 2,  3, 4, 5, and G. Also =
nearby:
BAM, Pratt, the Brooklyn Flea, the Greene  Hill Food Co-op, etc.
Apartment: Our place is a third-floor walkup in a 4-story prewar  building.=
 It's
 a sort of dingy old building on a charming block in a  great neighborhood.=
 The=20
neighbors are the one big drawback to the  apartment. We've got some freque=
ntly-noisy
folks living next door and  above. It's unfortunate, but if you're willing =
to deal
with that (as we  have for years now), the place is great. It's a good-size=
d apartment
 with a spacious shared living room and average-sized kitchen and  bathroom=
.
Rooms: The two rooms we are looking to rent are two completely separate  be=
drooms
on either side of the living room and bath. One is larger: 11 x  12', with =
two windows
that look out onto the street and get lots of  light. The second room is 9x=
10' and
has a full-sized window that looks  out onto an atrium. It actually gets a =
decent
amount of light, too.
You: Ideally, we'd like to find one person to rent both rooms - the  smalle=
r one
 would be great for an artist's studio, home office, etc.  You'd have the p=
lace=20
to yourself most of the time. We are looking for  someone amiable, clean, a=
nd courteous
to keep the apartment in good  shape. The rent is $1425 for both rooms (inc=
ludes
 heat and hot water).  Internet, gas, and electric are extra.

there is one cat! we don't think she'd be keen on other animals, so ideally=

 have a job outside of the house, it's a  big space but 3 of us already som=
etimes
work from home, and it's a good  balance to make sure people are in and out=
.
the apartment is on south 5th with a wall of windows to the williamsburg  b=
ridge.
anything the apartment lacks (and it's not much) is made up in  location - =
it could
hardly be an easier commute to almost anywhere,  we're the bedford L stop o=
r the
 marcy JMZ, many buses stop nearby, it's  easy bike territory, and if you h=
ave a
 car the street parking doesn't  suck. ridiculous foodie/hip neighborhood, =
and always
getting moreso.
so, VERY high ceilings throughout (old warehouse style), big living room  s=
plit=20
into 2 'areas', extra dining nook in kitchen, 1 bathroom, 5  separate bedro=
oms.=20
your room is a decent size, not huge but definitely  not small (especially =
by this
area's standards, which are ridiculous).  there's a very well placed loft (=
hardly
any overhang in the VERY tall  room) that's generally used as a sleeping lo=
ft with
some space for  shelves or storage. it's an internal room with a wall of wi=
ndows
 to the  living room, which has a wall of windows.
this loft has a very friendly, arty, respectful & loving vibe. fyi  this is=
 NOT=20
a new construction new williamsburg apt, it's a proper loft  with all the o=

crap intact.  at home we clean up after  ourselves, we're happy to see each=
 other
when we do but occasionally go  days at a time without seeing anyone, and w=
e're=20
very  active/busy/creative people. we do NOT bring the party home, ever,  e=
xcept
 the occasional dinner party we're all involved in. this is not a  williams=
burg=20
pad to get wild in. we're 30-40, it's a chill creative  adult house.  no li=
ve-in
 significant others, occasional guests are fine  but don't expect to have p=
eople
 come stay all the time.
pretty flexible kitchen, a lot of baking and cooking goes on :)
1 bathroom isn't really a problem (fyi, spacious shower only, no tub)
we have suffered extravagant rent increases in the past years, as a  newby,=
 all=20
cards on the table, you'd be paying more than us. that was a  hard decision=
 but=20
it seems fair and neighborhood appropriate, and we've  built this cozy cast=
le over
many years... and this would let us stay in  it for the final year of our l=
ease.
 then either they'll raise it more or  they'll renovate and charge everybod=
y 2500/person
per month, so you  might as well get in while the (blech) "cheap" is still =
avail.
speaking of which - the room is not furnished but the rest of the  apartmen=
t is=20
--- so best case is that you're not carrying a ton of stuff  with you.
NOTE --- WE HAVE A BUNCH OF EXCESS STUFF, AND COULD 'FURNISH' FOR YOU  --- =
makes
 the most sense for a subletter, but open to doing this for a  potential ro=
ommate
as well.
lotta love & support for each other and our careers and interests in  this =
house
 -- people in dance, film, music... looking fwd to welcoming  somebody new =
to the
family.
please get in touch if you get an idea of where we're coming from!
if u fit the bill get in touch regardless.

$1250 per month, Carroll Gardens/Gowanus, Seeking lovely roommate for super=
 spacious
apartment
Available: July 1, 2013 through June 30, 2014
THINGS IT HAS:
- ceiling fans, lights
- nice hardwood floors
- closets, new cabinets
- new sink & fridge, old oven
- heat & hot water
- places for window AC units
- spitting distance from F, G, R
- surprising amount of natural light
- lots and lots and lots of space
- pepto bismal pink and purple walls
THINGS IT NEEDS:
- potentially newly painted walls
- a lovely roommate
Hello! I just locked down a wonderful three bedroom apartment in the  Carro=
ll Gardens/Gowanus
area and I'm looking for a roommate to fill one  of the other rooms. The ap=
artment
is ridiculously spacious with tons of  light, aside from a slightly cramped=
 bathroom,
and is located on Bond  Street between Union and Sackett.
I'm 22, female, with a job in DUMBO working for a lecture series. I'm  meti=
culously
clean, love internet, bad at cooking, like cheese, ice  cream, books, and r=
un occasionally.
You're relatively clean, also  employed, and are okay splitting the utiliti=
es, wifi,
and sharing other  mutual expenses. You also don't have pets, preferably do=
n't smoke.
Rent is $2500, so $1250 split, not including utilities and such. The  room =
for rent
is your pick, pink or purple (I'm shooting for a pink one,  there's two), i=
n a three
bedroom apartment, available as soon as July  1st for a year or less.
If this sounds even mildly appealing, feel free to send me an email with  a=
 little
bit about yourself and we can meet up for a beverage of some  sort.
Best,
Carly

$30 per day, South Slope, 1 bedroom in a 2 bedroom apartment, Super cute be=
droom
 for sublet in a 2 bedroom apartment
Available: July 4 through august 10
I have a charming 9X9 bedroom in a 2 bedroom apartment wonderfully  located=
 in South
Park Slope, on 5th avenue one block from the Prospect  Ave. R train. A seve=
n minute
walk will get you to the 4th Ave./9th St.  stop on the F/G.
Supermarket across the street, bakery next door, and if you know  Brooklyn,=
 Eagle
provision and its shelves of beers from around the world  is on the next bl=
ock!
There is a lot of light in the apartment but the bedroom doesn't have a  wi=
ndow.
 It's super cute though, Painted with bright colors with a full  size bed, =
a clothing
rack that goes from wall to wall and 2 chests of  drawers.
The apartment itself is lovely and spacious and my roommate Billy is the  n=
icest
 person on earth. He's a clown/performer/carpenter who works  outside most =
of the
time but will make you laugh when he is in. There is  a nice living room/di=
ning=20
room, an office space and a nice rooftop off  of the living room window. We=
 grow
 tomatoes and herbs there and we like  to relax under the tree. (yes there =
is a=20
tree!)
The kitchen is small but equipped with every kitchen tool on the planet!
Of course, air-conditioning and free wi-fi make this a great apartment  to =
live=20
in and for sure a comfortable home base for any visitor to NYC.
I will be gone July 4th to August 10 but will need to come back 2 nights in=

$900 per month, Bushwick, A cozy den to lay your head.
Available: July 1 through July 31
Tis time to visit the west coast and my sweet little space is all yours!
The room is on the small side but I don't mind and doubt you will  either. =
I have
made the space super comfortable and it is a lovely area  to rest after a f=
ull day
of city bustle.
I live with 2 other great guys and we share the usual common areas-  kitche=
n and
 living room. Lucky for us there are two full bathrooms- one  of which is p=
rimarily
yours! (The guys share the other one.) They are  both into music big time a=
nd continually
on the move, so the place never  feels crowded.
The apartment is convenient to all sorts of transportation that can take  y=
ou into
every direction of NYC and Brooklyn. The surrounding  neighborhoods are gre=
at for
food, street art, and interesting nooks.

 The building is a quiet one (though the neighborhood is  really lively), w=
ith families
and long-time residences, so if you are  interested in throwing parties, th=
is is
 probably not the place.
This is an amazing neighborhood! One block from the Essex Market, with  gro=
cery=20
vendors, fresh bread, and gourmet shops, and only a few minutes  from the W=
illiamsburg
Bridge and  the park along the East River.  Easy  access to the FMJZ subway=
 lines
at Delancey and Essex streets. A  laundromat is located on the first floor =
of the
building, which is  incredibly convenient.  There are so many wonderful bar=
s and
 restaurants  in this area - also just a short walk to the New Museum, Chin=
atown,
and  Soho.
Shorter term sublets will be considered - please feel free to contact for m=
ore details.

anything.
The  apartment is located in Lefferts Garden Brooklyn. It's within walking =

$1400 per month, Brooklyn - Vinegar Hill, true one-bedroom apt, whole place=
 to yourself,
a bike commuter's dream!
Available: 6/28/13 through 7/27/13
My full one-bedroom apartment is available for a month (end of June  throug=
h end
 of July--dates could be slightly flexible). It's on the edge  of Vinegar H=
ill in
Brooklyn, just one block from the Manhattan Bridge  bike ramp.
This means that the cobblestone streets of Dumbo and its galleries,  boutiq=
ues,=20
cafes, and bars are all within a 5-10 minute walk. The lovely  water-side B=
rooklyn
Bridge Park (best skyline views of Manhattan!) with  Sunday farmer's market=
 and=20
Jane's carousel are right there too. Explore  the area by Citibike bicycle =
share--there's
a station one block from my  front door. The close-by subways take me to my=
 Midtown
Manhattan office  in 25-30 minutes, door to door.
By bike:
15 minutes to the Lower East Side
20 minutes to Williamsburg
30 minutes to Midtown
20 minutes to Pratt
15 minutes to Fort Greene Park
By foot:
4 minutes to York St. F station
4 minutes to High St. A/C station
5 minutes to Dumbo
10 minutes to Brooklyn Bridge
20 minutes to Brooklyn Heights
The apartment is cozy, with a queen size bed, air conditioner in the  bedro=
om, happy
plants on the living room window sill, and a gorgeous  newly renovated kitc=
hen.=20
No TV! But wifi.
No need to lock your bike on the street, bring it up in the elevator,  and =
right
 into the apartment. Or if you own a car or like to take cabs,  the BQE, Ma=
nhattan
Bridge, and Brooklyn Bridge on-ramps are all within a  few blocks. The buil=
ding=20
has two elevators and a 24 hour doorman (who  only speaks Chinese though).
Full disclosure caveats! The common areas of the building aren't what  one =
might
 call pristine (your midwestern parents might be put off by the  incense, s=
lippers,
and granny carts in front of my neighbors' doors)  and the BQE is close-by =
and audible
(the traffic creates a white noise  effect).
Ok for couples!

$925 per month, Bushwick, Huge 1.5 rooms, Lovely sunny space (possibly live=
-work)
Available: July 1 through Sept 1
Large, sunny, happy furnished sublet available for 2-month summer sublet  (=
July=20
1st - September 1st), possibly longer. I need to head out of town  for pers=
onal=20
reasons, but I'm going to miss it here.
The apartment is 4 mins walk from the DeKalb L train (10 minutes to  Willia=
msburg),
5 mins walk from the Knickerbocker M train. Just an 8  minute walk to the J=
efferson
L stop.
Looking for a kind, respectful, down-to-earth person (ladies preferred  but=
 it's
 all case-by-case). You will be living with a lovely 27-year-old  writer an=
d restaurant
worker.
The room is large and is more like 1.5 rooms, with 3 windows and a large  c=
loset.
The room is furnished with a double bed, a desk and chair, and a  bookshelf=
. I use
the smaller room for meditation and yoga but it could  be used as a workspa=
ce.
Room has a separate entrance and it is at the end of a railroad  apartment,=
 so I
 usually go through the hall to the kitchen and bathroom  if my roommate is=
 home
 (though she doesn't mind a walk-through).
$925 includes wifi and utilities. I will need both months up front along  w=
ith a
 $200 deposit, which the landlord has asked for as well as a  sublease agre=
ement.
Will be shown this week. Thank you and good luck  with your search!

$1000 per month, Manhattan, Last-minute change in circumstances left a good=
 guy=20
in a tight spot
Available: July 1st
Hi all-
I'm hoping the expression 'when one door closes, another opens' can save  m=
e from
an exceptionally tight spot. After months of planning, my  former roommate =
and close
friend had a financial realization that forced  his hand into signing a lea=
se without
consulting me first at the last  minute, leaving me without a place to live=
 and=20
no time to do the  standard roommate search before my lease is up on June 3=
0th.
I am hoping beyond hope to find a room or sublet or really whatever I can i=
n Manhattan
before this situation gets any more dire.
I am a clean, responsible and respectful young guy- a military brat who  ha=
s been
forced to make the best of the people around me my whole life,  and then pi=
ck up
 and start fresh. I'm easy going, great sense of humor  and sane...there wo=
n't be
any issues with unannounced visitors or a  live-in significant other who su=
ddenly
doubles your NYC apartment's  occupancy.
I do not need a ton of space, nor furnishings (though I would be willing  t=
o store
my things if the opportunity for a furnished place presents  itself). Ideal=
ly I=20
would like to be close to a subway, but beggars can't  be choosers. On my l=
ist when
we were looking for places before, subway  and laundry were number one and =
two.
Financial: I am financially responsible with good credit and gainful  emplo=
yment.
I am clean (as in use a coaster every time), and appreciate  open communica=
tion=20
and mutual respect in my (your) home. I am open to  anyone, and if there's =
a dish
in the sink my reaction is to wash it  before I call a roommate meeting to =
find=20
the source.
Open to short and long term, and flexible with payment on the usual fees  a=
nd bills
so PLEASE let me know if you know of anything that could help  me out.
Thank you.

check

joining forces when appropriate, enjoying happy  hour on the roof, and bein=
g more productive for it. We've built in  meeting spaces, working spaces, a=
nd a flexible gallery/storefront for  art shows or pop-up shops. <br /> <br=

 processes but with common goals and we're looking foreword to having  more=
 voices to weigh in on the future of The Bakery. Right now it's just  a bab=

 curious to hear from anyone who needs desk space, office space  or clean s=

udio building  from July 1st-Sept 1st.  I'm looking for one responsible, re=
spectful  person to take the space, or two friends to share it. The studio =
has 3  large working walls, the front wall is 12' tall and 22' wide, and th=
e  side walls are also around 20' long.  There is also a 4th wall 8' tall  =
and 8' wide.  The studio is private, has a metal/double-door entrance.   Th=
e ceiling is 14' tall, and there is 2' of shared air up at the ceiling  abo=
ve the front wall to another space.  I needed to include this  airspace to =
aid with airflow.  The artists on the other side are  responsible, respectf=
ul people and I'm sure they would appreciate the  same from you.  We've nev=
er disrupted eachother.  The total square  footage of the studio is around =
500/sq ft., but that includes my  storage.  The working area you would have=
 access to is a large square,  little over 400 sq/ft.  <br /> <br /> 1717 T=
routman is a great studio building, with dozens of artists, and  several ar=
t galleries.  It also has a nice roof deck.  You may find  being in this co=
mmunity a good resource.  The building has a loading  dock, and freight ele=
vator as well.  <br /> <br /> I request the two months at $530/month (that =
includes electric assuming  there isn't a huge spike in electric usage) and=
 security deposit of  $300, for a total of $1,360 upfront.  The $300 securi=
ty deposit will be  returned when I receive the keys back, and my studio is=
 in good  condition, as I'll need to be back in my studio and working immed=
iately  upon my return.<br /><br /> <a style=3D"color: black;" shape=3D"rec=

30 per month, Kensington, Very Large Room, SPACIOUS & SUNNY BDRM  AVAILABLE=
 IN A GREAT 2 1/2 BDRM HOME<br /> Available: July 1, 2013 through June 2014=
<br /><br /> This share is a house: Bedrooms and the bathroom are located o=
n the  second floor; the entire first floor is common space: living room,  =
separate dining room, and a large kitchen (We can both live in the house  a=
nd feel as if we have our own space, at times). There is also a front  porc=
h and many built-in storage areas. You will be sharing the space  with only=
 one person (me!). Your room will be unfurnished (there is  however an IKEA=
 dresser that you can use or we can donate). <br /> <br /> Location: 2 bloc=
ks from the F/G line at Church Ave, walking distance to  the Post Office, F=
ood Town, Walgreens, Rite Aid and various restaurants.  It's also a block f=
rom the laundromat. Approximately two train stops  away from Park Slope and=
 10 Mins  Ditmas Park if you take the train or  bus. 15-20 minute walk to P=
rospect Park.<br /> <br /> The available room is very spacious and would co=
mfortably fit a Queen  bed set. It also has two windows and a large closet =
with two additional  shelves. The rent includes gas, electric, and water. W=
iFi is  approximately $30 per month per person. You would be required to si=
gn a  1-yr lease providing that you have proof of income and have evidence =
 that you pay your rent on time (e.g. letter from a recent landlord or  for=
mer roommate). First month's rent ($1030) and 1 month security ($900)  are =
required upon signing the lease.<br /> <br /> About you: Ability to pay ren=
t on time, willing to equally split  cleaning responsibilities on a rotatin=
g schedule and share in the cost  of commonly used household supplies ($10 =
a month), no live-in BF/GF  (this would be your home too, of course people =
can visit you!). No pets.  A non smoker. Someone who is interested in creat=
ing a home.<br /> <br /> About me: I work for a large community-based organ=
ization in Brooklyn.  In my spare time I love to read (mostly on the train =
to and from  places). I do yoga. I love to dance and listen music. I love A=
rts and  frequent museums. Love to walk in the park. I am hardly home but w=
hen  home love a space that is nurturing and calm. Everything I expect of  =
you.<br /> <br /> If you're interested, feel free to email me so that we ca=
n set up a time to talk. <br /> <br /> I look forward to hearing from you!<=

 loft located 3.5 blocks from the Morgan L train and  about 4 longer blocks=
 to the Jefferson L. If you are familiar with the  neighborhood, it has coo=

 grab drinks, get coffee, eat food. My home  is large and sunny, a corner u=
nit and we have views of the Manhattan  skyline.<br /> <br /> I am a female=
 in my mid twenties and I like to keep good, positive vibes  among roommate=

 email for a time to meet up!<br /> <br /> I will have two very different l=
ofted rooms available for July 1.<br /> <br /> The larger room 7.5'x21'Sqft=
 ($975)-- although it is lofted, there is a  staircase to get upstairs and =
there is a closet you can stand in.<br /> <br /> The smaller room roughly 8=
'x8'Sqft($650)-- Also lofted, with a smaller cutout area for clothing.<br /=
> Not a space that is optimal for individuals that want to spend extended t=
imes in their rooms.<br /> <br /> The communal space is really nice- the ro=
oms (especially the smaller  one) are ideal for people who will feel comfor=
table spending time in the  common areas. Both rooms are furnished with ful=
l sized beds.<br /> <br /> The rent does not include utilities or supplies =
(like toilet paper),  which we split 3 ways. 1st month and a deposit is req=
uired to move in. I  would like to commit with someone for July 1. Looking =
for roommates who  would like to stay for longer term (at least 6 months).<=

t. Greene 3-br<br /> Available: July 1 through November 1, maybe longer<br =
/><br /> Situation: We are a married couple in our mid-30s who spend most o=
f our  time upstate. We come into the city here and there for onsite work o=
r to  see friends. We are super quiet and courteous, artist/designers, clea=
n  nonsmokers with no drama. We've got a medium-sized puppy who usually  co=
mes down with us to the city. He's quiet and loves everyone.<br /> <br /> L=
ocation: Two short blocks from beautiful Fort Greene Park, and just a  bloc=
k or two's walk to a bunch of restaurants, bars, markets, drug  stores, lau=
ndromats, and coffee shops. Ten minute walk to B, D, R, Q, 2,  3, 4, 5, and=
 G. Also nearby: BAM, Pratt, the Brooklyn Flea, the Greene  Hill Food Co-op=
, etc. <br /> <br /> Apartment: Our place is a third-floor walkup in a 4-st=
ory prewar  building. It's a sort of dingy old building on a charming block=
 in a  great neighborhood. The neighbors are the one big drawback to the  a=
partment. We've got some frequently-noisy folks living next door and  above=
. It's unfortunate, but if you're willing to deal with that (as we  have fo=
r years now), the place is great. It's a good-sized apartment  with a spaci=
ous shared living room and average-sized kitchen and  bathroom.<br /> <br /=
> Rooms: The two rooms we are looking to rent are two completely separate  =
bedrooms on either side of the living room and bath. One is larger: 11 x  1=
2', with two windows that look out onto the street and get lots of  light. =
The second room is 9x10' and has a full-sized window that looks  out onto a=
n atrium. It actually gets a decent amount of light, too. <br /> <br /> You=
: Ideally, we'd like to find one person to rent both rooms - the  smaller o=
ne would be great for an artist's studio, home office, etc.  You'd have the=
 place to yourself most of the time. We are looking for  someone amiable, c=
lean, and courteous to keep the apartment in good  shape. The rent is $1425=
 for both rooms (includes heat and hot water).  Internet, gas, and electric=
 are extra.<br /><br /> <a style=3D"color: black;" shape=3D"rect" href=3D"h=

 be an easier commute to almost anywhere,  we're the bedford L stop or the =
marcy JMZ, many buses stop nearby, it's  easy bike territory, and if you ha=

od, and always getting moreso.<br /> <br /> so, VERY high ceilings througho=
ut (old warehouse style), big living room  split into 2 'areas', extra dini=
ng nook in kitchen, 1 bathroom, 5  separate bedrooms. your room is a decent=
 size, not huge but definitely  not small (especially by this area's standa=
rds, which are ridiculous).  there's a very well placed loft (hardly any ov=
erhang in the VERY tall  room) that's generally used as a sleeping loft wit=
h some space for  shelves or storage. it's an internal room with a wall of =
windows to the  living room, which has a wall of windows. <br /> <br /> thi=
s loft has a very friendly, arty, respectful & loving vibe. fyi  this is NO=
T a new construction new williamsburg apt, it's a proper loft  with all the=
 old warehouse crap intact.  at home we clean up after  ourselves, we're ha=
ppy to see each other when we do but occasionally go  days at a time withou=
t seeing anyone, and we're very  active/busy/creative people. we do NOT bri=
ng the party home, ever,  except the occasional dinner party we're all invo=
lved in. this is not a  williamsburg pad to get wild in. we're 30-40, it's =
a chill creative  adult house.  no live-in significant others, occasional g=

 years, as a  newby, all cards on the table, you'd be paying more than us. =
that was a  hard decision but it seems fair and neighborhood appropriate, a=
nd we've  built this cozy castle over many years... and this would let us s=
tay in  it for the final year of our lease. then either they'll raise it mo=

50 per month, Carroll Gardens/Gowanus, Seeking lovely roommate for super sp=
acious apartment<br /> Available: July 1, 2013 through June 30, 2014<br /><=
br /> THINGS IT HAS:<br /> - ceiling fans, lights<br /> - nice hardwood flo=
ors<br /> - closets, new cabinets<br /> - new sink & fridge, old oven<br />=
 - heat & hot water<br /> - places for window AC units<br /> - spitting dis=
tance from F, G, R<br /> - surprising amount of natural light<br /> - lots =
and lots and lots of space<br /> - pepto bismal pink and purple walls<br />=
 <br /> THINGS IT NEEDS:<br /> - potentially newly painted walls<br /> - a =
lovely roommate<br /> <br /> Hello! I just locked down a wonderful three be=
droom apartment in the  Carroll Gardens/Gowanus area and I'm looking for a =
roommate to fill one  of the other rooms. The apartment is ridiculously spa=
cious with tons of  light, aside from a slightly cramped bathroom, and is l=
ocated on Bond  Street between Union and Sackett. <br /> <br /> I'm 22, fem=
ale, with a job in DUMBO working for a lecture series. I'm  meticulously cl=
ean, love internet, bad at cooking, like cheese, ice  cream, books, and run=
 occasionally. You're relatively clean, also  employed, and are okay splitt=
ing the utilities, wifi, and sharing other  mutual expenses. You also don't=
 have pets, preferably don't smoke.<br /> <br /> Rent is $2500, so $1250 sp=
lit, not including utilities and such. The  room for rent is your pick, pin=
k or purple (I'm shooting for a pink one,  there's two), in a three bedroom=
 apartment, available as soon as July  1st for a year or less.<br /> <br />=
 If this sounds even mildly appealing, feel free to send me an email with  =
a little bit about yourself and we can meet up for a beverage of some  sort=
.<br /> <br /> <br /> Best,<br /> Carly<br /><br /> <a style=3D"color: blac=

00 per month, Brooklyn - Vinegar Hill, true one-bedroom apt, whole place to=
 yourself, a bike commuter's dream!<br /> Available: 6/28/13 through 7/27/1=
3<br /><br /> My full one-bedroom apartment is available for a month (end o=
f June  through end of July--dates could be slightly flexible). It's on the=
 edge  of Vinegar Hill in Brooklyn, just one block from the Manhattan Bridg=
e  bike ramp. <br /> <br /> This means that the cobblestone streets of Dumb=
o and its galleries,  boutiques, cafes, and bars are all within a 5-10 minu=
te walk. The lovely  water-side Brooklyn Bridge Park (best skyline views of=
 Manhattan!) with  Sunday farmer's market and Jane's carousel are right the=
re too. Explore  the area by Citibike bicycle share--there's a station one =
block from my  front door. The close-by subways take me to my Midtown Manha=
ttan office  in 25-30 minutes, door to door.<br /> <br /> By bike:<br /> 15=
 minutes to the Lower East Side<br /> 20 minutes to Williamsburg<br /> 30 m=
inutes to Midtown<br /> 20 minutes to Pratt<br /> 15 minutes to Fort Greene=
 Park<br /> <br /> By foot:<br /> 4 minutes to York St. F station<br /> 4 m=
inutes to High St. A/C station<br /> 5 minutes to Dumbo<br /> 10 minutes to=
 Brooklyn Bridge<br /> 20 minutes to Brooklyn Heights<br /> <br /> The apar=
tment is cozy, with a queen size bed, air conditioner in the  bedroom, happ=
y plants on the living room window sill, and a gorgeous  newly renovated ki=
tchen. No TV! But wifi. <br /> <br /> No need to lock your bike on the stre=
et, bring it up in the elevator,  and right into the apartment. Or if you o=
wn a car or like to take cabs,  the BQE, Manhattan Bridge, and Brooklyn Bri=
dge on-ramps are all within a  few blocks. The building has two elevators a=
nd a 24 hour doorman (who  only speaks Chinese though). <br /> <br /> Full =
disclosure caveats! The common areas of the building aren't what  one might=
 call pristine (your midwestern parents might be put off by the  incense, s=
lippers, and granny carts in front of my neighbors' doors)  and the BQE is =
close-by and audible (the traffic creates a white noise  effect). <br /> <b=

00 per month, Manhattan, Last-minute change in circumstances left a good gu=
y in a tight spot<br /> Available: July 1st<br /><br /> Hi all-<br /> I'm h=
oping the expression 'when one door closes, another opens' can save  me fro=
m an exceptionally tight spot. After months of planning, my  former roommat=
e and close friend had a financial realization that forced  his hand into s=
igning a lease without consulting me first at the last  minute, leaving me =
without a place to live and no time to do the  standard roommate search bef=
ore my lease is up on June 30th.<br /> <br /> I am hoping beyond hope to fi=
nd a room or sublet or really whatever I can in Manhattan before this situa=
tion gets any more dire.<br /> <br /> I am a clean, responsible and respect=
ful young guy- a military brat who  has been forced to make the best of the=
 people around me my whole life,  and then pick up and start fresh. I'm eas=
y going, great sense of humor  and sane...there won't be any issues with un=
announced visitors or a  live-in significant other who suddenly doubles you=
r NYC apartment's  occupancy.<br /> <br /> I do not need a ton of space, no=
r furnishings (though I would be willing  to store my things if the opportu=
nity for a furnished place presents  itself). Ideally I would like to be cl=
ose to a subway, but beggars can't  be choosers. On my list when we were lo=
oking for places before, subway  and laundry were number one and two.<br />=
 <br /> Financial: I am financially responsible with good credit and gainfu=
l  employment. I am clean (as in use a coaster every time), and appreciate =
 open communication and mutual respect in my (your) home. I am open to  any=
one, and if there's a dish in the sink my reaction is to wash it  before I =
call a roommate meeting to find the source. <br /> <br /> Open to short and=
 long term, and flexible with payment on the usual fees  and bills so PLEAS=
E let me know if you know of anything that could help  me out.<br /> Thank =
