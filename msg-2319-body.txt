two of our beloved resources for all things art-related in New York City.
-Stephanie
"Last week I listened to Kathleen Gilrain recount the damage Hurricane Sand=
y inflicted
on Smack Mellon studios in Dumbo. The entire downstairs residency was flood=
ed with
six feet of water. Their media center, elevator, electricity and walls have=
 been
 all but destroyed. Gilrain, as she told the story, struggled to recount al=
l the
 details, as tears welled up in her eyes.
Many of the artists who have participated in shows, or been part of their r=
esidency
program use the Listings Project. We're part of a city wide community of ar=
tists
 and creative folks banned together by our investment in art making and as,=
 feel-good
as this may sound, belief in each other.
It's for this reason that I was especially excited when Gilrain told me tha=
t if=20
they could raise enough money to fix their electricity, they'd be able to r=
eopen
 their space. Those costs will run between 11,000-and 15,000, which is a lo=
t, but
I told Gilrain I thought we could help her raise at least half that money t=
hrough
the Art Fag City wienerfest December 16th. In turn, a grant offered by the =
ADAA=20
will match the funds we raise dollar for dollar, to $5000. In short, if we,=
 at Art
Fag City can raise, 6,000, Smack Mellon will be able to reopen their doors.=
 That's
something to celebrate!"

$200 per month, Clinton Hill/ Fort Greene/ Navy Yards, 180 SF., Great Inexp=
ensive
Studio Share in Clinton Hill
Available: immediately through Open
An artist/photographer is looking to share a studio space in Clinton  Hill.=
 The=20
studio is a bright, newly renovated space 10.5 ft x 14.5 ft  with 12 ft cei=
lings
 and two large windows. There is a 5 x 6 foot  entrance area with overhead =
loft=20
for storage of large pieces and and a  shelf for smaller storage. The space=
 is well
laid out and there should  be just enough room for two.
This space would be ideal for someone who works mostly on the computer  or =
works
 small. Another photographer/artist would be ideal, but I'm open  to other,=
 non-messy
disciplines. I use the space mostly to edit, print,  view and store work. I=
'm in
 the studio about 4 of the 5 days,  Monday-Friday 10 am - 5 or 6 pm. I'm lo=
oking
 for someone with an  opposite schedule who'll use the space primarily on e=
venings
and  weekends, though some shared time could work. There is just enough roo=
m  for
two people to work at the same time, but it's not a huge space, so  an oppo=
site=20
schedule would be best. There is some storage and some  additional storage =
can be
built.
I'd like to keep an open, uncluttered space and am looking for someone  who=
 wants
the same. The studio is equipped with a 4x6 foot work table, a  16 foot vie=
wing=20
wall. There is a long desk with enough space for two  work stations. There =
is a=20
plan to get a large format Epson printer, but  if you already have one, all=
 the=20
better. Otherwise, the space comes  furnished.
The building has a huge freight elevator, passenger elevator, loading  dock=
, 24/7
access, and lots of artist studios. Wi-Fi is included. There  is a small fe=
e for
 additional electric use during winter and summer  months.

some privacy. So far the space has worked out  well for working people who =
care=20
about their commute time and need a  solid pad to come home to. Please cont=
act me
if interested and tell me  something about yourself.

$700 per month, Bedford Stuyvesant, Small Room + Shared Space in Large Dupl=
ex, Room
in Queer Housing Cooperative
Available: Dec 15 or Jan 1 through 1 year
We are three women who have been collaborating to start a new  cooperative =
home,
 and we're looking for a fourth housemate/collaborator!
In November, we moved into the top two floors of an amazing brownstone  in =
Bed Stuy.
The lower floor has large common spaces (kitchen, dining  room, and living =
room),
one bedroom, and laundry; the upper floor has  three bedrooms, and a small =
room=20
that we've repurposed as a  yoga/meditation/stretching space. The available=
 bedroom
is the smallest  of the bedrooms: it's about 6'x 12.5' and has a window and=
 closet.
 Because of the size (twin bed would be best), we are asking a lower rent  =
than=20
the other rooms ($700/month + electricity + cooking gas). While  the room i=
s small,
the common rooms are flexible spaces for eating,  reading, thinking, workin=
g, making,
and watching movies every now and  again.
As a household, we share food and supplies, and we cook a weekly meal  toge=
ther.
 We also have a system for sharing in maintaining a clean, warm  home, and =
we have
regular house meetings. Generally, we're looking for  ways to create a supp=
ortive
community that will enrich our individual  and collective experience of our=
 home
 and time together.
Things we're into that you might be too:
* Goals, aspirations, or professions that can be enhanced through a coopera=
tive=20
living arrangement
* Some flavor of queer sexual or gendered identity, practice, expression, p=
erformance
* Feminist or womanist as a way to empower ourselves and others
* Antiracist, anti-imperialist, and all around anti-oppressive
* Constructive listeners and flexible communicators
* Class-conscious
* Spiritually rooted and mindful
* Openhearted and generous
* Interested in sustainable food practices
* Dabblers and aficionados of alternative health practices (reiki, acupunct=
ure,=20
yoga, homeopathic medicine, etc.)
* Tinkers and hacks at art-making / idea-making / thing-making
* Community/civic-minded as matter of course
Some caveats:
* We already have three cats and aren't looking to add more cats/dogs
* Smokers are okay, but must smoke outside the house
* We need first months' rent, a deposit, and share of brokers fee to  move =
in (totaling
around $2,700) -- we're open to how and when that's  paid.  For us, this is=
 part
 of everyone in the co-op having equal share  in all aspects of the home.
* Ideally seeking a one-year commitment, and need to provide two reference =
letters
& proof of income
More about us > Amara, a woman of color, small-business owner, and  aspirin=

$850 per month, Park Slope, 12 X 8 1/2, Beautiful small sunny room in newly=
 renovated
Park Slop apt.
Available: Jan 1, 2013 through open  ended
Room is in the 2nd floor apartment of a two story house near 12th Street  a=
nd  7th
Avenue, Park Slope. It is 12 X 8 =BD, has a window overlooking a  garden, i=
s sun-filled
and very quiet.  Rent is $850.00 per month, W-Fi  included. Utilities are $=
30.00
 per month.
The room is big enough for a queen size bed, dresser and chair..or a  twin =
bed which
then allows room for a small desk as well.  There is a  clothes closet with=
 a storage
shelf in the private upstairs landing  which would be for the exclusive use=
 of the
roommate. There is also room  for storing a bicycle in an empty space adjoi=
ning=20
the stairwell.  The  room is being rented unfurnished, however I would be w=
illing
to consider  putting some furniture in it. I have a queen or twin size airb=
ed that
I  can provide temporarily, but it would not be a long term solution...thes=
e  beds
tend to leak air after long term use.
The apartment itself is 600 sf and is newly renovated, with an all new  kit=
chen,
 bathroom, refinished hardwood floors, and beautiful new paint  job. It is =
two small
flights up from street level.
Although the apartment is a one bedroom, I am using it as a two bedroom  (t=
he "living
room being the 2nd bedroom"). The bedrooms are private,  with doors, and si=
tuated
on either side of the large kitchen which  includes a small common area wit=
h a table
and chairs.  The entrance to  the apartment opens into the kitchen.
Re the Kitchen: It is dream for someone who likes to cook..brand new 5  bur=
ner range
and stove, giant new refrigerator, and new very spacious  cabinets. It is f=
ully=20
outfitted with kitchen stuff like dishes, pots,  pans, knives, forks, cups,=
 bowls,
blender, toaster, etc.,  and a  cappuccino machine.
The bathroom is shared and is situated one window away from the room for  r=
ent,=20
so is very convenient for a roommate. The bathroom also has a  window and g=
ets lots
of light, and has a very large bathtub and shower.
The apartment is also home to two friendly cats. You can bring your own  ca=
t if=20
you want, but we would have to discuss the logistics.
Note:* The apartment and entire building is a No-Smoking environment. If yo=
u smoke,
then I would ask that you do it outside.
About me:
Photographer, male, 70's, work in the arts, hang out with artists and  acad=
emics.
Spend very little time at home, mostly working in my studio,  or out with f=
riends.
When I'm home I like the space to be a respite from  the somewhat hectic li=
fe I=20
lead outside of it, and would hope that a  roommate would have that same fe=
eling
 about their living space.
About you:
Somehow connected to the arts, who has a job and can pay the rent on  time,=
 reasonably
neat, considerate of others, done with your partying  days, or if not, at l=
east=20
not into bringing the party home.
It would be nice if we had enough in common so that when we pass each  othe=
r coming
in or out, or are in the commons space, we might engage in  some interestin=
g bits
of conversation, but that would be a plus, not a  necessity.
The neighborhood is full of great restaurants, bars, cafes, shops of  every=
 description,
Park Slope Coop and other food stores, & many  laundromats, Zipcar garage d=
own the
street, F & B trains a block  away, and the R a five minute walk; Two block=
s from
the 5th Ave bus  line, =BD block from the 7th Ave bus line, 4 blocks to a Y=
MCA with
a great  pool, and Yoga all over the place.
Room is available starting Jan 1, 2013. First month's rent in advance plus =
one month's
rent as Security Deposit to move in.

Hello everyone, I finally found a great apartment and I'm looking for  some=
one to
share it with. It's on the second floor of a beautiful  pre-war building. L=
ocated
in the lovely neighborhood of Prospect  Heights, it's right by Tom's (famou=
s old
 school diner) and down the  street from the Brooklyn Museum/Library/Botani=
cal Gardens/Prospect
Park.  The apartment is in great shape (was recently renovated)--no laundry=
,  but
yes dishwasher! The friendly super, conveniently, lives in the  building. T=
he closest

n Ave.
A bit about me: I'm a 24-year-old artist who paints portraits and  communit=
y murals.
I'm kind, responsible, and easy to get along with. I'm  social, but not a b=
ig partier,
and I need my alone time. I care about  the aesthetics of my living space (=
currently
furnishing/decorating). I  love art, dance, hip-hop, food, history, and tra=
vel.=20
Ideally, you're  around the same age and we share an interest or two. I wou=
ld enjoy
 getting to know the right roommate. You must be a financially stable,  cle=
an, sane,
low key, non-smoker. If this sounds right for you, email me  with something=
 about
yourself and we can talk details!

$965 per month, Brooklyn, 10 x 13, Room available off Jefferson L
Available: December 2012 through Open
Hi!
I am looking for a roommate for my apartment off the Jefferson L in  Bushwi=
ck, Brooklyn.
The available room is 10 x 13 and has a big window  that lets in light and =
faces
 the courtyard. It's unfurnished and at the  opposite end of the apartment =
from=20
my room, so there is definitely  privacy. The apartment itself is quite spa=
cious
 with a lot of natural  light. This neighborhood is great because it's righ=
t by=20
the park and  there are tons of awesome new spots opening up here like Tand=
em, Pearls,
 and Heaven Street. Move-in is flexible- I'd like to find someone ASAP  alt=
hough
 almost any time starting in December is fine. Short-term or  long-term is =
also=20
fine although I prefer at least three months. The  utilities usually averag=
e about
60/mo. One-month security deposit.
I'd like to try to find someone I have something in common with who  would =
be a=20
good match for the apartment. I'm a female singer/musician  and performance=
 artist
and I work in high-end retail in the city. I'm in  my mid-twenties and woul=
d like
to find someone around the same age. I'm  very focused on my work so it's i=
mportant
to me to find someone who  respects that kind of thing. I'm obsessed with b=
ands=20
(noise, punk,  hardcore, post-punk, shoegaze, and classical). My favorites:=
 My Bloody
 Valentine, Minor Threat, Smashing Pumpkins, Interpol, Cocteau Twins.  Also=
 into
 fashion (Rodarte, Comme des Garcons, JW Anderson).
I want to maintain the aesthetic that is already in the apartment. I'm  sup=
er clean
so if you're also into cleanliness- like sharing cleaning up  once a week o=
r something
and helping with taking out trash and  recycling- that's fantastic. No 420 =
or super
heavy  drinkers/smokers/druggers please. Looking for someone fun and peacef=
ul  who'd
also be into having a friendly roommate tea/hot  chocolate/chit-chat now an=
d then.
Tell me about yourself, what music  you're into, what you're into otherwise=
, and
 your lifestyle. I can email  more pictures if you want.
Thanks and let me know if you want to come check it out!

responsible... A visiting artist or other sort of  professional or traveler=
, all
 would be welcome.
So I'm subletting out my big extra room for December/January and  potential=
ly a=20
bit longer (exact dates are negotiable, though I am  looking to rent the ro=
om ASAP).
The room is big, maybe 18x14 feet with nice tall ceilings.
2 windows overlooking a dead end street, 2nd floor.
2 cats live here, so allergic types wouldn't be a good match.
I can provide a bed, some shelving and a closet, though the closet is in a =
separate
room.
The apt is a spacious railroad, and this room is the nicer, brighter,  bigg=
er of
 the 2. Separate entrances allow for privacy. Friendly  neighbors. Laundrom=
at down
the block.
The neighborhood (Ridgewood) is safe, extremely convenient, kind of a  fami=
ly feel.
The M train connects easily and quickly to the L and J  trains. About a 25 =
minute
(mostly elevated) ride to W.4th in Manhattan.  There are a few excellent fr=
esh produce
markets and groceries down the  block, along with your choice of pharmacies=
, eateries,
salons, hardware  stores, a cute little post office, a local fish market an=
d tons
of  Polish delis. Italian too, and a pretty good Greek cafe on the corner.
I'll include pictures I took while moving in and painting so you have a  se=
nse of
the place, but will have to include better images of the room  itself as so=
on as
 I have time.
Please don't hesitate to be in touch! And if you'd be interested in  rentin=
g out
 this space as an art studio for less $$, I'd definitely be  open to that a=
s well.

Our building houses eight live/work spaces with a range of visual  artists =
(painting,
photography, sculpture, etc.) and writers. We are not  a collective but are=
 looking
for an environment where dedicated artists  can have space and comfort to c=
reate.
Everyone works different  schedules, and each have similar large, private s=
paces.
This is a quiet  place shared by working artists in their 30's and early 40=
's.
Rent is $950/month and includes utilities and internet (we require 1  month=
 security
deposit). Visual artists only (no musicians), cat's are  ok.

I'm looking for a six-month subletter Jan 1 - Jun 1 (start and end dates  s=

 with
 great light, a small office, and a third room which  I'm just using for st=
orage.
The 2 bedrooms are on opposite ends of the  apartment, so you have as much =
privacy
or social-ness as you want. The  rest of the apartment (living room, kitche=
n) is
 good-sized and recently  renovated.
My roommate is a 34-year-old guy, laid-back and responsible. He builds  fur=
niture
and works 4 nights a week waiting tables, so is usually out of  the apartme=
nt Thu
- Sun evenings.
The apartment is a few minutes' walk from the 2,3,4,5 trains at the  Frankl=
in Ave
stop, as well as the C train Franklin Ave stop. Close to  many bars, coffee=
 shops,
restaurants, museums, and Prospect Park. I've  lived in the neighborhood fo=
r four
years, and like the area a lot.
I'm taking a six-month gig in the Midwest, and there's a chance that  this =
sublet
could extend for an entire year if you're interested.  Steadily-employed, r=
esponsible,
no-drama people only, please.

We are subletting our excellent 3-bedroom furnished apartment for the  mont=

January while we go on residencies. The dates are January 1-31,  but we mig=

This is a bright, colorful artist's apartment in Carroll Gardens close  to =
everything.
The apartment is on a pretty, tree-lined street a block  and a half away fr=
om the
F and G subway at Carroll, near all the  restaurants, shops, and nightlife =
of Smith
Street, and two blocks from  all the delicious Italian shops on Court Stree=
t. This
neighborhood is in  the heart of Brownstone Brooklyn, and just four stops f=
rom Manhattan
on  the subway. Williamsburg and North Brooklyn are convenient on the G  tr=
ain.
The apartment has wood floors, bright colors on the walls, and plenty of  h=
eat.=20
It's very roomy, with good light. There are two bedrooms with  beds -- one =
queen
 and one full. We also have a utility room and office  with a full-size tem=
purpedic
inflatable bed. The apartment will  comfortably sleep three, or six if you'=
re sharing
beds. To be clear,  this is a three-bedroom apartment; only two of us live =
here.
 We are  renting out the entire apartment -- it's yours for the month.
We have a nice cooking kitchen with lots of space. We cook all the time,  s=
o you'll
find all sorts of pots, pans, spices, and oils. We have one  bathroom with =
a full-size
tub. Your rental price includes high-speed  wireless internet. We also have=
 a television

We are on the third floor of a four-floor walk-up. There are 16 units in  o=
ur building.
Our neighbors are neighbors -- you know they're there --  but our walls are=
 thick.
I have lived here for 12 years, and the  building is very safe.
This is a great apartment.

$2000 per month, Lower East Side, 570 square feet, Sweet, cozy apartment in=
 heart
of Lower East Side
Available: Dec 13 through Jan 15
Hello! My name is Sarah and I am renting out my apartment from Dec. 13  unt=
il Jan
15. I am currently a PhD student and will be traveling in  China to work on=
 my research
so I want someone to be able to enjoy and  respect the space while I am gon=
e. The
apartment is actually a two  bedroom but one of the bedrooms I will use to =
store
 my things.  Otherwise, you will have full access to the rest of the apartm=
ent,=20
which  includes kitchen, living room and bathroom.
The area is fantastic: I live in the heart of the Lower East Side  amongst =
loads
 of restaurants and bars. I am also a 5-10 minute walk to  SOHO, the East V=
illage
and Chinatown, as well as 1 subway stop to  Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
Although the intersection is well-traveled, I am not facing the street  so =
the apartment
is very quiet. My main subway stop is 2nd Avenue (F),  although it is nearl=
y equidistant
to Delancey/Essex stop as well  (M,F,J). This makes it convenient to most l=
ocations
in Manhattan as   well as Brooklyn (Williamsburg is only one stop away).
Technical tidbits: This place is perfect for couples. Please, no more  than=
 2 people.
The rent includes all utilities and the dates may  be  somewhat  flexible.

$500 per week, Crown Heights / Prospect Heights, 600 square feet,  Wonderfu=
l bright,
2 boxed-bedroom, top floor, pre-war apartment!

ubletting
our sunny, pre-war apartment for while in Europe for the  winter holidays.
It is fully furnished with two boxed bedrooms a central living room,  nice =
kitchen
and bath room with tub. The larger bedroom has a  queen-sized bed (mattress=
) and
 the other room has the possibility to  sleep 2 on guest foldaway futons. T=
he apartment
is on the top floor,  with windows in all rooms. It is located on the borde=
r between
Crown  Heights and Prospect Heights in a great neighborhood, 2 minutes from=
  Brooklyn
Museum, the Botanical Garden and Prospect Park. - On a quiet  block around =
the corner
from old and new cafes, bars and great  restaurants (New American, Mexican,=
 Japanese,
Caribbean and more).
We pay $2.000 a month including utilities, and just hope to break even,  so=
 we are
asking $500 per week - so $1.350 for the full period from  December 18 - Ja=
nuary
 6.
The move in date can be before December 18. In that case it would be a  $35=
 per=20
day share with our current wonderful roommate who lives in the  smaller roo=
m.
Because of the layout, it is great for couples, to share or for a small fam=
ily.
We'd prefer to rent it out for the whole period, but are flexible, and  are=
 looking
for someone responsible and respectful to take care of our  home while we a=
re away.
Please See attached photos (from this summer)!
Best wishes from Reykjavik,
Theresa and Kristjan

I need a new place to live in mid-January. I'm open to most  neighborhoods =
in Brooklyn,
Manhattan or Queens, but need to be shooting  distance from downtown Manhat=

and would like to pay 600-800/month.
Some things about myself: 24 year-old male, clean, respectful and  independ=

I don't have much in the way of stuff to move in with, work  full-time, and=
 have
 no pets (I like animals, but am, unfortunately,  allergic to some cats). I=
 like
 talking and cooking, and although I do  spend a lot of time out of the hou=
se, I
 appreciate a relaxed and  comfortable environment at home.
Some more things about me: I work at a letterpress printshop in downtown  N=
Y, which
I love. I also love hiking, biking and running (i just did my  first big bi=
ke tour
this year in the Pacific Northwest), art and a wide  range of music. I have=
 a background
in architecture and sustainable  design, printmaking, typography and graphi=
cs, and
am also an amateur  baker.
Email me if you have any questions, or want to talk about it!

Affected by Sandy Bring Back Sunny's Bar, Donate to help re-build favorite =
Red Hook
spot flooded by Sandy
Hi friends. Over the years, many of you have made the journey from near and=
 far=20
to be with us. You've shared with us your creativity, talent, stories and s=
pirit.
In return, we've done what we can to make a place for you. Many of you are =
artists,
writers and musicians who have helped to make Sunny's a creative hub and me=
eting
 place for talents of all kinds. As Sunny would be the first to tell you, "=
This=20
is not My place, this is Ours!"
During the hurricane, water filled the entire basement that houses all of t=
he mechanical
systems for the building. Water also came into the 1st floor of the bar and=
 rose
 2 feet, causing buckled floors and ruining many musical instruments and a =
lot of
our sound equipment. We are only now, weeks after the hurricane, finally at=
 the=20
point where we can realistically tally up all of the damage.
Sunny's Bar has faced many challenges over the years. These hurdles have on=
ly been
overcome with the help and friendship of the incredible community of Red Ho=
ok. It's
amazing how many highly-skilled craftsman call this neighborhood home!  We =
are so
lucky to have the love and support of so many wonderful friends and neighbo=
rs here
in Brooklyn and beyond.
We truly believe that Sunny's belongs to all of us, and we will re-open. By=
 pledging
to rebuild Sunny's, you'll not only be investing in our future, but also in=
vesting
in the future of more wonderful, magical nights. Nights of music and art, l=
aughter
and kindness.
With much love and gratitude,
Sunny, Tone, Francis, Izzy, Chris T. and Chris P.

ie<br /><br />"Last week I listened to Kathleen Gilrain recount the damage =
Hurricane Sandy inflicted on Smack Mellon studios in Dumbo. The entire down=
stairs residency was flooded with six feet of water. Their media center, el=
evator, electricity and walls have been all but destroyed. Gilrain, as she =
told the story, struggled to recount all the details, as tears welled up in=
 her eyes. <br /><br />Many of the artists who have participated in shows, =
or been part of their residency program use the Listings Project. We're par=
t of a city wide community of artists and creative folks banned together by=
 our investment in art making and as, feel-good as this may sound, belief i=
n each other. <br /><br />It's for this reason that I was especially excite=
d when Gilrain told me that if they could raise enough money to fix their e=
lectricity, they'd be able to reopen their space. Those costs will run betw=
een 11,000-and 15,000, which is a lot, but I told Gilrain I thought we coul=
d help her raise at least half that money through the Art Fag City wienerfe=
st December 16th. In turn, a grant offered by the ADAA will match the funds=
 we raise dollar for dollar, to $5000. In short, if we, at Art Fag City can=
 raise, 6,000, Smack Mellon will be able to reopen their doors. That's some=
thing to celebrate!"<br /><br />-Paddy Johnson<br />Art Fag City <br /><br =

ive Studio Share in Clinton Hill<br /> Available: immediately through Open<=
br /><br /> An artist/photographer is looking to share a studio space in Cl=
inton  Hill. The studio is a bright, newly renovated space 10.5 ft x 14.5 f=
t  with 12 ft ceilings and two large windows. There is a 5 x 6 foot  entran=
ce area with overhead loft for storage of large pieces and and a  shelf for=
 smaller storage. The space is well laid out and there should  be just enou=
gh room for two.<br /> <br /> This space would be ideal for someone who wor=
ks mostly on the computer  or works small. Another photographer/artist woul=
d be ideal, but I'm open  to other, non-messy disciplines. I use the space =
mostly to edit, print,  view and store work. I'm in the studio about 4 of t=
he 5 days,  Monday-Friday 10 am - 5 or 6 pm. I'm looking for someone with a=
n  opposite schedule who'll use the space primarily on evenings and  weeken=
ds, though some shared time could work. There is just enough room  for two =
people to work at the same time, but it's not a huge space, so  an opposite=
 schedule would be best. There is some storage and some  additional storage=
 can be built.  <br /> <br /> I'd like to keep an open, uncluttered space a=
nd am looking for someone  who wants the same. The studio is equipped with =
a 4x6 foot work table, a  16 foot viewing wall. There is a long desk with e=
nough space for two  work stations. There is a plan to get a large format E=
pson printer, but  if you already have one, all the better. Otherwise, the =
space comes  furnished.<br /> <br /> The building has a huge freight elevat=
or, passenger elevator, loading  dock, 24/7 access, and lots of artist stud=
ios. Wi-Fi is included. There  is a small fee for additional electric use d=
uring winter and summer  months.<br /><br /> <a style=3D"color: black;" sha=

 couch area when I am  out. The bedroom is fully furnished with a bed, shee=

elves and an  extra large closet. I am on the second floor facing a general=

but plenty of Laundromats around the corner, as well as 2 major subway  sto=
ps, supermarket and lots of cool restaurants and bars. Best part is  only b=

lities. The room is available for short or long term.<br /><br /> <a style=

size (twin bed would be best), we are asking a lower rent  than the other r=

e common rooms are flexible spaces for eating,  reading, thinking, working,=
 making, and watching movies every now and  again.<br /> <br /> As a househ=

0 per month, Park Slope, 12 X 8 1/2, Beautiful small sunny room in newly re=
novated Park Slop apt.<br /> Available: Jan 1, 2013 through open  ended<br =
/><br /> Room is in the 2nd floor apartment of a two story house near 12th =
Street  and  7th Avenue, Park Slope. It is 12 X 8 =BD, has a window overloo=
king a  garden, is sun-filled and very quiet.  Rent is $850.00 per month, W=
-Fi  included. Utilities are $30.00 per month. <br /> <br /> The room is bi=
g enough for a queen size bed, dresser and chair..or a  twin bed which then=
 allows room for a small desk as well.  There is a  clothes closet with a s=
torage shelf in the private upstairs landing  which would be for the exclus=
ive use of the roommate. There is also room  for storing a bicycle in an em=
pty space adjoining the stairwell.  The  room is being rented unfurnished, =
however I would be willing to consider  putting some furniture in it. I hav=
e a queen or twin size airbed that I  can provide temporarily, but it would=
 not be a long term solution...these  beds tend to leak air after long term=
 use.<br /> <br /> The apartment itself is 600 sf and is newly renovated, w=
ith an all new  kitchen, bathroom, refinished hardwood floors, and beautifu=
l new paint  job. It is two small flights up from street level. <br /> <br =
/> Although the apartment is a one bedroom, I am using it as a two bedroom =
 (the "living room being the 2nd bedroom"). The bedrooms are private,  with=
 doors, and situated on either side of the large kitchen which  includes a =
small common area with a table and chairs.  The entrance to  the apartment =
opens into the kitchen. <br /> <br /> Re the Kitchen: It is dream for someo=
ne who likes to cook..brand new 5  burner range and stove, giant new refrig=
erator, and new very spacious  cabinets. It is fully outfitted with kitchen=
 stuff like dishes, pots,  pans, knives, forks, cups, bowls, blender, toast=
er, etc.,  and a  cappuccino machine. <br /> <br /> The bathroom is shared =
and is situated one window away from the room for  rent, so is very conveni=
ent for a roommate. The bathroom also has a  window and gets lots of light,=
 and has a very large bathtub and shower.<br /> <br /> The apartment is als=
o home to two friendly cats. You can bring your own  cat if you want, but w=
e would have to discuss the logistics.<br /> <br /> Note:* The apartment an=
d entire building is a No-Smoking environment. If you smoke, then I would a=
sk that you do it outside. <br /> <br /> About me: <br /> Photographer, mal=
e, 70's, work in the arts, hang out with artists and  academics. Spend very=
 little time at home, mostly working in my studio,  or out with friends. Wh=
en I'm home I like the space to be a respite from  the somewhat hectic life=
 I lead outside of it, and would hope that a  roommate would have that same=
 feeling about their living space. <br /> <br /> About you:<br /> Somehow c=
onnected to the arts, who has a job and can pay the rent on  time, reasonab=
ly neat, considerate of others, done with your partying  days, or if not, a=
t least not into bringing the party home. <br /> <br /> It would be nice if=
 we had enough in common so that when we pass each  other coming in or out,=

!<br /> Available: January 1 (or earlier) through October 31, 2013<br /><br=
 /> Hello everyone, I finally found a great apartment and I'm looking for  =
someone to share it with. It's on the second floor of a beautiful  pre-war =
building. Located in the lovely neighborhood of Prospect  Heights, it's rig=
ht by Tom's (famous old school diner) and down the  street from the Brookly=
n Museum/Library/Botanical Gardens/Prospect Park.  The apartment is in grea=
t shape (was recently renovated)--no laundry,  but yes dishwasher! The frie=
ndly super, conveniently, lives in the  building. The closest train is the =
2/3 at Eastern Parkway, or the B/Q at  7th and the 4/5 Franklin Ave.<br /> =
<br /> A bit about me: I'm a 24-year-old artist who paints portraits and  c=
ommunity murals. I'm kind, responsible, and easy to get along with. I'm  so=
cial, but not a big partier, and I need my alone time. I care about  the ae=
sthetics of my living space (currently furnishing/decorating). I  love art,=
 dance, hip-hop, food, history, and travel. Ideally, you're  around the sam=
e age and we share an interest or two. I would enjoy  getting to know the r=
ight roommate. You must be a financially stable,  clean, sane, low key, non=
-smoker. If this sounds right for you, email me  with something about yours=
elf and we can talk details!<br /><br /> Local Transportation: 2,3,B,Q,4,5,=

5 per month, Brooklyn, 10 x 13, Room available off Jefferson L<br /> Availa=
ble: December 2012 through Open<br /><br /> Hi! <br /> I am looking for a r=
oommate for my apartment off the Jefferson L in  Bushwick, Brooklyn. The av=
ailable room is 10 x 13 and has a big window  that lets in light and faces =
the courtyard. It's unfurnished and at the  opposite end of the apartment f=
rom my room, so there is definitely  privacy. The apartment itself is quite=
 spacious with a lot of natural  light. This neighborhood is great because =
it's right by the park and  there are tons of awesome new spots opening up =
here like Tandem, Pearls,  and Heaven Street. Move-in is flexible- I'd like=
 to find someone ASAP  although almost any time starting in December is fin=
e. Short-term or  long-term is also fine although I prefer at least three m=
onths. The  utilities usually average about 60/mo. One-month security depos=
it.<br /> <br /> I'd like to try to find someone I have something in common=
 with who  would be a good match for the apartment. I'm a female singer/mus=
ician  and performance artist and I work in high-end retail in the city. I'=
m in  my mid-twenties and would like to find someone around the same age. I=
'm  very focused on my work so it's important to me to find someone who  re=
spects that kind of thing. I'm obsessed with bands (noise, punk,  hardcore,=
 post-punk, shoegaze, and classical). My favorites: My Bloody  Valentine, M=
inor Threat, Smashing Pumpkins, Interpol, Cocteau Twins.  Also into fashion=
 (Rodarte, Comme des Garcons, JW Anderson).<br /> <br /> I want to maintain=
 the aesthetic that is already in the apartment. I'm  super clean so if you=
're also into cleanliness- like sharing cleaning up  once a week or somethi=
ng and helping with taking out trash and  recycling- that's fantastic. No 4=
20 or super heavy  drinkers/smokers/druggers please. Looking for someone fu=
n and peaceful  who'd also be into having a friendly roommate tea/hot  choc=
olate/chit-chat now and then. Tell me about yourself, what music  you're in=
to, what you're into otherwise, and your lifestyle. I can email  more pictu=
res if you want. <br /> <br /> Thanks and let me know if you want to come c=
heck it out!<br /><br /> <a style=3D"color: black;" shape=3D"rect" href=3D"=

ough negotiable<br /><br /> I am looking to sublet 1 bedroom in a spacious =
3 bedroom apartment in  Bed-Stuy. The room has a large window and is very s=
unny, but not too  sunny. The room is fully furnished with a desk and queen=
-size bed. There  is a beautiful old built-in bureau and cabinets with funn=
y old glass  doors. Also, a large closet. And lots of books if you like boo=
ks.<br /> <br /> There is a very large sunny living room where each of us h=
ave desks. It  doesn't have bay windows but some people would call them bay=
 windows.  There's a lot of room to stretch out in the living room and musi=
c stuff  for listening to music.<br /> <br /> The kitchen has a dishwasher =
and all the other regular things that kitchens have. The bathroom has a bat=
htub.<br /> <br /> My two roommates are quiet respectful men in their early=
 twenties. We are all sympathetic to the arts.<br /> <br /> The apartment i=
s in a building on a tree lined street and the  neighborhood is subdued. Th=
ere are some decent restaurants around the  corner and a laundromat too. Th=
ere is a bus that stops right in front of  the apartment. 5 minute walk to =
the C, 10 minute walk to the A.<br /> <br /> I will be working on a movie d=
own South so I'll be out of town  indefinitely. The length of the sublet is=
 negotiable, but preferably at  least until March 1st. The cost of the room=
 is $800 plus utilities  (including internet) are about $20 in the winter. =
The move in date is  also negotiable but ideally somewhere between December=
 10th and December  15th.<br /> <br /> Send me an email if you are interest=
ed and tell me how long you would potentially want to sublet for.<br /><br =

ble<br /> Available: January 2013 through June 2013<br /><br /> We have an =
opening starting in January at our live/work building for one  person. The =
space could also be used as a stand-alone studio. <br /> <br /> It's a grea=
t building (we rent the top two floors), two blocks from the  J/M at Flushi=
ng Ave or a 15 min walk to the L at Morgan or Montrose Ave.  On Broadway so=
 there's bit of train noise and not the best light. The  current artist is =
a sculptor and photographer with a darkroom in part of  the space and you'd=
 be welcome to reconfigure to your needs. There is a  work sink, super tall=
 ceilings, and large windows. The space is 3 large  rooms - 8.5 x 14ft, 8.5=
 x 9.5ft, 12 x 16ft, connected, and is  completely private. The bathroom is=
 shared with 1 other person with a  space on the same floor.<br /> <br /> O=
ur building houses eight live/work spaces with a range of visual  artists (=
painting, photography, sculpture, etc.) and writers. We are not  a collecti=
ve but are looking for an environment where dedicated artists  can have spa=
ce and comfort to create. Everyone works different  schedules, and each hav=
e similar large, private spaces. This is a quiet  place shared by working a=
rtists in their 30's and early 40's.<br /> <br /> Rent is $950/month and in=
cludes utilities and internet (we require 1  month security deposit). Visua=
l artists only (no musicians), cat's are  ok.<br /><br /> <a style=3D"color=

 a six-month subletter Jan 1 - Jun 1 (start and end dates  somewhat flexibl=

reat light, a small office, and a third room which  I'm just using for stor=
age. The 2 bedrooms are on opposite ends of the  apartment, so you have as =
much privacy or social-ness as you want. The  rest of the apartment (living=
 room, kitchen) is good-sized and recently  renovated.<br /> <br /> My room=
mate is a 34-year-old guy, laid-back and responsible. He builds  furniture =
and works 4 nights a week waiting tables, so is usually out of  the apartme=
nt Thu - Sun evenings. <br /> <br /> The apartment is a few minutes' walk f=
rom the 2,3,4,5 trains at the  Franklin Ave stop, as well as the C train Fr=
anklin Ave stop. Close to  many bars, coffee shops, restaurants, museums, a=
nd Prospect Park. I've  lived in the neighborhood for four years, and like =
the area a lot.<br /> <br /> I'm taking a six-month gig in the Midwest, and=
 there's a chance that  this sublet could extend for an entire year if you'=

ork on my research so I want someone to be able to enjoy and  respect the s=
pace while I am gone. The apartment is actually a two  bedroom but one of t=
he bedrooms I will use to store my things.  Otherwise, you will have full a=
ccess to the rest of the apartment, which  includes kitchen, living room an=
d bathroom. <br /> <br /> The area is fantastic: I live in the heart of the=
 Lower East Side  amongst loads of restaurants and bars. I am also a 5-10 m=
inute walk to  SOHO, the East Village and Chinatown, as well as 1 subway st=
op to  Williamsburg, Brooklyn.<br /> <br /> Although the intersection is we=
ll-traveled, I am not facing the street  so the apartment is very quiet. My=
 main subway stop is 2nd Avenue (F),  although it is nearly equidistant to =
Delancey/Essex stop as well  (M,F,J). This makes it convenient to most loca=
tions in Manhattan as   well as Brooklyn (Williamsburg is only one stop awa=
y). <br /> <br /> Technical tidbits: This place is perfect for couples. Ple=
ase, no more  than 2 people. The rent includes all utilities and the dates =
may  be  somewhat  flexible.<br /><br /> <a style=3D"color: black;" shape=

g Back Sunny's Bar, Donate to help re-build favorite Red Hook spot flooded =
by Sandy<br /><br />Hi friends. Over the years, many of you have made the j=
ourney from near and far to be with us. You've shared with us your creativi=
ty, talent, stories and spirit. In return, we've done what we can to make a=
 place for you. Many of you are artists, writers and musicians who have hel=
ped to make Sunny's a creative hub and meeting place for talents of all kin=
ds. As Sunny would be the first to tell you, "This is not My place, this is=
 Ours!"<br /><br />During the hurricane, water filled the entire basement t=
hat houses all of the mechanical systems for the building. Water also came =
into the 1st floor of the bar and rose 2 feet, causing buckled floors and r=
uining many musical instruments and a lot of our sound equipment. We are on=
ly now, weeks after the hurricane, finally at the point where we can realis=
tically tally up all of the damage. <br /><br />Sunny's Bar has faced many =
challenges over the years. These hurdles have only been overcome with the h=
elp and friendship of the incredible community of Red Hook. It's amazing ho=
w many highly-skilled craftsman call this neighborhood home!&nbsp; We are s=
o lucky to have the love and support of so many wonderful friends and neigh=
bors here in Brooklyn and beyond.<br /><br />We truly believe that Sunny's =
belongs to all of us, and we will re-open. By pledging to rebuild Sunny's, =
you'll not only be investing in our future, but also investing in the futur=
e of more wonderful, magical nights. Nights of music and art, laughter and =
kindness.<br /><br />With much love and gratitude,<br />Sunny, Tone, Franci=
s, Izzy, Chris T. and Chris P.<br /><br />Donate to the Kickstarter <a styl=
