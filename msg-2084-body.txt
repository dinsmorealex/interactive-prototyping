Hello List-
Here are listings as of 10/10/12
Listings Project Story of the Week:

I was Su's landlord (see Listings Poject Story last week.)  She did, indeed=
, keep
telling me to join your list in order to find a new tenant when she moved o=
ut. =20
I finally did and met so many wonderful prospective tenants -- it was an em=
barrassment
of riches.  I found myself wishing I had many more apartments to rent out s=
o I wouldn't
have to turn anyone down.  We ended up with a wonderful tenant who just mov=
ed in
 on Monday.   Thank you!

Best wishes,

Alex

is a large elevator. It is a  mixed use building for businesses and artist =
residents
and it's very  well maintained.
It has a large window and lots of excellent electric lights. Although  the =
window
is large, there is no direct light. Utilities are included in  the $800 ren=

rtists
are very satisfied with the studio.
I'm hoping I will find another good tenant.

$1200 per month, Prospect Heights/Park Slope, 170 sf, Large, quiet bedroom =
in beautiful
apartment for single female
Available: 12/1/2012 through open
Hi there! My current roommate is moving to Manhattan so I have a  wonderful=
 BR available
in my 2BR in Prospect Heights. The apartment is a  floor-thru--only 2 other=
 apts
 in the building. We are on the 2nd floor.  The BR is large, with room for =
a double/queen
bed, desk, dresser,  nightstand etc. Decent closet. I installed built-in bo=
okshelves
which  you can remove if you wish but they are really convenient. 2 windows=
  overlooking
back garden.
The rest of the apartment consists of a LR space, dining or workspace,  and=
 a decent-sized,
separate kitchen with plenty of counter space and  cabinets. Great if you l=
ove to
cook!
The room for rent is unfurnished, so you will have to provide your own.  Th=
ere is
room for LR furniture as well. I currently have a sofa,  bookcase, coffee a=
nd end
tables, etc. All of my furniture is mid-century  modern and I would love to=
 find
 someone with the same taste. :)
I am a writer who teaches part time at Pratt (in the Writing and  Humanitie=
s programs)and
at CUNY-BMCC. I also work freelance as a  copyeditor for several well-known=
 book
 publishers. My schedule tends to  change, and I do spend a considerable am=
ount=20
of time working from home.  So, ideally, you will have a regular, full-time=
 day=20
job.
I am 40, clean, sane, responsible, outgoing and friendly, but like space  a=
nd quiet
time and will respect your need for the same. Non-smoker. I'm  not really a=
 neat
 freak, but do keep the place clean. I have a fat,  sweet, adorable cat nam=
ed Cecil.
Cat lovers and cat owners are welcome,   C is generally friendly to/toleran=
t of=20
other cats.
What else? This is a FANTASTIC neighborhood. Tree-lined, pretty,  convenien=
t to=20
everything. 5 minute walk to 2 at Bergen or Q at 7th ave.  Tons of great sh=
ops,=20
cafes, bars. 10 minutes walk to Ft Greene, 10  minutes to Park Slope.
Bonus: we have a really lovely, sweet landlord! :)
Please get in touch with a little about yourself if interested. I will  be =
happy
 to send you a bunch of photos! Thanks and happy searching.  Holly

$800 per month, Crown Heights, Large sunny bedroom in newly renovated 2 br,=
 utilities
included!
Available: November 1, 20120 through November 1, 2013
I've just signed a lease on a beautifully renovated 2 bedroom apartment  in=
 Crown
Heights, and am looking for a roommate for the second bedroom!  Move in dat=
e November
1. The apartment is a floor through, with a long,  narrow living room and k=
itchen;
bedrooms, however, are roomy and set  quite far apart, affording a nice mea=
sure=20
of privacy. The apartment is  on the second floor of a lovely brownstone bu=
ilding
on a quiet, adorable  block-long street called Virginia Place. It's a 5 min=
ute walk
to the 3  at Kingston, and a more ambitious one to the C at Kingston/Throop=
.
The available bedroom is large, and can fit a full bed, desk, and  dresser.=
 It features
a full closet, and has two windows which lead out  onto the fire escape ove=
rlooking
the backyard. The rest of the apartment  will be fully furnished (in a tast=
eful,
 antique-leaning style). And  lest I forget to mention the best part, all u=
tilities
except internet  are included! So you'll be paying a grand total of $815/mo=
nth.
I am: a 26 year old female, a native Brooklynite currently attending  grad =
school
full time, getting a Masters in Journalism. I'm out of the  house from 8 am=
 until
at least 6 pm daily, and when I'm home I'm usually  studying quietly. A fre=
elance
chef and food writer by trade, my  interests include gardening, organic/veg=
etarian
cooking, reading, old  records (blues/soul/the Stones), movies and bikeridi=
ng. I'm
a calm,  focused, but laid-back and often goofy person, and though I value =
my  personal
space/time, I do enjoy the occasional drink, movie, or meal  with the right=
 roomie.
You should be: impeccably neat and clean, financially responsible, and  dra=
ma-free.
You should pitch in regularly to keep common areas clean and  tidy, and do =
things
like take out the trash and recycling of your own  volition. You should be =
regularly
employed, or a full time student. You  must love, or at least like, cats, a=
s I have
two. It would be awesome if  we had some interests in common, too! No coupl=
es, pets,
or smokers,  please.
I will host an open house at the apartment to meet potential roommates  fro=
m 4-7
 pm THIS Sunday, October 14th and hope to choose someone by the  end of tha=
t day.
If interested in attending, please shoot me an email to  let me know. If yo=
u're=20
interested in the apartment but absolutely  cannot attend the open house, g=
et in
 touch and I will try to meet you  there at some other time. In the meantim=
e, I'd
love to start a dialogue  with interested applicants, so please drop me a l=
ine!

$75 per day, East Village 2nd Ave & 6th St., Couch in living room  rented b=
y the
 night, Twin bed in sunlit living room. WiFi, Land line, 2  cats & breakfas=
t included
Available: Nov through onward
This is a lovely place to come to a few nights a week (when needed) in  the=
 midst
of one of the nicest most convenient neighborhoods in  Manhattan. Not a pla=
ce to
 move into; the aptartment is more like staying  at your favorite aunts but=
 with
 a more comfortable couch (because its a  bed and not a couch). Perfect for=
 someone
who lives out of town but  needs a place to stay a few nights a week in the=
 city
 without the  responsibility of keeping it stocked or clean. I do expect a =
level
 of  neatness, as in I do not want to be putting away someones stuff or  cl=
eaning
up after anyone. But I will take care of keeping the apt clean,  breakfast =
dishes(all
cat care of course) and will stock the apt with  coffee tea etc.
I would describe the place as cluttered but neat, clean, airey (windows  on=
 all=20
sides) and spacious. I would like a person who needs to come to  the city s=
omewhere
between 6 - 12 or more nights a month, weeknights  preferred. I will consid=
er 2=20
people who want to "share" the opportunity;  meaning they would come at dif=
ferent
times.
I considered doing airbnb but I don't want a constant flow of different  pe=
ople=20
here and I would like to know the person or people who stay here.  I will n=
eed references
and will of course want to meet the person or  persons first.

$1375 per month, Park Slope, HUGE, 2 huge BRs for sublet in 4BR in PARK SLO=
PE brownstone
$1325 & $1375 ( Park Slope )
Available: Nov 4th through Dec 1
Hello all,
We are so excited to be moving into a gem of an apartment on Nov. 4th.  We =
have=20
2 bedrooms for sublet in a beautiful brownstone in ideal Park  Slope locati=
on on
 the corner of 5th & Prospect Place, next to Miriam  and ALL transportation=
 lines.
5 min walk to 2,3 at Bergen and the B,Q  at 7th ave. Atlantic center 10 min=
 walk.
MOVE IN date is SUNDAY Nov.  4th.
**Looking for 2 pet friendly singles or couples. We already have 1 super  f=
riendly
dog and 2 lovely cats. In search of kind, positive,  open-minded, creative,=
 community
oriented people to sublet rooms in our  gorgeous Park Slope home. The rooms=
 are=20
fairly identical that's why we  provided only one picture of the bedroom. T=
he entry
level bedroom is a 1  month sublet with potential to continue month to mont=
h (Ideally
we are  looking for an apt mate who is interested in at least a 6 month sta=
y). =20
The other huge bedroom for sublet is located on the 2nd floor of the  duple=
x apartment
and is only for 1 month till Dec 1. Apartment common  spaces will be furnis=
hed but
not the bedrooms for sublet.
A bit about Jenny and me (Dorna): we are late 20's/early 30's. We love  to =
cook,
 garden, and share our dreamy home with close friends hosting  dinner, gath=
erings,
movie nights etc... We keep the kitchen very tidy,  as well as the rest of =
the house,
although we aren't crazy about it but  taking off your shoes has proven to =
cut down
on the amount of dirt one  tracks in. Jenny has an amazing dog, Kaya, and o=
ur friends
who will be  taking the upstairs master bedroom Dec 1 will be bringing two =
fluffy,
 well-behaved cats. The apartment is huge and that's exciting. With that  s=
aid,=20
we all do share the common spaces and one shower so keeping the  common spa=
ces,=20
especially the kitchen and bathroom clean is extremely  important. One of u=
s is=20
a chef and others are really into cooking so  tidying up after cooking meal=
s is=20
imperative and lending a hand in  keeping the bathroom clean is too! Did we=
 mention
the dishwasher :) That  will help:) Both of us are involved in the burning =
man scene
in new  york and appreciate the openness and creativity of the people we've=
 met.
  Also, neither of us watch TV. We prefer to have the living room,  relaxin=
g, inspiring
and not centered around a television. But we do love  to watch movies here =
and there
and we have a fantastic projector we  love to use in the living room or for=
 backyard
movie parties. Ideally we  are hoping for other like-minded folks that are =
not really
into  watching TV but if you still like to have one, that's fine, we just  =
prefer
you hook in up in your massive lair :)
About the gem and the jewels :)
Beautiful huge 2 floor duplex in historic brownstone. 4 separate  bedrooms =
total-
2 tiny ones that we are taking and the other 2 are super  large and for sub=
let.=20
large sunny kitchen connected to a large sunny  dinning area. Separate livi=
ng room
and second living room on 2nd floor  used as a studio, 1 full bath (with ir=
on claw-foot
tub!) and another 1/2  bath on main floor near the living room and kitchen/=
dinning
area .  Backyard with fire pit, wooden porch AND lower patio. Entrance to y=
ard =20
is off the kitchen. Solid Oak spiral staircase. ****
Jewels: Kaya is a fluffy, 10 yr old blonde border Collie. She is very  well=
 behaved
and does NOT bark. Her mom, Jenny, career was in dog  trainer a few years b=
ack before
she came to NYC for Grad school in Fine  Art. Kaya prefers to sleep the day=
 away,
sniff things in the yard, nudge  at your elbow for petting and to look into=
 her=20
eyes and share a  thousand I love you's and she likes to go for her routine=
 morning
run to  Prospect Park. The other jewels are two lovely cats that hail from =
 brooklyn
(I think). They just sit around on their fluffy butts like  cat's usually d=
o and
 stay outta trouble.
Bedrooms for Sublet:
Entrance floor has: Sunny large living room/kitchen/dining room, 1/2  bath,=
 1 Super
large bedroom for $ 1325 with amazing 12 ft. ceilings,  detailed, original =
crown
 molding AND 10 ft floor to almost ceiling  windows. Perfect for someone wh=
o wants
a large, sunny, private space to  live/work from home.
Upstairs: has 2 tiny bedrooms which we will be taking and the 2nd  massive =
bedroom
for $1375 because it has 2 large closets. It is also a  big, sunny room, pe=
rfect
 for a couple or someone who wants extra space  in which to work, plus a mi=
ddle=20
2nd room which will be a studio space  our resident Jenny, a window display=
 artist/craftastic
designer. If you  like to get crafty and make stuff here and there you can =
use the
space  too! Hoping to have some crafting parties :)
Ideally you would come meet us at our current place to get a feel for  the =
way that
we live, get to know each other and see how we would all  get along. Then w=
e would
swing by the new apartment so that you can see  the actual living space. Su=
nday=20
afternoons are the times we've worked  out with the current occupants of th=
e building
to be able to visit. So  the afternoon of Sunday October 14th would be best=
 to meet
or during the  next week of Oct 15th. Then you can see the actual space if =
all goes
 well. Sorry, we understand it is a bit annoying to not be able to have  mo=
re control
of seeing the apt but with tenants living there till Nov 3  it's tricky. SO=
 it's
 got to be Sundays but we are happy to meet you  during the week and then s=
how you
the place on Sunday if it seems like a  fit.
Aside form the photos we have posted we have a video tour of the  apartment=
 too.
 We can send you the link. REMEMBER- place is currently  occupied by previo=
us tenants,
so please disregard the decor. It will be  clean and empty on move in day S=
unday
 Nov. 3rd. Jenny is fantastic at  interior design so expect an artsy, calm =
and inspiring
environment :) If  you are looking to be part of a warm, open & supportive =
household,
 write to us! Tell us about yourself and please include which bedroom  you'=
re interested
in - $1325 on entry floor with potential to continue  as month to month or =
6 month
lease at least. Or $1375 till Dec 1 only.
Looking forward to meeting you!

LIVE/WORK

$1300 per month, Forte Greene/ Wallabout, 1000 sq. ft., Seeking Artist to s=
hare=20
live/ work loft
Available: October 15th, 2012 through December 1st, 2013
The Space: Two private bedrooms and two semi-private studios. The  availabl=
e bedroom
and studio are across from one another and create  about 450 sq. ft. of pri=
vate=20
space. We share a large, open, dishwasher,  cabinet filled, kitchen, linen =
closet,
coat closet, and large bathroom  with bathtub. There are high ceilings, ama=
zing=20
5th floor views of  downtown Manhattan and Brooklyn.
The Building: Quiet with dogs, families and professionals. No students.  Ga=
y friendly.
There is a laundry room, parking garage ($180 mo. for  cars), roof-deck (mo=
re great
views), an organic grocer, spa, kick-boxing  studio and Cuban Restaurant on=
 the=20
ground floor. There's also front  desk security Monday - Friday (great for =
receiving
packages). Free and  ample parking under the BQE.
The location: The Wallabout Neighborhood is between Fort Greene and the  Na=
vy Yard.
It's like Dumbo ten years ago (yes, safe!). There's a  fantastic Italian Re=
staurant
around the corner. Pratt Graduate Studios,  lived-in lofts, and mix use bui=
ldings
nearby. A short walk up to Myrtle  and Dekalb Street for retail. The Brookl=
yn Flea,
Fort Greene Market and  Park are also nearby.
Commute: Walk or bus to the F train; the bus stops right outside the  build=
ing.=20
There are two more bus lines nearby. The G train is a short  walk, the Q 20=
 minutes.
Please google the address and scope out your  commute beforehand: 275 Park =
Avenue,
Brooklyn NY 11205.
The trade-off for not being very close to the MTA is that the  neighborhood=
 has=20
retained a small town feel. It's also incredibly  beautiful with buildings =
that=20
date back over a hundred years, including  carriage houses.
About the environment: The loft share is for one artist/ creative  person. =
It is
 not set-up for entertaining. I prefer to enjoy the city in  the city and m=
aybe=20
have a guest once a month, before going out. I like  that my roommate doesn=
't have
to come home to five people watching TV  all night. When I'm home, I'm quie=
t. If
 you're looking for a loft share  that has real walls, is healthy and comfy=
 to live
in, environmentally  conscious, where you can focus on your work, are okay =
with=20
a small dog,  and are clean, this is your space!!
The dog: I have a 30lb. Dachshund Mix who's friendly and snuggly. But  the =
place
 isn't doggie, except for the dog. My dog likes people. He  likes hanging o=
ut. Please
be ok with him saying hi in your space.  Friendly and trained dogs are welc=
omed.
The rent is $1300 and includes FIOS. We share electric (about $30 each). Th=
e building
pays for gas.
Building Management will run a credit check before you can move in.  Please=
 have
 good credit, and a job. First and last to move in: $2600.

responsible Aussie girl looking for a  live/work space
Available: 1st December 2012 through 7th January 2013
Hi there. I'm heading to NY to spend a month creating some work for  Under =
The Radar
Festival at The Public Theatre in January. I'm looking  for a space that I =
can live
and work in for about 5 weeks (for all of  December and the first week of J=
an).
I'll mostly be working with drawing, animation, puppets and projection  so =
you wouldn't
need to fear big sloppy colorful messes being left all  over your floor. I'=
m very
considerate and trustworthy, and accustomed to  keeping peoples places fres=
h and
 loved while they're away. I would love  to find somewhere that isn't too c=
luttered
or pristine- somewhere that  has a bit of bohemian charm, and enough room t=
o play
with projection.
A place on my own would be preferable, unless of course it happened to  be =
an absolutely
beautiful space with equally as beautiful people who  didn't mind living wi=
th someone
who is busy at work during all hours of  the day and night, and whose work =
likes
 to take up a fair bit of space..  and require some controlled lighting...
Here's some links to my stuff if you're interested:

QUEER HOUSING COOPERATIVE
Available: 11/01/2012
We are three women who have been collaborating to start a new  cooperative =
home=20
in November. We're the kind of people who get giddy at  the thought of farm=
er's=20
markets. We geek out over alternative health  systems. We daydream about ho=
w to=20
repurpose found materials. Together,  our vision has been to find a home wi=
th enough
space to move, breathe,  stretch, hang out, create, think, find solitude, a=
nd explore
new modes  of connection.
We're currently looking for a house or duplex with a large common space  an=
d additional
rooms for a library/office/guest room and/or a  dance/yoga/meditation/art s=
tudio
 space. We're also looking for two  additional roommates, and/or potentiall=
y a couple,

THINGS WE'RE INTO THAT YOU MIGHT BE TOO:
*  some flavor of queer sexual or gendered identity, practice, expression, =
performance
*  feminist or womanist as a way to empower ourselves and others
*  antiracist, anti-imperialist, and all around anti-oppressive
*  constructive listeners and flexible communicators
*  class-conscious class-warriors
*  spiritually rooted and mindful
*  openhearted and generous
*  interested in sustainable food practices
*  dabblers and aficionados of alternative health practices (reiki, acupunc=
ture,
 yoga, homeopathic medicine, etc.)
*  tinkers and hacks at art-making / idea-making / thing-making
*  community/civic-minded as matter of course
IDEALLY, WE WILL BE:
*  individuals and couples
*  a range of ages: from 20s to 40s
*  a mix of races, abilities, beliefs, mediums
WE IMAGINE WE WILL:
*  share food and household supplies
*  share a weekly meal
*  develop a system for sharing in maintaining a clean, warm home
*  have house meetings, at least at first
SOME CAVEATS:
*  We already have three cats and aren't looking to add more cats/dogs
*  Smokers are okay, but must smoke outside the house
*  Must be willing to take on, at minimum, a one-year lease
*  Must be prepared to pay first month's / deposit / broker's fee, and  pro=
vide=20
all necessary documentation at short notice: 2011 tax forms,  proof of inco=
me, etc

SEEKING ART STUDIOS

$500 per month, Bushwick, 200 sq. feet, but flexible, We need a shared jewe=
lry studio
with ventilation.
Available: 01/01/12 through 01/01/13
Several emerging jewelers are seeking a space of their very own.  Headed  b=
y me,
 a jewelry instructor, we're looking for a space which already  has built i=
n ventilation.
 Because we build jewelry, we will be bringing  in torches, kilns etc.  So =
we'd=20
prefer a space that's pretty fire proof  (drywall is ideal!), that already =
has ventilation
(think exhaust  fan/fume hood) and that is secure enough for our valuable m=
aterials
and  product.  We're open to all sorts of spaces in terms of size and  loca=
tion,
 but would prefer a space that's at least 200 square feet and  preferably i=
n the
 Bushwick area.  We'd also be interested in spaces off  the L train.  Most =
of us
 will simply be building our boutique commercial  lines, but I will also be=
 offering
instruction, so I'd prefer to have a  space that's easily accessible to pub=
lic transit.

ce could  comfortably accommodate two artists. The back studio is occupied =
by a  photographer and two other artists. They have their own separate  ent=

 and subway lines, 15  minutes by train to Manhattan and Park Slope, next d=

 so much space and it's a quiet household. We love  people and are animal f=

beautiful apartment for single female<br /> Available: 12/1/2012 through op=
en<br /><br /> Hi there! My current roommate is moving to Manhattan so I ha=
ve a  wonderful BR available in my 2BR in Prospect Heights. The apartment i=
s a  floor-thru--only 2 other apts in the building. We are on the 2nd floor=
.  The BR is large, with room for a double/queen bed, desk, dresser,  night=
stand etc. Decent closet. I installed built-in bookshelves which  you can r=
emove if you wish but they are really convenient. 2 windows  overlooking ba=
ck garden.<br /> <br /> The rest of the apartment consists of a LR space, d=
ining or workspace,  and a decent-sized, separate kitchen with plenty of co=
unter space and  cabinets. Great if you love to cook!<br /> <br /> The room=
 for rent is unfurnished, so you will have to provide your own.  There is r=
oom for LR furniture as well. I currently have a sofa,  bookcase, coffee an=
d end tables, etc. All of my furniture is mid-century  modern and I would l=
ove to find someone with the same taste. :)<br /> <br /> I am a writer who =
teaches part time at Pratt (in the Writing and  Humanities programs)and at =
CUNY-BMCC. I also work freelance as a  copyeditor for several well-known bo=
ok publishers. My schedule tends to  change, and I do spend a considerable =
amount of time working from home.  So, ideally, you will have a regular, fu=
ll-time day job.<br /> <br /> I am 40, clean, sane, responsible, outgoing a=
nd friendly, but like space  and quiet time and will respect your need for =
the same. Non-smoker. I'm  not really a neat freak, but do keep the place c=
lean. I have a fat,  sweet, adorable cat named Cecil. Cat lovers and cat ow=
ners are welcome,   C is generally friendly to/tolerant of other cats. <br =
/> <br /> What else? This is a FANTASTIC neighborhood. Tree-lined, pretty, =
 convenient to everything. 5 minute walk to 2 at Bergen or Q at 7th ave.  T=
ons of great shops, cafes, bars. 10 minutes walk to Ft Greene, 10  minutes =

0 per month, Crown Heights, Large sunny bedroom in newly renovated 2 br, ut=
ilities included!<br /> Available: November 1, 20120 through November 1, 20=
13<br /><br /> I've just signed a lease on a beautifully renovated 2 bedroo=
m apartment  in Crown Heights, and am looking for a roommate for the second=
 bedroom!  Move in date November 1. The apartment is a floor through, with =
a long,  narrow living room and kitchen; bedrooms, however, are roomy and s=
et  quite far apart, affording a nice measure of privacy. The apartment is =
 on the second floor of a lovely brownstone building on a quiet, adorable  =
block-long street called Virginia Place. It's a 5 minute walk to the 3  at =
Kingston, and a more ambitious one to the C at Kingston/Throop.<br /> <br /=
> The available bedroom is large, and can fit a full bed, desk, and  dresse=
r. It features a full closet, and has two windows which lead out  onto the =
fire escape overlooking the backyard. The rest of the apartment  will be fu=
lly furnished (in a tasteful, antique-leaning style). And  lest I forget to=
 mention the best part, all utilities except internet  are included! So you=
'll be paying a grand total of $815/month.<br /> <br /> I am: a 26 year old=
 female, a native Brooklynite currently attending  grad school full time, g=
etting a Masters in Journalism. I'm out of the  house from 8 am until at le=
ast 6 pm daily, and when I'm home I'm usually  studying quietly. A freelanc=
e chef and food writer by trade, my  interests include gardening, organic/v=
egetarian cooking, reading, old  records (blues/soul/the Stones), movies an=
d bikeriding. I'm a calm,  focused, but laid-back and often goofy person, a=
nd though I value my  personal space/time, I do enjoy the occasional drink,=
 movie, or meal  with the right roomie.<br /> <br /> You should be: impecca=
bly neat and clean, financially responsible, and  drama-free. You should pi=
tch in regularly to keep common areas clean and  tidy, and do things like t=
ake out the trash and recycling of your own  volition. You should be regula=
rly employed, or a full time student. You  must love, or at least like, cat=
s, as I have two. It would be awesome if  we had some interests in common, =
too! No couples, pets, or smokers,  please.<br /> <br /> I will host an ope=
n house at the apartment to meet potential roommates  from 4-7 pm THIS Sund=
ay, October 14th and hope to choose someone by the  end of that day. If int=
erested in attending, please shoot me an email to  let me know. If you're i=
nterested in the apartment but absolutely  cannot attend the open house, ge=
t in touch and I will try to meet you  there at some other time. In the mea=
ntime, I'd love to start a dialogue  with interested applicants, so please =
drop me a line!<br /><br /> <a style=3D"color: black;" shape=3D"rect" href=

the apt with  coffee tea etc. <br /> <br /> I would describe the place as c=
luttered but neat, clean, airey (windows  on all sides) and spacious. I wou=

c 1<br /><br /> Hello all,<br /> <br /> We are so excited to be moving into=
 a gem of an apartment on Nov. 4th.  We have 2 bedrooms for sublet in a bea=
utiful brownstone in ideal Park  Slope location on the corner of 5th & Pros=
pect Place, next to Miriam  and ALL transportation lines. 5 min walk to 2,3=
 at Bergen and the B,Q  at 7th ave. Atlantic center 10 min walk. MOVE IN da=
te is SUNDAY Nov.  4th.<br /> <br /> **Looking for 2 pet friendly singles o=
r couples. We already have 1 super  friendly dog and 2 lovely cats. In sear=
ch of kind, positive,  open-minded, creative, community oriented people to =
sublet rooms in our  gorgeous Park Slope home. The rooms are fairly identic=
al that's why we  provided only one picture of the bedroom. The entry level=
 bedroom is a 1  month sublet with potential to continue month to month (Id=
eally we are  looking for an apt mate who is interested in at least a 6 mon=
th stay).  The other huge bedroom for sublet is located on the 2nd floor of=
 the  duplex apartment and is only for 1 month till Dec 1. Apartment common=
  spaces will be furnished but not the bedrooms for sublet.<br /> <br /> A =
bit about Jenny and me (Dorna): we are late 20's/early 30's. We love  to co=
ok, garden, and share our dreamy home with close friends hosting  dinner, g=
atherings, movie nights etc... We keep the kitchen very tidy,  as well as t=
he rest of the house, although we aren't crazy about it but  taking off you=
r shoes has proven to cut down on the amount of dirt one  tracks in. Jenny =
has an amazing dog, Kaya, and our friends who will be  taking the upstairs =
master bedroom Dec 1 will be bringing two fluffy,  well-behaved cats. The a=
partment is huge and that's exciting. With that  said, we all do share the =
common spaces and one shower so keeping the  common spaces, especially the =
kitchen and bathroom clean is extremely  important. One of us is a chef and=
 others are really into cooking so  tidying up after cooking meals is imper=
ative and lending a hand in  keeping the bathroom clean is too! Did we ment=
ion the dishwasher :) That  will help:) Both of us are involved in the burn=
ing man scene in new  york and appreciate the openness and creativity of th=
e people we've met.  Also, neither of us watch TV. We prefer to have the li=
ving room,  relaxing, inspiring and not centered around a television. But w=
e do love  to watch movies here and there and we have a fantastic projector=
 we  love to use in the living room or for backyard movie parties. Ideally =
we  are hoping for other like-minded folks that are not really into  watchi=
ng TV but if you still like to have one, that's fine, we just  prefer you h=
ook in up in your massive lair :)<br /> <br /> About the gem and the jewels=
 :)<br /> Beautiful huge 2 floor duplex in historic brownstone. 4 separate =
 bedrooms total- 2 tiny ones that we are taking and the other 2 are super  =
large and for sublet. large sunny kitchen connected to a large sunny  dinni=
ng area. Separate living room and second living room on 2nd floor  used as =
a studio, 1 full bath (with iron claw-foot tub!) and another 1/2  bath on m=
ain floor near the living room and kitchen/dinning area .  Backyard with fi=
re pit, wooden porch AND lower patio. Entrance to yard  is off the kitchen.=
 Solid Oak spiral staircase. ****<br /> <br /> Jewels: Kaya is a fluffy, 10=
 yr old blonde border Collie. She is very  well behaved and does NOT bark. =
Her mom, Jenny, career was in dog  trainer a few years back before she came=
 to NYC for Grad school in Fine  Art. Kaya prefers to sleep the day away, s=
niff things in the yard, nudge  at your elbow for petting and to look into =
her eyes and share a  thousand I love you's and she likes to go for her rou=
tine morning run to  Prospect Park. The other jewels are two lovely cats th=
at hail from  brooklyn (I think). They just sit around on their fluffy butt=
s like  cat's usually do and stay outta trouble.<br /> <br /> Bedrooms for =
Sublet:<br /> Entrance floor has: Sunny large living room/kitchen/dining ro=
om, 1/2  bath, 1 Super large bedroom for $ 1325 with amazing 12 ft. ceiling=
s,  detailed, original crown molding AND 10 ft floor to almost ceiling  win=
dows. Perfect for someone who wants a large, sunny, private space to  live/=
work from home.<br /> <br /> Upstairs: has 2 tiny bedrooms which we will be=
 taking and the 2nd  massive bedroom for $1375 because it has 2 large close=
ts. It is also a  big, sunny room, perfect for a couple or someone who want=
s extra space  in which to work, plus a middle 2nd room which will be a stu=
dio space  our resident Jenny, a window display artist/craftastic designer.=
 If you  like to get crafty and make stuff here and there you can use the s=
pace  too! Hoping to have some crafting parties :)<br /> <br /> Ideally you=
 would come meet us at our current place to get a feel for  the way that we=
 live, get to know each other and see how we would all  get along. Then we =
would swing by the new apartment so that you can see  the actual living spa=
ce. Sunday afternoons are the times we've worked  out with the current occu=
pants of the building to be able to visit. So  the afternoon of Sunday Octo=
ber 14th would be best to meet or during the  next week of Oct 15th. Then y=
ou can see the actual space if all goes  well. Sorry, we understand it is a=
 bit annoying to not be able to have  more control of seeing the apt but wi=
th tenants living there till Nov 3  it's tricky. SO it's got to be Sundays =
but we are happy to meet you  during the week and then show you the place o=
n Sunday if it seems like a  fit.<br /> <br /> Aside form the photos we hav=
e posted we have a video tour of the  apartment too. We can send you the li=
nk. REMEMBER- place is currently  occupied by previous tenants, so please d=
isregard the decor. It will be  clean and empty on move in day Sunday Nov. =
3rd. Jenny is fantastic at  interior design so expect an artsy, calm and in=
spiring environment :) If  you are looking to be part of a warm, open & sup=
portive household,  write to us! Tell us about yourself and please include =
which bedroom  you're interested in - $1325 on entry floor with potential t=
o continue  as month to month or 6 month lease at least. Or $1375 till Dec =
1 only.<br /> <br /> Looking forward to meeting you!<br /><br /> <a style=

e live/ work loft<br /> Available: October 15th, 2012 through December 1st,=
 2013<br /><br /> The Space: Two private bedrooms and two semi-private stud=
ios. The  available bedroom and studio are across from one another and crea=
te  about 450 sq. ft. of private space. We share a large, open, dishwasher,=
  cabinet filled, kitchen, linen closet, coat closet, and large bathroom  w=
ith bathtub. There are high ceilings, amazing 5th floor views of  downtown =
Manhattan and Brooklyn. <br /> <br /> The Building: Quiet with dogs, famili=
es and professionals. No students.  Gay friendly. There is a laundry room, =
parking garage ($180 mo. for  cars), roof-deck (more great views), an organ=
ic grocer, spa, kick-boxing  studio and Cuban Restaurant on the ground floo=
r. There's also front  desk security Monday - Friday (great for receiving p=
ackages). Free and  ample parking under the BQE.<br /> <br /> The location:=
 The Wallabout Neighborhood is between Fort Greene and the  Navy Yard. It's=
 like Dumbo ten years ago (yes, safe!). There's a  fantastic Italian Restau=
rant around the corner. Pratt Graduate Studios,  lived-in lofts, and mix us=
e buildings nearby. A short walk up to Myrtle  and Dekalb Street for retail=
. The Brooklyn Flea, Fort Greene Market and  Park are also nearby. <br /> <=
br /> Commute: Walk or bus to the F train; the bus stops right outside the =
 building. There are two more bus lines nearby. The G train is a short  wal=
k, the Q 20 minutes. Please google the address and scope out your  commute =
beforehand: 275 Park Avenue, Brooklyn NY 11205. <br /> <br /> The trade-off=
 for not being very close to the MTA is that the  neighborhood has retained=
 a small town feel. It's also incredibly  beautiful with buildings that dat=
e back over a hundred years, including  carriage houses. <br /> <br /> Abou=
t the environment: The loft share is for one artist/ creative  person. It i=
s not set-up for entertaining. I prefer to enjoy the city in  the city and =
maybe have a guest once a month, before going out. I like  that my roommate=
 doesn't have to come home to five people watching TV  all night. When I'm =
home, I'm quiet. If you're looking for a loft share  that has real walls, i=
s healthy and comfy to live in, environmentally  conscious, where you can f=
ocus on your work, are okay with a small dog,  and are clean, this is your =
space!!<br /> <br /> The dog: I have a 30lb. Dachshund Mix who's friendly a=
nd snuggly. But  the place isn't doggie, except for the dog. My dog likes p=
eople. He  likes hanging out. Please be ok with him saying hi in your space=
.  Friendly and trained dogs are welcomed. <br /> <br /> The rent is $1300 =
and includes FIOS. We share electric (about $30 each). The building pays fo=
r gas. <br /> <br /> Building Management will run a credit check before you=
 can move in.  Please have good credit, and a job. First and last to move i=
n: $2600.<br /><br /> <a style=3D"color: black;" shape=3D"rect" href=3D"htt=

at I can live and work in for about 5 weeks (for all of  December and the f=
irst week of Jan). <br /> <br /> I'll mostly be working with drawing, anima=
tion, puppets and projection  so you wouldn't need to fear big sloppy color=
ful messes being left all  over your floor. I'm very considerate and trustw=
orthy, and accustomed to  keeping peoples places fresh and loved while they=
're away. I would love  to find somewhere that isn't too cluttered or prist=
ine- somewhere that  has a bit of bohemian charm, and enough room to play w=
ith projection.<br /> <br /> A place on my own would be preferable, unless =
of course it happened to  be an absolutely beautiful space with equally as =
beautiful people who  didn't mind living with someone who is busy at work d=
uring all hours of  the day and night, and whose work likes to take up a fa=
ir bit of space..  and require some controlled lighting... <br /> <br /> He=

 out the trash, and scrub the bathroom without you  having to ask.  I am ve=

ke to).  And I have a lot of plants, so I'm  hoping potential roommate(s) w=
