Label News

Hi everyone! It's March and I'm back with another Sorry State Records
label / distro update. Things are coming along swimmingly with the
next couple of releases. Test pressings have been approved for the
Manipulation and Sickoids 12"s, art has been finalized and now it's
just a waiting game until these are released sometime in the vicinity
of April Fool's Day. In the meantime, re-acquaint yourself with the
preview tracks from these two ragers:

Things are also coming along with the upcoming Whatever Brains 3rd
album. The record has been mastered by Josh Bonati, and the next steps
are to cut a lacquer and to get together some artwork. The band
continue to work on their rock opera and have been playing some
absolutely scorching shows around North Carolina. Speaking of raging
Whatever Brains shows, they're playing another one later this month
with Neo-Cons from San Francisco. Also appearing will be =
N=C3=98L=E2=99=A5VE (my
new band... the funky typography is both in allegiance to our =
be=E2=89=A0'd
North Carolinan brethren and to differentiate us from the Bay Area HC
band called No Love) and the premiere of Double Negative's new lineup
with drummer Connor Donnegan (Last Words, Lung Matter, Abuse, etc.).
Connor is a really incredible drummer, and based on the couple of
practices I've dropped in on, DN won't lose a step.

Also in the works are the upcoming sophomore 12"s from Joint D=E2=89=A0 =
and
Brain F=E2=89=A0. The Brain F=E2=89=A0 LP now has a title, Empty Set, and =
the
Joint D=E2=89=A0 now has a final mix that is straight up banging! I'm =
super
excited about both of these, and hopefully we can have them out
sometime late spring / early summer.

A little bit further in the future, we'll have new records from
Libyans (this one is already recorded and currently being mixed... I
haven't heard anything yet, but Liz tells me it's got some real hits)
and Dark Ages (I've heard some four-track demos and they're really
exciting... darker and more complex, but with the intricate
songwriting you've come to expect), and maybe some other surprises
too.

Note for international customers: I know that the recent shipping
hikes have hit you folks pretty hard, and I came up with a couple of
things I can do to help. First, I can consolidate multiple orders so
that you can reserve records as they're added to the web site and have
them shipped only when you have enough to fill a large parcel. Second,
you can have your orders from other distros, ebay sellers, etc.
shipped to me and I can combine them with your Sorry State orders. If
you're interested in either of these options just shoot me an email to
learn more.

Finally, I'm not sure how many of you keep up with Sorry State's
social network profiles, but following the label on Facebook and
Twitter will keep you up to date on all of the new stuff coming
through the distro, since I always post right when I add things to the
web site. Lately I've also been doing some extra-curricular posting on
Twitter, mostly just pithy little musings about what I'm listening to
or what's going on in punk. If you're interested in that at all you
can follow me @sorrystate.

As for the distro, I'm continuing to add great new records every
couple of days. My personal favorites this month are the new Prank
releases, the Stoic Violence 12", the Cola Freaks / Secret Prostitutes
split LP, the Violent Future 7", the Avon Ladies 7", the new Ice Age
LP, the Parquet Courts LP (sadly out of stock at the moment), the Land
of Nod comp LP, and that Noose EP. That's just my personal favorites
though, and the absolute cream of the crop. It's kind of ridiculous
how many great records I added this month. I also restocked a ton of
killer records like the Boston Strangler LP, the Crazy Spirit and Hank
Wood LPs, a bunch of recent Prank Records releases, nearly every
recent Ugly Pop release (and check out their latest two reissues while
you're at it!), and many, many others. Check out the full list below.

Featured Distro Items

Her=C3=A4tys: N=C3=A4en Punaista 7" (Prank)
FINALLY, the US pressing of the swan song by this much-missed Swedish
band. They still have two distinct north and south poles--Totalit=C3=A4r
and Skitkids--that they waver in between... about half the songs on
this record sound just like they could have come from Sin Egan
Motstandare and the other half add in a little rocked-out guitar a la
the Skitkids' later stuff. It's all absolutely brilliant and raging...
a real rampaging EP. Highly recommended.

Effluxus: Devoid 7" (Prank)
Latest record from this new Bay Area project featuring members of the
mighty Morpheme among (many) others. Indeed, there are too many
ex-members-of to count here. The Morpheme connection is the most
apparent, though Effluxus also remind me quite a bit of New York's
Perdition in the way that they blend together a lot of different
styles of noisy, crusty punk to arrive at something that is uniquely
now. There are elements of Disclose's wall of noise, the simplicity of
early Scandinavian hardcore, and the riff assault of more developed
mid-80s stuff, all wrapped up in maximum aggression and songwriting
skill. This also features absolutely gorgeous full-color art from
Guillem from Destino Final. You really can't go wrong with this one.

Big Eyes: Demo 7" (Grave Mistake / Evil Weevil)
New pressing of this demo-tape-to-vinyl, and indeed this recording is
certainly worthy of the format. Four bangers that perfectly combine
the snotty proto-punk of the Runaways with the big hooks and melodies
of 90s indie rock and melodic punk. It sounds like a weird mix when
you describe it, but Big Eyes are really their own thing, and it's
crazy that they emerged this fully-formed. If you have liked any of
the band's other stuff you definitely need to pick this up too.

Village Pistols: Big Money 7" (Last Laugh)
Exacting repro of North Carolina's most substantial offering in the
vintage KBD sweepstakes. As a proud North Carolinian, I'm obviously
very attached to the a-side here, but it really is like the best track
that Dangerhouse never released, sounding uncannily like the Rhino 39
and Dils records on that label, but even faster and more furious. As
for the flip, it's an utter deconstruction of "Strawberry Fields
Forever" that somehow manages to retain the Dangerhouse vibe, but this
time there's a lot more Black Randy in the mix. Any way you slice it
this is a true KBD scorcher.

The Cartoons: She's a Rock and Roller 7" (Last Laugh)
Exacting repro of the one release by this obscure 70s New York punk
band. The a-side is a really epic song... stylistically, it's
somewhere between the Heartbreakers and more '77 UK-influenced stuff,
but it has this really great buildup at the end that sounds unlike
anything else I can really think of. As for the b-side, it's a super
catchy track that could have come right off of LAMF with its snotty,
raunchy rhythm guitar and hooky vox. Another KBD killer back in print
courtesy of Last Laugh.

Endless Grinning Skulls: Fear, Ignorance, Control 7" (Viral Age)
Latest 7" from this burly UK band. As I said in my description of
their earlier 12", EGS seems like a consummate "old guy hardcore"
band. I don't mean that as a slight in any way... rather, it's a
compliment. There's something distinctive about the sound of bands
full of folks who have been around the block a few times, and EGS
definitely have it. They also have an absolutely bruising sound and
anger to spare. If you're into raw, angry hardcore from Doom to
Vorhees to Out Cold you'll love this... seriously top-shelf stuff.

Tranzmitors: I See the Writing on the Wall 7" (React!)
Latest single from this Canadian band who had a huge buzz a few years
ago, but have fallen off my radar as of late. I'm not sure if they're
still going, or if this is really current, but what I do know is that
it contains two songs of top-shelf power pop in the tradition of bands
like Protex, the Pointed Sticks, and the Undertones. The vocalist
still sounds uncannily like early Robert Smith (the Cure), so if the
above references pique your interests pick this up... you won't be
disappointed.

Noose: The War of All Against All 7" (React!)
The best material by this Chicago hardcore band. The lyrics are
militantly straight edge, but the music is straight up hardcore,
completely devoid of any sXe cliches. Noose remind me of bands like
Coke Bust and Blank Stare, i.e. groups that rep the straight edge but
are too angry to cop to any of the youth crew bs. This one was all
over MRR's year-end top 10 lists for 2012, and with good reason.
Recommended if you like the above-mentioned bands, Stripmines,
Oblivionation, Out Cold, etc.

Trauma: 10 Song EP 7" (Bulkhead)
Vinyl pressing of Trauma's 10-song demo tape, and while the recording
is a little bit rawer than their 12" on Feral Ward, this is definitely
worthy of being on vinyl. As on their LP, Trauma play blistering
short, sharp shocks of hardcore informed by the Scandinavian classics,
but with a USHC touch. Features members of countless bands like
Tragedy, Final Warning, Deathreat, Criminal Damage, etc., but the most
important references are probably Final Warning and Deathreat. 10
blistering hardcore songs straight out of 1982... if you dig old Euro
core you really can't do any better than this. No cliches, no posing,
just rage.

Really Red: Crowd Control 7" (bootleg)
Spot-on repro of this classic Texas punk single. Really Red
eventually evolved into a kind of quirky art-rock/hardcore band a la
the Minutement or even the Pop Group, but for this first single they
were pure anthemic punk in the '77 tradition, and it's fitting that
"Crowd Control" has been comped numerous times on records like Killed
by Death and Deep in the Throat of Texas. It really is one of the
all-time great KBD anthems, and the moody b-side ain't no slouch
either.

Skrewdriver: You're So Dumb 7" (Bootleg)
Exact repro (albeit with a change in the spot color) of this '77 punk
/ pub rock classic. I know some may disagree with my decision to carry
this record, but aside from one extremely fucked-up member who
appropriated the name, this band has very little in common with the
later era of the group. Musically, this is in the vein of Eddie and
the Hot Rods, Dr. Feelgood, etc., but with the energy level absolutely
through the roof... Skrewdriver were on a whole different level than
basically any other band playing pub rock at the time, and while this
isn't their best material it's definitely a ripper.

Various: By Any Means cassette (Stay Punk / Thrillhouse)
Brand new compilation of Bay Area punk bands. This is an ambitious
endeavor, and a lot more effort has clearly gone into this cassette
than what goes into most vinyl releases. Pro-duplicated tapes with
pro-printed J-cards, featuring one track each from Neon Piss,
Sourpatch, Synthetic ID, Street Eaters, Comadre, No Statik, Apogee
Sound Club, Index, True Mutants, Hunting Party, Violent Change,
Permanent Ruin, C'est Dommage, Cold Circuits, Saint Lorena, Daikon,
Replica, Endemics, New Flesh, Huff Stuff Magazine, and Nasty
Christmas. A range of different styles are represented, but all of the
bands are DIY punk. A great sampler of what's going on in the Bay Area
right now.

Welcome to the Midwest zine
A bunch of midwestern zinesters getting together for a little
mini-zine that is basically a bunch of top 10 of 2012 lists. All
records / shows / bands / etc. get a little description, there are
some rad cut-and-paste layouts... all in all an excellent little music
zine. The styles covered are more or less what I tend to carry in the
distro, so if you're a list junkie you'll eat this up.

As Boredom Sets in Summer 2012 zine
As the title states, this was released in summer 2012 and features
interviews with Secret Prostitutes, Video, and Slugz, along with a ton
of other writing about recent punk and hardcore. While not quite as
"literary" as zines like Got Myself or Distort, As Boredom Sets In's
enthusiasm carries through and makes this a chaotic but enjoyable
read.

As Boredom Sets in Winter 2012
This time around you get interviews with Sucked Dry and Birth
Deformities, in addition to the usual assortment of reviews and other
writings, all wrapped up in an energetic cut-and-paste layout. This is
what zines were like before everyone had a blog! Viva zines!

Various: Bloodstains Across the UK 12"
Yet another in this long line of infamous comps. These kinds of
series have a reputation for diminishing returns, but this volume is
pretty much all-killer no-filler to my ears, making up in
listenability what it lacks in obscurity. Plus, on this volume the
compiler has chosen to comp entire EPs where the music warranted it,
which definitely makes for a stronger listening experience. Featuring
raw, vintage tracks from Machines, Valves, XS Energy, Lucy, Art
Attacks, Klips 1968, Pseudo Existors, Stiffs, Blanks, and Rivals.

Generacion Suicida: Demo 12" (Symphony of Destruction)
The demo tape from this talked-about LA band pressed to 12" vinyl
courtesy of the French label Symphony of Destruction. I believe
they've cleaned up the sound considerably from the cassette version
(which I also carried in the distro), and the band's dual-vocal,
Gorilla Angreb / Masshysteri / Daylight Robbery-style melodic punk
comes across a lot stronger on wax. Very handmade and very limited, so
don't sleep.

The Shirks: S/T 12" (Grave Mistake)
Debut 12" from this Baltimore band who represent quite a different
sound than anything Grave Mistake has done before. To my ears, this
has a very 90s garage/punk sound, reminding me of Rip Off
Records-style bands (including, most notably, the Rip Offs themselves)
as well as Japanese bands like Teengenerate and the Registrators. As
with the best of those bands, the energy level here is off the charts,
the production is pretty much piss-raw, and the hooks abound.
Excellent stuff.

Big Boys: Where's My Towel / Industry Standard 12" (Light in the
Attic)
Absolutely GORGEOUS reissue of this classic Big Boys 12", probably
the hardest-to-find record in their discography save the debut "Frat
Cars" 7". I've always thought the Big Boys were a really interesting
band because they went on for so long and encompassed so much. They
started kinda like KBD punk, went through a bunch of styles, embraced
hardcore (ethically if not aesthetically) and then ended up as
something totally unique, able to shift gears rapidly between
breakneck hardcore punk and grooved-out funk. Where's My Towel is
probably the band's most consistent record; at least, it's one of the
only ones on which all of the songs sound like they were written by
the same band. I'm guessing that the members were listening to lots of
first-wave post-punk at this stage... I'm reminded of Warsaw, early
Wire, the Pop Group's more tuneful moments, and in general the more
straightforward subset of the early Rough Trade Records crowd. Like
the best of those bands, the Big Boys could both write a hook and ride
a groove, and they do both admirably on this release. Features a
much-expanded version of the original layout, including an awesome
gatefold jacket.

Living Void: Squalor 12" (Crime Minister)
Debut 12" from this grind / power violence band from Boston. These
guys seem to be coming from a more metal end of things than the
Infest-inspired PV stuff I usually carry, but the more prominent
metallic influences allow Living Void to foray into more interesting /
creative riffing as well as (somewhat unexpectedly) more variety and
catchiness in the vocals. Some of the parts are also pretty much
straight up death metal, which is very cool to hear mixed into this
style. If you're a metal omnivore whose tastes extend to thrash,
death, grind, and even a bit of hardcore give this a try.

Various: Land of Nod 12" (Scavenger of Death)
Well, if this isn't the best compilation LP to come out in the past
decade or more, then I really don't know what is. First of all, the
quality of the bands represented here is just astounding. Everyone
knows that Atlanta is a hotbed of punk, and with tracks from Bukkake
Boys (their final recordings), Ralph, Manic, GG King, Gentleman Jesse,
Manic, Cops, Wymyns Prysyn, Shaved Christ, Predator, and even more,
this record more than adequately makes the case, particularly since I
don't think a single band contributes anything close to "B" material.
Second, the sound of the thing itself is remarkably cohesive, nearly
all of the tracks having been recorded by Ryan from Bukkake Boys /
Scavenger of Death (many of them on the same day, in fact)... so even
though the bands represented here are all very different, there's a
similar sound that links them all together, making the comp run way
more like a single LP than just about any other that I can think of.
Finally, the whole package is gorgeously executed with a trademark
Scavenger of Death design job courtesy GG King. This thing is pretty
much just hit after hit... if you like punk you need this LP.

Shrills: Melt Down 12" (Resurrection)
Fuzzy, catchy garage-punk from this Orange County band. Way more punk
than most of the bands who tend to get tagged with terms like "fuzz,"
"psych," or even "garage," the Shrills sound to me less Puffy Areolas
and more Thee Oh Sees / Hunches. In other words, there's a 60s
influence, but the basis is catchy, upbeat punk.

Outer Minds: Behind the Mirror 12" (Resurrection)
2nd LP from this Chicago band (their first was on Southpaw) who play
incredibly authentic 60s psychedelic rock / pop. It really is amazing
how fully this evokes the classics... in particular, I can't stop
thinking of that Masters Apprentices single that Ugly Pop reissued a
while back, though the more obvious influences would be the more
rockin' / American end of the 60s psych sound. Great songwriting
throughout... this will definitely scratch your retro psych itch.

Funerary Box: Hell-Hammered Horror 12" (Rescued from Life)
Latest 12" from this cult metal band. As if it weren't obvious from
the record's title, the influences here are primarily from the
international scene of raw metal that so influenced the first
generation of black metal bands... think Hellhammer, Venom, Sarcofago,
Impetigo, etc. This definitely has its own unique thing going on...
the vocals are a little death-ier than I associate with the style, and
the music can swing back and forth between primitive Hellhammer-esque
bashing and a slightly more rocking, Venom-inspired sound, but the
whole thing is raw, mean, and very dark. They even finish things off
with a blistering Rolling Stones cover... didn't see that one coming,
did you?

The Kick: S/T 12" (Static Age)
Compilation of studio sessions by this 70s Swiss punk/post-punk band.
If you know that this band is a 70s Swiss post-punk band with a lady
singer (not sure of the genders of the other members), you're probably
already preparing yourself for a Kleenex reference, but honestly
that's really not appropriate at all. The Kick are definitely way more
polished and pop than that. It isn't just that they can really play,
it's that they really do sound like they take a lot of influence from
the more radio-friendly (at least in the UK) end of the post-punk
sound... bands like the Cure, Siouxsie (whom the singer sounds quite
like at times), etc. As those references indicate, this has a bit of a
dark / goth vibe, but it also still feels really punk... given the
attention given to bands like Belgrado recently, I could see people
really flipping out for this band.

Wake Up Dead: Northern Girls 7" (EZPZ)
Latest 3-song single from this London band featuring members of Black
Time, Black Mamba Beat, and Live Fast Die, among many others. These
three songs remind me a lot of the best guitar-driven, poppy post-punk
/ new wave of the early 80s... I'm thinking of bands like the Soft
Boys, the Sound, and maybe even early Kiwi stuff like Clean, though
this is much more raw and DIY sounding than any of those bands.
There's also a slight bit of that druggy / 70s New York kind of vibe
that I get off of some Pink Reason stuff. At root, though, these are
three insanely catchy, well-written songs delivered with raw punk
energy... what's not to like?

Pointed Sticks: What Do You Want Me to Do? 7" (Ugly Pop)
Yes, another late 70s Canadian punk smasher from Ugly Pop! This time
it's a personal favorite, the debut single from Pointed Sticks,
originally released by Quintessence Records in 1978. If you don't know
the Sticks, along with Teenage Head they were probably the best-known
of Canada's '77 set, though they definitely had more of a poppy / new
wave-ish sound than similar American bands. This would fit in
extremely well with stuff like Elvis Costello, Wreckless Eric, Protex,
the Speedies, etc. Later on in their career they would get a little
bit too syrupy for my tastes (the production on some of their later
stuff also left a bit to be desired), but this debut single is the
band at their rawest, most energetic, and most punk. If you dig stuff
like the aforementioned bands or even more obscure stuff like the
Nasty Facts, do yourself a favor and pick this up. A total banger.
(Note: the reissue has a blue cover, unlike the pink one pictured)

The Bureaucrats: Feel the Pain 7" (Ugly Pop)
Ugly Pop does it again! I'd actually never heard this 1978 single by
the Bureaucrats, but man is it a banger! It has that perfect, poppy
70s punk sound that I will love until my dying day... fans of Protex,
the Jam, the Undertones, and other bands that combined a huge guitar
sound with punk energy and instantly-memorable vocal hooks will flip
for this. I hope I never run out of incredible singles like this to
discover... wow.

Dime Runner: Race to Nowhere cassette (Resurrection)
Cassette-only album from this punk band from Fullerton, California.
These guys are definitely of a piece with a lot of what was happening
in the late 90s OC / Fullerton scene, sounding quite a bit like the
Stitches, Smogtown, etc. In other words, it's tough, three-chord punk
influenced by the British classics, maybe with a bit of Thunders
guitar thrown in and some KBD snottiness in the vox.

Predator: S/T cassette (Scavenger of Death)
Compilation of studio material by this long-running Atlanta band.
Predator started life as the Frantic, had a really killer, underrated
LP that sounded kind of like the Zero Boys, and then morphed into
Predator and went on to release an LP on Rob's House several years ago
that pretty much went totally under the radar (in fact, as of this
writing I still have copies in the distro if you're looking). They've
been pretty quiet on the vinyl front since then. If you haven't hit a
show in Atlanta you could probably be forgiven for thinking the band
broke up, but they've been playing sporadically the whole time,
evolving concurrently with related bands like GG King, Beat Beat Beat,
Cops, Gentleman Jesse, etc. This pro-duplicated cassette collects 15
songs from various recording sessions, and if you follow Atlanta punk
this is pretty essential stuff... if you play your records by GG King,
Cops, etc., you should definitely pick this up as well.

Wymyns Prysyn: 2nd 7" (Pygmy)
2nd EP from this Atlanta band who play killer, catchy punk with some
post-punk tendencies. I suppose it's not a million miles away from
what one thinks of as the "Atlanta sound" (i.e. Carbonas / Beat Beat
Beat), but rather than basing things off a classic pop template, this
one seems to come from a more artsy / deliberate direction. In the end
it's just as catchy, but the catchy seems to be from somewhere else...
it's almost like these are early New Order songs played at blistering,
near-hardcore tempos, but then again it also reminds me of the punkier
end of 90s British rock... Supergrass maybe? Or maybe China Drum...
I'm stumped! Regardless, this is a really stellar EP... strongly
recommended. Limited to 300 copies with screen printed jackets.

JJ-180: Talk Talk b/w Classroom 7" (Alona's Dream)
Archival release from this extremely obscure '77 punk band from Santa
Cruz, California. The a-side is a Music Machine cover, and it's pretty
faithful to the original except that it's played at nearly double
speed... the energy level is really through the roof here. As for the
flip, it's an original with a similar set of influences, but a little
more traditionally "punk" sounding. Fans of the Plugz or the Nuns will
definitely be digging this. Cool packaging, too, including a die-cut
jacket, color vinyl, and a bunch of inserts.

Bored Youth: November 1981 7" (Alona's Dream)
Vinyl release of the first studio recording by this first-gen Detroit
hardcore band from 1981. This is raw, primitive hardcore that fits
right in with the early Dischord / Touch and Go crowd... perfect raw,
aggressive production, awesomely simple, direct, and catchy
songwriting, and really just everything you love about early 80s
hardcore. If you still get mileage out of classics by SOA, the Teen
Idles, and the early Necros stuff you definitely want this. The
packaging is also stellar, too... this is the same label that did the
recent Necros demo reissue, and it includes color vinyl,
screen-printed dust jackets, and a whole bunch of inserts. Gorgeous.

Raw Nerve: Head Trauma: The Final Raw Nerve Tour DVD
Man, am I stoked about this thing. With the technology to record and
edit video becoming so cheap and easy to use, I've been wondering why
there haven't been more DIY / punk video projects, and here comes this
bad boy to fill the void. The centerpiece here is a short (not sure of
the exact running time, but I'd guess 30-40 minutes) documentary about
the final run of Raw Nerve shows. The documentary is extremely
well-produced, interesting, and well-paced. Honestly, I've seen
"professional" punk documentaries (like the recent Circle Jerks doc,
for instance) that are far less polished and a hell of a lot less fun
to watch. If you're a fan of Raw Nerve (and why wouldn't you be?
They're one of the best hardcore bands of the past decade) you
definitely want this. The DVD is also packed to the gills with full
performances from throughout the tour, including a scorching
live-in-the-studio set at WFMU. If you're a punk doc junkie like me,
you'll definitely want to pick this up.

Vaccine: Dead Inside 7" (Painkiller)
Latest 7" from this blistering fast, noisy, and aggressive hardcore
band. Very much in the Painkiller house style, these tracks are raw
and aggressive and betray the influence of both the meanest of classic
hardcore (Negative Approach, SOA, etc.) and the most primitive
ultra-fast hardcore (Siege, Infest). 10 rippers with perfectly raw
production.

Hassler: Amorality 7" (Beach Impediment)
2nd 7" from this Toronto hardcore band featuring former members of
one of the most underrated No Way Records bands, Reprobates. With
simple, brutal, and catchy riffs and tough-as-nails vocals, this
definitely fits in with fellow Toronto groups like Urban Blight and
Violent Future. If you dig those two bands you'll be well-served by
checking this out as well. Killer artwork to boot. On the top-notch
Beach Impediment label.

The Mighty Fevers: F***'n Great R'N'R 12" (Dead Beat)
Debut LP from this garage-punk band from Kobe, Japan. The label
description references Teengenerate, the Registrators, and Guitar
Wolf, and those are pretty much the exact same reference points I
would have made... a lot of bands go for this sort of punk-infused
retro garage sound, but very few can match the insane, over-the-top
energy of Teengenerate's best stuff. The Mighty Fevers, however, do...
if you crave that patented combination of blown-out-guitar, big vocal
hooks, and over-the-top frantic energy (or if you just like punk
played so fast and hard that it almost sounds like hardcore), this one
is highly recommended.

Agent Orange: Living in Darkness 12" (Drastic Plastic)
Brand new pressing of one of my all-time favorites. Though they're
often lumped in with other early 80s SoCal punk bands like the
Adolescents and TSOL, Agent Orange had an utterly unique sound. Sure,
they relied a bit more heavily on surfy guitar than most bands and
they covered "Pipeline," but they're more than just the OG "surf punk"
band. They're a band with an utterly unique songwriting style and
vibe, writing melodies as memorable as anything Cock Sparrer ever did
while creating as strong a vibe as the early Joy Division or Bauhaus
records. If you haven't heard this record, I highly encourage you to
pick up this extremely nice edition with new mastering and color
vinyl... it's a fitting way to preserve one of the most unique and
powerful LPs in the history of punk.

Prisoner Abuse: S/T 12" (Painkiller)
Yet more vinyl output from the modern-day Boston Crew... this time
around you have members of Think I Care, Waste Management, No
Tolerance, and Mind Eraser laying down some straight-up bruising
hardcore. SSD is the obvious influence, and there are none of the
Infest-inspired / power violence leanings of some of the
aforementioned bands... just straight up hardcore. Definitely not as
much of a stone-cold classic as the Boston Strangler record, but a
bruiser nonetheless.

Iceage: You're Nothing 12" (Matador)
2nd LP from this band of Danish youngsters. I always kind of wondered
if their first album was a fluke... on that record, it almost sounded
like they wanted to be a hardcore band, but didn't quite get it right
and ended up with something much more interesting. On this LP,
however, it's clear that the band, in fact, have an extremely
deliberate and original voice. Both the songs and the overall "vibe"
of the record here are truly outstanding... really like nothing else
I've ever heard in my life, and not only is it singular, but
compelling as well.  There's a reason why bands like Iceage, F***ed
Up, and Ceremony get signed to big indie labels like Matador; it's
because they have an utterly unique voice and are making genuinely new
and exciting music. If you come to records just wanting to hear an
established sound done well, then you're going to hate this record.
If, however, you want each record in your collection to be special, to
have a sound like no other, and further if you like music to surprise
you, then you absolutely much hear this. And, of course, if you liked
New Brigade then you absolutely need to hear this, because it's about
50 times better. I can't say enough good things about this... highly
recommended.

Plutocracy: Sniping Pigz 12" (Six Weeks)
Repressing of this classic grind / power violence record. Originally
recorded during a brief regrouping in 1998 (the band originally
existed from 1988-93), this was right during the heyday of second-wave
power violence that I associate most strongly with Spazz's early
stuff. Like those records, this one is chock full of movie and hip-hop
samples, blistering fast parts and pit-clearing breakdowns. If vintage
power violence is your thing, you know you need this.

Get High: Demos 1996-7 12" (Painkiller)
Collection of demos from this mid-90s Boston hardcore/punk band. I
remember when these guys were around... I never really paid them much
mind, but apparently the band--and these recordings in particular--are
held in very high regard by Boston folk. Listening to this record
today, I can definitely hear why. In fact, it still sounds
surprisingly fresh. The most obvious point of comparison is Swiz; like
that band, Get High takes post-hardcore instrumentation (particularly
the more delicate/complex riffing style) and grafts it onto a more
energetic, classic punk/hardcore template. The singer even sounds a
bit like Shawn Brown. Limited to 289 hand-numbered copies on
heavyweight vinyl with screen printed jackets and a poster insert.

Night Marchers: Allez! Allez! 12" (Swami)
New LP from this latest John Reis (Rocket from the Crypt, Drive Like
Jehu, Hot Snakes) project. On their first LP, Night Marchers
definitely sounded like a Reis band, but their sound was much more
polished than anything he'd done since Scream Dracula Scream-era RFTC.
On this 2nd LP, the recording is considerably grittier, but the riffs
and songwriting are as sophisticated, surprising, and polished as you
would expect. If you're a fan of Reis's previous bands I'd certainly
suggest checking this out, even if you were turned off by the
glossiness of their first LP.

Defiant Pose #7 zine (UK Fanzines 1977-84)
Wow, this is really something here. Basically, this is a history of
DIY UK fanzines covering the titular years. Painstakingly researched
and written, I'm surprised that this wasn't published as a book, but
given the subject matter I guess a big fat stack of photocopied pages
is much more appropriate. Apparently this thing is the product of over
10 years of research, and it shows. A ridiculous amount of knowledge
is contained herein, not to mention hundreds upon hundreds of images
from vintage zines. Talk about value for money... if you're as big a
nerd about '70s and early 80s UK punk as I am this is essential
reading.

Down and Out #26 zine
Latest issue of this downright amazing Australian zine. This issue
focuses, as the intro states, on "ugly, dirty, blown-out hardcore" and
features interviews with Need, School Shootings, Herpes, Fumes,
Salvation, and Goosebumps, along with a ton of other writing on
related and similar zines, records, etc. With 46 full-size pages this
will sustain you through quite a few bathroom visits, but more
important than the quantity is the quality. Sam is one of those people
who can write about hardcore in a way that perfectly suits the
music... unlike people like me (and the vast majority of, say, MRR
reviewers, for instance) who listen to things once and hastily type up
a description, you can tell that Sam really listens to thinks closely,
lets them percolate, and appreciates the overall experience of
listening to the music. With the aforementioned style of hardcore,
this is often an uncomfortable and violent experience, and that
definitely comes through. Still, this isn't abstract poetry, they're
record reviews and band interviews, but done with thought, care, and
attention to detail that are incredibly rare. As for as zines go, this
is without a doubt one of the best ones going.

Avon Ladies: 2nd 7" (Fashionable Idiots / Distort)
Avon Ladies... man, what a band! I was lucky enough to catch them
live a handful of times last summer, and they were genuinely one of
the most exciting, dangerous, and thrilling live bands that I've ever
seen. I liked the band based on their earlier 7" on Katorga Works, but
I became downright obsessed with them after seeing them live, and was
extremely sad to hear that they'd broken up only a few months later.
Ultimately, I think that the raw, chaotic power of the band's live set
was best caught on the rehearsal recordings they released on limited
cassettes (you may have picked up copies at Chaos in Tejas 2012), but
their records remain indispensable documents. In particular, I'm
beyond stoked to finally have a studio version of "Candy Sex," which
has one of the most undeniable riffs I've heard in years and a
mega-catchy chorus to boot. Absolutely essential.

Grabbies: Live 7" (Fashionable Idiots / Distort)
Re-release of this notorious document, which was originally released
in a tiny edition of 200 copies years ago, and has been prized by
collectors ever since. The Grabbies were a San Francisco punk band led
by Italian troublemaker Alessandro / Anus, who would go on to front
Fashionable Idiot faves Out with the Bang a few years later. This
record is a soundboard recording from the band's one and only tour,
and it's pretty much a 100% authentic document of what it's like to
see one of Alessandro's bands live. There's lots of cursing, some
insanely hilarious crowd baiting, and wedged in there somewhere are a
handful of tracks of raw, abrasive hardcore punk. Whether you're
coming to this for the stage banter or the music, you'll be pleased,
so just get it, m'kay?

Wild Child: Demo 7" (Fashionable Idiots)
Demo tape pressed to vinyl from this Minneapolis band. Man, these
guys have a really cool and unique sound that I can't pinpoint. The
label description mentions both the Germs and This Is Boston Not LA,
and I can hear either/or more on some songs than others. I also hear a
lot of other early Dangerhouse punk like the Dils and Rhino 39, since
this has a thin, scratchy guitar sound but is also catchy and full of
aggression. It's really refreshing to hear a band that doesn't know
precisely what subgenre they fit into, but are just going for it and
making really aggressive, passionate music that is catchy and
memorable. Those who like old stuff will definitely dig this, but it's
definitely not a retro record. So, I guess if you like any of the
aforementioned bands give this a try, but be ready for the record to
surprise you.

Suspect: Demo cassette (Paranoid Futures)
Demo tape from this new LA hardcore band featuring members of Tear It
Up, Rough Kids, and Deep Sleep, among many others. This is one of
those bands that seems to have jumped right out of the gate with a
fully-formed and distinctive sound, which I guess is unsurprising
given the members' veteran status. Of the above-mentioned bands, the
one that Suspect sounds the most like is Tear It Up... they have the
same stripped-down, aggressive yet catchy vibe, but there's a lot more
happening as well. For one, Nick from Deep Sleep provides some really
killer leads that are mega-catchy without being wanky or overtly
melodic, and the songwriting in general is tight and memorable. With
such great songs, strong production, and killer artwork I'd bet this
will be a sought-after demo sooner rather than later.

Violent Future: S/T 7" (Slasher)
After an earlier demo-put-to-vinyl, here's the proper debut 7" from
Toronto's Violent Future, and HOLY CRAP does it rage. This is total
knuckle-dragging skinhead hardcore that sparks feelings of violence
even in me. The songs crawl along at a menacing pace until the last
track, "War on the Streets," which drops the tempo even further and
just erupts in complete violence. If you dig 86 Mentality, Urban
Blight, or the classics like Negative Approach and Blitz, don't sleep
on this... a GREAT debut. Totally killer packaging as well, with a
2-color print on recycled stock jackets.

Pinkeye: Worldwide Columbine 12" (Slasher)
12" EP from this short-lived project featuring Damian "Pink Eyes"
Abraham from F***ed Up on vocals. When this hit the streets it felt
like it was largely in line with the early F***ed Up material, but
listening back to this a few years later I feel like there's a
distinct crossover vibe. It reminds me quite a bit of the Acc=C3=BCsed or
Dealing with It-era DRI, but with Abraham's trademark vocals. In other
words, it's tough, metallic, mega-fast but still insanely catchy and
punk.

Blitz: Voice of a Generation 12" (Papag=C3=A1juv Hlasatel)
European re-release of this absolute, stone-cold skinhead classic. I
mean, seriously, what is there to say about a record like this? An
obviously huge influence on first-generation American hardcore bands
like Negative Approach and SOA, this is one of the toughest,
catchiest, and most memorable punk full-lengths ever. Essential.

Artcore zine #30 with State Funeral 7"
Latest issue of this long-running UK zine, this time with a 7" from
the UK's State Funeral. State Funeral is a new band from the U.K. This
is the first 7=E2=80=9D EP =E2=80=98Protest Music=E2=80=99 of political =
hardcore punk
(you can hear three tracks here... http://statefuneral.bandcamp.com/)
The EP has six tracks and comes in a two colour sleeve as eight page
booklet, with a patch and download code. Note: The download code also
includes the entire TERMINAL DECAY 20 band international compilation
LP from last issue.

In this issue, Artcore features interviews with the Magnificent and
Boss Tuneage Records from the U.K., Nothing from Germany, Out Of Trust
and No Mistake from the U.S., as well as the director of the All Ages
Boston Hardcore Film; Drew Stone, and a new interview with Ron Reyes,
formerly of Black Flag. After years of being somewhat overlooked by
punk historians, Vaultage finally features the complete history of
Government Issue. Helge Schreiber writes at length about Hardcore
Holland, featuring; BGK, Deadlock, Disgust, Indirekt, Larm, Neuroot,
Pandemonium and Funeral Oration. Helge also allowed us to publish the
English translation of excerpts from his book =E2=80=98Network Of
Friends=E2=80=99, with contributions from Ian MacKaye, Henry Rollins, Dave
Dictor, John Stabb and many more. Thirty years on from the release of
the Faith/Void split LP, Andy Nystrom talks to Chris Stover of Void,
and Michael Hampton of Faith about the record. David Ensminger talks
to members of Really Red and Mydolls, and Welly writes about Gigs of
the Eighties, as well as G.I. There are of course, many reviews,
columns and other stuff, as well as photos and graphics.

Artcore #29 with Terminal Decay compilation 12"
Issue 29 of this long-running UK zine featuring Amebix, Night Birds,
Arctic Flowers, 1981, Ruidosa Immundicia, Hygiene, Agent Orange, MDC,
Alec Mackaye, and many more. This issue also comes with a killer
international punk compilation featuring mostly-exclusive tracks from
1981, the Rebel Spell, the Furloughs, Bad Sam, Arctic Flowers,
Fracaso, Knuste Rutter, Agent Attitude, 40 Hells, Hygiene, Night
Birds, Ruidosa Immundicia, Burnt Cross, Off with Their Heads, DHK,
Endless Grinning Skulls, Vengeance, Pettybone, the Estranged, and
Burning Sensation. Obviously this is a ridiculous value for what
you're getting, and as you can see from the track list this comp has
some pretty damn essential music. Get on it!

Artcore #28 zine
Summer 2011 issue of this long-running UK fanzine. This time around
you get features on Young Offenders, the Arrivals, the Estranged,
Smogtown, Wipers, the Proletariat, Modern Method Records, HDQ, and
features on 80s UK punk zines and West German punk.

Artcore #26 zine
2009 issue of this legendary UK zine. Features on the S**ty Limits,
Shot Baker, Capital, Harbour, Warprayer, Angry Samoans, the Cramps,
NOTA, Flex! zine, and tons more. As always, this is absolutely packed
with top-shelf content.

Artcore #25 zine with Beef People 7"
Issue 25 of this UK fanzine, with features on Double Negative,
Violent Arrest, Off with Their Heads, Jeff Nelson, Aimee Cooper, the
Nuns, Ripcord, Lookout! Records, and this time around you get a 7" of
unearthed material by 80s Virginia HC band Beef People (recorded by
Don Zientara at Inner Ear, so it's got that same rough-and-tumble feel
of all of the early Dischord stuff.

Porcharitas: Get Wasted with... 7" (Vertical House)
4-song 7" from this all-girl band that have that perfect combination
of Ramones riffs, girl group vocal hooks, and punk aggression. This
sounds strikingly similar to the raw, early Midnite Snaxxx singles
(and, by extension, the Bobbyteens and all of their related bands),
and like Midnite Snaxxx these girls really know how to write a song.
If you dig wild, raw, and aggressive pop music this little EP is
essential. Recommended!

War Emblem: demo cassette (self-released)
Demo tape from this Philadelphia band with a really energetic sound.
At first they sound like a super energetic crust band, reminding me a
lot of Brain Killer's more straightforward and explosive material, but
the beefy production and more metallic parts betray a wider set of
influences. In particular, lots of songs have these mid-paced
breakdown parts that remind me of 90s metallic hardcore, i.e. stuff
that seemed influenced in equal parts by the Cro-Mags and early
Metallica (they can also occasionally sound like early Converge or
Coalesce, but don't let that scare you!). So, I guess you could call
this crusty, metallic hardcore, but it's a lot more interesting,
energetic, and inventive than bands that typically get that
description. If a label like Southern Lord latched onto this I could
see it getting huge, as it's original, aggressive, and instantly
appealing. A really killer demo.

Cola Freaks / Secret Prostitutes: Split 12" (Bad Hair Life)
Wow, what a pair-up! First up are the almighty Secret Prostitutes,
one of the most unique and notorious bands in the current punk scene,
dishing out seven more blasts of their simple, catchy punk. I hesitate
to call what they're doing a formula--since when you actually listen
closely, the songs are all quite unique and different from one
another--but they definitely have a distinctive sound, one built
around a muscular rhythm section, simple and melodic guitar that
recalls classics like Asta Kask or even the Toy Dolls, and the
oh-so-unique vocals, which are some of the most distinctive and
memorable to be committed to vinyl in some time. In short, if you
already know the Secret Prostitutes you need these new tracks, and if
you haven't heard them before this is as good a place to start as any.
On the flip side we have the final material from Denmark's Cola
Freaks. The Cola Freaks are, without a doubt, one of my favorite bands
of the past decade or so, and I was really sad to hear they broke up.
All the more so, as this material definitely hints at some growth
since their last LP for Rob's House Records. The first two songs sound
almost like they could have come from that LP--nervous, agitated
garage rock with super catchy vocals. However, the 3rd track "Om Jeg
Kan Lide Det?" is probably the most melodic thing the band ever did,
almost recalling the Marked Men with its mega-catchy chorus, and the
last song, "Had for Had," is a droning, repetitive song that recalls
the early Fall, a direction that I'm surprised the Cola Freaks didn't
explore sooner. Like all of the Secret Prostitutes records, this is
pretty darn limited (only 1,000 copies, but the bulk of them went to
Europe), and with the added incentive of this being the last Cola
Freaks material I don't expect this one to hang around long. However,
if you follow either of these great bands (you should be following
both!) you really need this split LP.

My Kind of Town Vol 1 zine VHS
Debut issue of this new VHS video zine from Philadelphia. I don't
actually own a VHS, so I'm not able to tell you about the quality of
the footage and/or audio, but this features live tracks from Altered
Boys, Kremlin, Ga$h, Bad Energy, Brainslug, Self Loathing, and Dirty
Work. I'm not sure how many of you out there still have VHS players,
but this is way cooler than a YouTube channel.

Sauna Youth: False Jesii Pt. II b/w Oh Joel 7" (Static Shock)
Latest single from this English band, and its quite different than
any of their previous material. Their early stuff seemed, to me at
least, to be pretty heavily indebted to the S***ty Limits, but this is
just straight up, harmony-drenched DIY indie-pop. C86 references are
obligatory, and dare I say warranted. The a-side is actually a Pissed
Jeans cover (completely re-imagined, naturally), while the flip side
is a similarly fetching original. Static Shock Records never steers us
wrong, and if you dig the sound of bands like the Shop Assistants
you'll flip out for this... great record.

Hoax: Caged b/w Sick Punk 7" (La Vida es Un Mus)
Brand new single from this deservedly-hyped band. Two songs that
definitely carry on the Hoax style. "Sick Punk" is perhaps a little
different, with more of an SSD vibe than anything I've heard from the
band before. I do wish these songs had been infused with some of those
wild Randy Uchida leads that pop once or twice per Hoax record, but
these two anthems will keep the pit moving just fine.

Perspex Flesh: Ona 7" (Video Disease)
Debut 7" from this Leeds HC band, and it's a bit different than their
demo, which I remember as being a pretty straight-up noisy HC affair.
These songs slow down the tempo, introducing a mid-paced, lurching
quality and adding some really catchy, simple, and dark lead guitar.
It actually reminds me quite a bit of the most recent Salvation EP on
Youth Attack (and, by extension, a little bit of Samhain as well), but
with a less outsider / artsy vibe. Comparisons aside, this is some
dark, catchy hardcore that fans of Hoax in particular should
definitely check out.

Absurdo: Tots Sants 7" (Discos Absurds)
Debut EP from this Barcelona band who had a pretty cool demo a couple
of years ago. Paco at La Vida Es Un Mus described this as "Teen Idles
meets Anti-Dogmatikks," which I think pretty much sums it up
perfectly. Absurdo have the straightforward, almost naive sound of the
former fused with the wild, raw energy of the latter (this quality
also recalling early Italian HC). Basically, it's the best of both
worlds... wild, frenetic hardcore with little catchy parts that stick
to your ribs. Fans of Wretched, Void, and similarly warped-but-catchy
HC take note. Oh, and for those of you with an enlightened
appreciation of the physical object, these come with absolutely
stunning screen-printed jackets.

Stoic Violence: S/T 12" (Video Disease)
Well, usually it's considered a bit gauche to move straight from demo
to LP, but LA's State Violence get a pass 1. because the band is
composed of a bunch of all-stars who have been around the block a few
times, and 2. because this absolutely RIPS! Perfect, fist-pumping
hardcore with no pretense or gimmicks. For the music, the comparison I
can't seem to get out of my head is Bad Posture... like that band,
Stoic Violence tend to play in this perfect in-the-pocket tempo that
makes you want to bang your head and/or shake your fist, but they
aren't also afraid to add in a few ripping fast parts (or occasionally
entire songs) for emphasis and/or variety. The vocals, on the other
hand, remind me of Chris Erba from H100s / Avon Ladies... they're at
the same time unhinged, discernible, and catchy. This is absolutely
top shelf hardcore right here... whether you're a shut-in who spends
all of his or her time playing original copies of classic USHC 7"s in
your basement, or if you're a newfangled internet hoax_fan, you'll
almost certainly dig this. Highly recommended.

Straightjacket Nation: Live on PBS 12" (No Patience)
I've always been a huge fan of live-on-the-radio sets from punk
bands... it's like the best parts of the studio performance and the
live show, and this definitely leads me to hold on to that assumption,
because it's probably the best Straightjacket Nation record I've
heard. They've always repped Cleveland bands super hard, but I've
never really heard it in their sound so much as I do on this release.
This seriously sounds like the product of a one-off H100s / Gordon
Solie collaboration LP, and aside from the vox being slightly low in
the mix the recording is as big and powerful as you would expect from
any HC band's studio recordings. Definitely not some throwaway live
record... if you dig SJN you need this.

Parquet Courts: Light Up Gold 12" (What's Your Rupture)
Latest LP offering from What's Your Rupture?, the label that brought
us, among other things, US pressings of stand-out full-lengths by
Iceage and Royal Headache. As those releases indicate, Kevin at WYR?
has a great ear for records that seem to both embody and transcend the
punk scene... records that you could imagine your little sister
getting into, but that you can still hang with because they're
definitely still punk. Parquet Courts definitely fits that mold, as
they play an instantly-catchy kind of driving, simple, and poppy music
that almost seems like an empty vessel into which critics and people
like me can throw in references. As for me, I definitely hear a lot of
Chairs Missing-era Wire (though the songs tend to be more upbeat),
early Feelies (though less obtuse), early Pavement (though not as
artsy), and even Neu! (though of course that reference doesn't capture
the instantly-memorable vocals). Ultimately, this strikes me as its
own thing, the kind of record that you'll hear people blatantly
ripping off in years to come. As for me, I'm completely in love with
it, and if you like good music and your tastes are adventurous enough
to include the bands mentioned above, I venture to say that you will
love this album too.

Sad Boys: S/T 7" (Toxic State)
Debut 7" from this NYC band playing super catchy pogo punk. Along
with Who Killed Spikey Jacket?, Sad Boys are bringing back the sound
of simple dunka-dunka beats, 4-chord riffs, and bright and catchy
melodies, and while two or three years ago a band playing this sound
would have been laughed off the stage nowadays it sounds super fresh
and fun (especially next to all of the po-faced, self-hating HC bands
out there). More than just a sound, though, Sad Boys write super
catchy songs, and the awesome Comes-style vocals sound killer as well.
Also, this is on Toxic State, so of course you get absolutely
top-notch packaging as well.

Altered Boys: S/T 7" (Katorga Works)
Debut EP from this New Jersey hardcore band. Definitely in keeping
with the rougher, meaner Katorga Works releases from bands like Hounds
of Hate and Creem, Altered Boys play straight up, rugged, no-nonsense
hardcore. The songs are solid and straightforward, and there's no fat
or weirdness... just bruising hardcore. BTW, Altered Boys are
ex-Wormeaters, so if there are any fans of their Wardeath EP (one of
the most underrated Sorry State releases in my opinion) you may want
to pick this up.

Rational Animals: Cross Eyed Delights 7" (Katorga Works)
Final single from this upstate NY band. The a-side here, much like
their singles club record for Cowabunga, is a real rocking, grungy
kind of song with hooks galore. It's about a million miles from their
earlier, jammier Black Flag-worshipping stuff, and honestly I like it
a lot better. As for the b-side, it's a total Loose Nut-style bluesy
dirge that will please the old fans.

CCR Headcleaner: S/T 7" (Caesar Cuts)
Vinyl debut from this noisy Oakland band. These guys play energetic,
punky pop with swirling, heaving layers of distortion... the kind of
thing that, if it were from Olympia, would almost certainly come out
on Perennial Records. There's definitely due diligence paid to the
classics of 80s indie rock (Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr, et al), but the
songs are energetic and punkier here than one might think given those
references. Fans of Milk Music, Son Skull, and the early Men stuff
should definitely check this out.

Dads: Brown on Brown 12" (Wharf Cat)
Latest 12" from this Florida band that seems to be yet another
creative outlet for members of Merchandise, among others. Apparently
the band has embraced a couple of different sounds over the course of
their several releases, but on this LP, at least, they remind me of a
much rawer and more punk version of early PIL. Like PIL's first few
records, Dads have this way of balancing almost willfully obtuse
riffing with insistent, danceable grooves... PIL kind of summed it up
perfectly in the title of their song "Death Disco." Really, it's not
terribly unlike Merchandise, but replace that band's kind of wistful
vibes with something darker and druggier and you have Dads.

The Capitalist Kids: Lessons on Love, Sharing, and Hygiene 12" (Toxic
Pop)
Killer pop-punk from this Austin, TX band. Yeah, it's maybe a little
bit on the syrupy side compared to the kind of stuff I usually carry,
but you really can't deny hooks like these. This is like the perfect
mix of Lookout!-era Green Day and the early Lillingtons stuff, though
in places it also reminds me of Tenement's most straightforward
material. In other words, it's definitely Ramones-influenced and has
that big guitar sound, but the melodies are a little more complex and
classically pop. If you're into this style of pop-punk at all you
definitely need to check this band out.

Paper Dragons: Die to Please 12" (Firestarter)
Debut 12" from this Baltimore band featuring members of a heap of
well-known groups like Pulling Teeth, Deep Sleep, the Spark, Dead
Mechanical, and many others. Deep Sleep is probably the best
comparison to Paper Dragons' sound; like DS, Paper Dragons exist on
the catchier / more melodic end of the hardcore spectrum, but they
dispense with the All-isms of Deep Sleep. The label description calls
it "Circle Jerks meets the Wipers," and I can definitely see that, as
there's a locked-in, driving quality that definitely recalls the
Wipers. Perhaps the perfect modern reference would be demo-era
Cloak/Dagger. At any rate, this is a killer album of hooky, driving
hardcore punk.

Quailbones / Happy Forever: Split cassette (Ghost Orchard)
One side of this cassette comprises the latest material from Murray,
Kentucky's Quailbones. If you caught a copy of their criminally
limited (100 copies!) 7", you know that they play lush, exquisite, and
densely-layered post-punk with a pop edge. Fans of Whatever Brains
will definitely be interested, though Quailbones have a more
straightforward vocal approach that doesn't take as much getting used
to. These tracks, however, are super raw (live / rehearsal
recordings?), yet the hooks and intricacies still shine through. As
for Happy Forever, I don't know much about them, but they're really a
perfect pairing for Quailbones, as they have a similarly eclectic
approach with lots of lush instrumentation and pop melody, though some
added Velvets influence. At any rate, this is a killer split chock
full of music from two great bands.

Psychic Blood: Autumn Curses cassette (self-released)
Cassette-only album from this New England noise rock / post-punk /
indie band. First of all, the band has has several previous
cassette-only releases, but they're presenting this one as their debut
full-length rather than just another demo. It's definitely a lengthy
and fully-realized collection of songs, even if the recording itself
is still a bit on the raw side. As for the sound, they definitely have
more than a little bit in common with the almighty Shoppers. Like that
band, when you first hear them you think it's just going to be
straight-up Daydream Nation-era Sonic Youth worship, but the record
quickly reveals itself to be much more than that. Hooks abound and
come from unlikely places, and there's a driving punk energy that
separates this from the gloomy, directionless plod that some similar
bands can fall into. Fans of Shoppers, Panzram, Merchandise, Neon
Blud, et al should definitely check this one out.

Hi everyone! It's March and I'm back with another Sorry State Records =
label / distro update. Things are coming along swimmingly with the next =
couple of releases. Test pressings have been approved for the Manipulation =
and Sickoids 12"s, art has been finalized and now it's just a waiting game =
until these are released sometime in the vicinity of April Fool's Day. In =
the meantime, re-acquaint yourself with the preview tracks from these two =
ragers:<br><br>
<iframe width=3D"100%" height=3D"166" scrolling=3D"no" frameborder=3D"no" =
src=3D"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.=
com%2Ftracks%2F78157685"></iframe><br><br>
<iframe width=3D"100%" height=3D"166" scrolling=3D"no" frameborder=3D"no" =
src=3D"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.=
com%2Ftracks%2F78157326"></iframe><br><br>
Things are also coming along with the upcoming Whatever Brains 3rd album. =
The record has been mastered by Josh Bonati, and the next steps are to cut =
a lacquer and to get together some artwork. The band continue to work on =
their rock opera and have been playing some absolutely scorching shows =
around North Carolina. Speaking of raging Whatever Brains shows, they're =
playing another one later this month with Neo-Cons from San Francisco. =
Also appearing will be N&Oslash;L&hearts;VE (my new band... the funky =
typography is both in allegiance to our be&ne;'d North Carolinan brethren =
and to differentiate us from the Bay Area HC band called No Love) and the =
premiere of Double Negative's new lineup with drummer Connor Donnegan =
(Last Words, Lung Matter, Abuse, etc.). Connor is a really incredible =
drummer, and based on the couple of practices I've dropped in on, DN won't =
lose a step.<br><br>
Also in the works are the upcoming sophomore 12"s from Joint D&ne; and =
Brain F&ne;. The Brain F&ne; LP now has a title, <i>Empty Set</i>, and the =
Joint D&ne; now has a final mix that is straight up banging! I'm super =
excited about both of these, and hopefully we can have them out sometime =
late spring / early summer.<br><br>
A little bit further in the future, we'll have new records from Libyans =
(this one is already recorded and currently being mixed... I haven't heard =
anything yet, but Liz tells me it's got some real hits) and Dark Ages =
(I've heard some four-track demos and they're really exciting... darker =
and more complex, but with the intricate songwriting you've come to =
expect), and maybe some other surprises too.<br><br>
<font color=3D"red">Note for international customers</font>: I know that =
the recent shipping hikes have hit you folks pretty hard, and I came up =
with a couple of things I can do to help. First, I can consolidate =
multiple orders so that you can reserve records as they're added to the =
web site and have them shipped only when you have enough to fill a large =
parcel. Second, you can have your orders from other distros, ebay sellers, =
etc. shipped to me and I can combine them with your Sorry State orders. If =
you're interested in either of these options just shoot me an email to =
learn more.<br><br>
Finally, I'm not sure how many of you keep up with Sorry State's social =
network profiles, but following the label on Facebook and Twitter will =
keep you up to date on all of the new stuff coming through the distro, =
since I always post right when I add things to the web site. Lately I've =
also been doing some extra-curricular posting on Twitter, mostly just =
pithy little musings about what I'm listening to or what's going on in =
punk. If you're interested in that at all you can follow me =
@sorrystate.<br><br>
As for the distro, I'm continuing to add great new records every couple of =
days. My personal favorites this month are the new Prank releases, the =
Stoic Violence 12", the Cola Freaks / Secret Prostitutes split LP, the =
Violent Future 7", the Avon Ladies 7", the new Ice Age LP, the Parquet =
Courts LP (sadly out of stock at the moment), the <i>Land of Nod</i> comp =
LP, and that Noose EP. That's just my personal favorites though, and the =
absolute cream of the crop. It's kind of ridiculous how many great records =
I added this month. I also restocked a ton of killer records like the =
Boston Strangler LP, the Crazy Spirit and Hank Wood LPs, a bunch of recent =
Prank Records releases, nearly every recent Ugly Pop release (and check =
out their latest two reissues while you're at it!), and many, many others. =
Check out the full list below.

align=3D"right" style=3D"padding-left: 5px" width=3D"175">
Her&auml;tys: <i>N&auml;en Punaista</i> 7" (Prank)<br>
FINALLY, the US pressing of the swan song by this much-missed Swedish =
band. They still have two distinct north and south poles--Totalit&auml;r =
and Skitkids--that they waver in between... about half the songs on this =
record sound just like they could have come from <i>Sin Egan =
Motstandare</i> and the other half add in a little rocked-out guitar a la =
the Skitkids' later stuff. It's all absolutely brilliant and raging... a =
real rampaging EP. Highly recommended.<br><br>
<img border=3D0 height=3D"175" =
src=3D"http://sorrystaterecords.com/images/effluxusdevoid.jpg" =
align=3D"left" style=3D"padding-right: 5px" width=3D"175">
Effluxus: <i>Devoid</i> 7" (Prank)<br>
Latest record from this new Bay Area project featuring members of the =
mighty Morpheme among (many) others. Indeed, there are too many =
ex-members-of to count here. The Morpheme connection is the most apparent, =
though Effluxus also remind me quite a bit of New York's Perdition in the =
way that they blend together a lot of different styles of noisy, crusty =
punk to arrive at something that is uniquely now. There are elements of =
Disclose's wall of noise, the simplicity of early Scandinavian hardcore, =
and the riff assault of more developed mid-80s stuff, all wrapped up in =
maximum aggression and songwriting skill. This also features absolutely =
gorgeous full-color art from Guillem from Destino Final. You really can't =
go wrong with this one.<br><br>
<img border=3D0 height=3D"175" =
src=3D"http://sorrystaterecords.com/images/bigeyesdemo7.jpg" =
align=3D"right" style=3D"padding-left: 5px" width=3D"175">
Big Eyes: Demo 7" (Grave Mistake / Evil Weevil)<br>
New pressing of this demo-tape-to-vinyl, and indeed this recording is =
certainly worthy of the format. Four bangers that perfectly combine the =
snotty proto-punk of the Runaways with the big hooks and melodies of 90s =
indie rock and melodic punk. It sounds like a weird mix when you describe =
it, but Big Eyes are really their own thing, and it's crazy that they =
emerged this fully-formed. If you have liked any of the band's other stuff =
you definitely need to pick this up too.<br><br>
<img border=3D0 height=3D"175" =
src=3D"http://sorrystaterecords.com/images/villagepistolsbigmoney.jpg" =
align=3D"left" style=3D"padding-right: 5px" width=3D"175">
Village Pistols: <i>Big Money</i> 7" (Last Laugh)<br>
Exacting repro of North Carolina's most substantial offering in the =
vintage KBD sweepstakes. As a proud North Carolinian, I'm obviously very =
attached to the a-side here, but it really is like the best track that =
Dangerhouse never released, sounding uncannily like the Rhino 39 and Dils =
records on that label, but even faster and more furious. As for the flip, =
it's an utter deconstruction of "Strawberry Fields Forever" that somehow =
manages to retain the Dangerhouse vibe, but this time there's a lot more =
Black Randy in the mix. Any way you slice it this is a true KBD =
scorcher.<br><br>
<img border=3D0 height=3D"175" =
src=3D"http://sorrystaterecords.com/images/cartoonshesarockandroller.JPG" =
align=3D"right" style=3D"padding-left: 5px" width=3D"175">
The Cartoons: <i>She's a Rock and Roller</i> 7" (Last Laugh)<br>
Exacting repro of the one release by this obscure 70s New York punk band. =
The a-side is a really epic song... stylistically, it's somewhere between =
the Heartbreakers and more '77 UK-influenced stuff, but it has this really =
great buildup at the end that sounds unlike anything else I can really =
think of. As for the b-side, it's a super catchy track that could have =
come right off of <i>LAMF</i> with its snotty, raunchy rhythm guitar and =
hooky vox. Another KBD killer back in print courtesy of Last =
Laugh.<br><br>
<img border=3D0 height=3D"175" src=3D"http://sorrystaterecords.com/images/=
endlessgrinningskullsfearignorance.jpg" align=3D"left" =
style=3D"padding-right: 5px" width=3D"175">
Endless Grinning Skulls: <i>Fear, Ignorance, Control</i> 7" (Viral =
Age)<br>
Latest 7" from this burly UK band. As I said in my description of their =
earlier 12", EGS seems like a consummate "old guy hardcore" band. I don't =
mean that as a slight in any way... rather, it's a compliment. There's =
something distinctive about the sound of bands full of folks who have been =
around the block a few times, and EGS definitely have it. They also have =
an absolutely bruising sound and anger to spare. If you're into raw, angry =
hardcore from Doom to Vorhees to Out Cold you'll love this... seriously =
top-shelf stuff.<br><br>
<img border=3D0 height=3D"175" =
src=3D"http://sorrystaterecords.com/images/tranzmitorsiseethewriting.jpg" =
align=3D"right" style=3D"padding-left: 5px" width=3D"175">
Tranzmitors: <i>I See the Writing on the Wall</i> 7" (React!)<br>
Latest single from this Canadian band who had a huge buzz a few years ago, =
but have fallen off my radar as of late. I'm not sure if they're still =
going, or if this is really current, but what I do know is that it =
contains two songs of top-shelf power pop in the tradition of bands like =
Protex, the Pointed Sticks, and the Undertones. The vocalist still sounds =
uncannily like early Robert Smith (the Cure), so if the above references =
pique your interests pick this up... you won't be disappointed.<br><br>
<img border=3D0 height=3D"175" =
src=3D"http://sorrystaterecords.com/images/noosewarofallagainstall.jpg" =
align=3D"left" style=3D"padding-right: 5px" width=3D"175">
Noose: <i>The War of All Against All</i> 7" (React!)<br>
The best material by this Chicago hardcore band. The lyrics are militantly =
straight edge, but the music is straight up hardcore, completely devoid of =
any sXe cliches. Noose remind me of bands like Coke Bust and Blank Stare, =
i.e. groups that rep the straight edge but are too angry to cop to any of =
the youth crew bs. This one was all over MRR's year-end top 10 lists for =
2012, and with good reason. Recommended if you like the above-mentioned =
bands, Stripmines, Oblivionation, Out Cold, etc.<br><br>
<img border=3D0 height=3D"175" =
src=3D"http://sorrystaterecords.com/images/trauma10songep.jpg" =
align=3D"right" style=3D"padding-left: 5px" width=3D"175">
Trauma: <i>10 Song EP</i> 7" (Bulkhead)<br>
Vinyl pressing of Trauma's 10-song demo tape, and while the recording is a =
little bit rawer than their 12" on Feral Ward, this is definitely worthy =
of being on vinyl. As on their LP, Trauma play blistering short, sharp =
shocks of hardcore informed by the Scandinavian classics, but with a USHC =
touch. Features members of countless bands like Tragedy, Final Warning, =
Deathreat, Criminal Damage, etc., but the most important references are =
probably Final Warning and Deathreat. 10 blistering hardcore songs =
straight out of 1982... if you dig old Euro core you really can't do any =
better than this. No cliches, no posing, just rage.<br><br>
<img border=3D0 height=3D"174" =
src=3D"http://sorrystaterecords.com/images/reallyredcrowdcontrol.jpg" =
align=3D"left" style=3D"padding-right: 5px" width=3D"175">
Really Red: <i>Crowd Control</i> 7" (bootleg)<br>
Spot-on repro of this classic Texas punk single. Really Red eventually =
evolved into a kind of quirky art-rock/hardcore band a la the Minutement =
or even the Pop Group, but for this first single they were pure anthemic =
punk in the '77 tradition, and it's fitting that "Crowd Control" has been =
comped numerous times on records like <i>Killed by Death</i> and <i>Deep =
in the Throat of Texas</i>. It really is one of the all-time great KBD =
anthems, and the moody b-side ain't no slouch either.<br><br>
<img border=3D0 height=3D"174" =
src=3D"http://sorrystaterecords.com/images/skrewdriveryouresodumb.jpg" =
align=3D"right" style=3D"padding-left: 5px" width=3D"175">
Skrewdriver: <i>You're So Dumb</i> 7" (Bootleg)<br>
Exact repro (albeit with a change in the spot color) of this '77 punk / =
pub rock classic. I know some may disagree with my decision to carry this =
record, but aside from one extremely fucked-up member who appropriated the =
name, this band has very little in common with the later era of the group. =
Musically, this is in the vein of Eddie and the Hot Rods, Dr. Feelgood, =
etc., but with the energy level absolutely through the roof... Skrewdriver =
were on a whole different level than basically any other band playing pub =
rock at the time, and while this isn't their best material it's definitely =
a ripper.<br><br>
<img border=3D0 height=3D"191" =
src=3D"http://sorrystaterecords.com/images/byanymeanstape.png" =
align=3D"left" style=3D"padding-right: 5px" width=3D"175">
Various: <i>By Any Means</i> cassette (Stay Punk / Thrillhouse)<br>
Brand new compilation of Bay Area punk bands. This is an ambitious =
endeavor, and a lot more effort has clearly gone into this cassette than =
what goes into most vinyl releases. Pro-duplicated tapes with pro-printed =
J-cards, featuring one track each from Neon Piss, Sourpatch, Synthetic ID, =
Street Eaters, Comadre, No Statik, Apogee Sound Club, Index, True Mutants, =
Hunting Party, Violent Change, Permanent Ruin, C'est Dommage, Cold =
Circuits, Saint Lorena, Daikon, Replica, Endemics, New Flesh, Huff Stuff =
Magazine, and Nasty Christmas. A range of different styles are =
represented, but all of the bands are DIY punk. A great sampler of what's =
going on in the Bay Area right now.<br><br>
<img border=3D0 height=3D"235" =
src=3D"http://sorrystaterecords.com/images/welcometothemidwestzine.jpg" =
align=3D"right" style=3D"padding-left: 5px" width=3D"175">
Welcome to the Midwest zine<br>
A bunch of midwestern zinesters getting together for a little mini-zine =
that is basically a bunch of top 10 of 2012 lists. All records / shows / =
bands / etc. get a little description, there are some rad cut-and-paste =
layouts... all in all an excellent little music zine. The styles covered =
are more or less what I tend to carry in the distro, so if you're a list =
junkie you'll eat this up.<br><br>

As Boredom Sets in Summer 2012 zine<br>
As the title states, this was released in summer 2012 and features =
interviews with Secret Prostitutes, Video, and Slugz, along with a ton of =
other writing about recent punk and hardcore. While not quite as =
"literary" as zines like Got Myself or Distort, As Boredom Sets In's =
enthusiasm carries through and makes this a chaotic but enjoyable =

As Boredom Sets in Winter 2012<br>

Various: <i>Bloodstains Across the UK</i> 12"<br>
Yet another in this long line of infamous comps. These kinds of series =
have a reputation for diminishing returns, but this volume is pretty much =
all-killer no-filler to my ears, making up in listenability what it lacks =
in obscurity. Plus, on this volume the compiler has chosen to comp entire =
EPs where the music warranted it, which definitely makes for a stronger =

and Rivals.<br><br>

Generacion Suicida: Demo 12" (Symphony of Destruction)<br>
The demo tape from this talked-about LA band pressed to 12" vinyl courtesy =
of the French label Symphony of Destruction. I believe they've cleaned up =
the sound considerably from the cassette version (which I also carried in =
the distro), and the band's dual-vocal, Gorilla Angreb / Masshysteri / =
Daylight Robbery-style melodic punk comes across a lot stronger on wax. =
Very handmade and very limited, so don't sleep.<br><br>

The Shirks: S/T 12" (Grave Mistake)<br>
Debut 12" from this Baltimore band who represent quite a different sound =
than anything Grave Mistake has done before. To my ears, this has a very =
90s garage/punk sound, reminding me of Rip Off Records-style bands =
(including, most notably, the Rip Offs themselves) as well as Japanese =
bands like Teengenerate and the Registrators. As with the best of those =
bands, the energy level here is off the charts, the production is pretty =
much piss-raw, and the hooks abound. Excellent stuff.<br><br>

Big Boys: <i>Where's My Towel / Industry Standard</i> 12" (Light in the =
Attic)<br>
Absolutely GORGEOUS reissue of this classic Big Boys 12", probably the =
hardest-to-find record in their discography save the debut "Frat Cars" 7". =
I've always thought the Big Boys were a really interesting band because =
they went on for so long and encompassed so much. They started kinda like =
KBD punk, went through a bunch of styles, embraced hardcore (ethically if =
not aesthetically) and then ended up as something totally unique, able to =
shift gears rapidly between breakneck hardcore punk and grooved-out funk. =
<I>Where's My Towel</i> is probably the band's most consistent record; at =
least, it's one of the only ones on which all of the songs sound like they =
were written by the same band. I'm guessing that the members were =
listening to lots of first-wave post-punk at this stage... I'm reminded of =
Warsaw, early Wire, the Pop Group's more tuneful moments, and in general =
the more straightforward subset of the early Rough Trade Records crowd. =
Like the best of those bands, the Big Boys could both write a hook and =
ride a groove, and they do both admirably on this release. Features a =
much-expanded version of the original layout, including an awesome =
gatefold jacket.<br><br>

Living Void: <i>Squalor</i> 12" (Crime Minister)<br>
Debut 12" from this grind / power violence band from Boston. These guys =
seem to be coming from a more metal end of things than the Infest-inspired =
PV stuff I usually carry, but the more prominent metallic influences allow =
Living Void to foray into more interesting / creative riffing as well as =
(somewhat unexpectedly) more variety and catchiness in the vocals. Some of =
the parts are also pretty much straight up death metal, which is very cool =
to hear mixed into this style. If you're a metal omnivore whose tastes =
extend to thrash, death, grind, and even a bit of hardcore give this a =
try.<br><br>

Various: <i>Land of Nod</i> 12" (Scavenger of Death)<br>
Well, if this isn't the best compilation LP to come out in the past decade =
or more, then I really don't know what is. First of all, the quality of =
the bands represented here is just astounding. Everyone knows that Atlanta =
is a hotbed of punk, and with tracks from Bukkake Boys (their final =
recordings), Ralph, Manic, GG King, Gentleman Jesse, Manic, Cops, Wymyns =
Prysyn, Shaved Christ, Predator, and even more, this record more than =
adequately makes the case, particularly since I don't think a single band =
contributes anything close to "B" material. Second, the sound of the thing =
itself is remarkably cohesive, nearly all of the tracks having been =
recorded by Ryan from Bukkake Boys / Scavenger of Death (many of them on =
the same day, in fact)... so even though the bands represented here are =
all very different, there's a similar sound that links them all together, =
making the comp run way more like a single LP than just about any other =
that I can think of. Finally, the whole package is gorgeously executed =
with a trademark Scavenger of Death design job courtesy GG King. This =
thing is pretty much just hit after hit... if you like punk you need this =
LP.<br><br>

Shrills: <i>Melt Down</i> 12" (Resurrection)<br>
Fuzzy, catchy garage-punk from this Orange County band. Way more punk than =
most of the bands who tend to get tagged with terms like "fuzz," "psych," =
or even "garage," the Shrills sound to me less Puffy Areolas and more Thee =
Oh Sees / Hunches. In other words, there's a 60s influence, but the basis =
is catchy, upbeat punk.<br><br>

Outer Minds: <i>Behind the Mirror</i> 12" (Resurrection)<br>
2nd LP from this Chicago band (their first was on Southpaw) who play =
incredibly authentic 60s psychedelic rock / pop. It really is amazing how =
fully this evokes the classics... in particular, I can't stop thinking of =
that Masters Apprentices single that Ugly Pop reissued a while back, =
though the more obvious influences would be the more rockin' / American =
end of the 60s psych sound. Great songwriting throughout... this will =
definitely scratch your retro psych itch.<br><br>

Funerary Box: <i>Hell-Hammered Horror</i> 12" (Rescued from Life)<br>
Latest 12" from this cult metal band. As if it weren't obvious from the =
record's title, the influences here are primarily from the international =
scene of raw metal that so influenced the first generation of black metal =
bands... think Hellhammer, Venom, Sarcofago, Impetigo, etc. This =
definitely has its own unique thing going on... the vocals are a little =
death-ier than I associate with the style, and the music can swing back =
and forth between primitive Hellhammer-esque bashing and a slightly more =
rocking, Venom-inspired sound, but the whole thing is raw, mean, and very =
dark. They even finish things off with a blistering Rolling Stones =
cover... didn't see that one coming, did you?<br><br>

The Kick: S/T 12" (Static Age)<br>
Compilation of studio sessions by this 70s Swiss punk/post-punk band. If =
you know that this band is a 70s Swiss post-punk band with a lady singer =
(not sure of the genders of the other members), you're probably already =
preparing yourself for a Kleenex reference, but honestly that's really not =
appropriate at all. The Kick are definitely way more polished and pop than =
that. It isn't just that they can really play, it's that they really do =
sound like they take a lot of influence from the more radio-friendly (at =
least in the UK) end of the post-punk sound... bands like the Cure, =
Siouxsie (whom the singer sounds quite like at times), etc. As those =
references indicate, this has a bit of a dark / goth vibe, but it also =
still feels really punk... given the attention given to bands like =
Belgrado recently, I could see people really flipping out for this =
band.<br><br>

Wake Up Dead: <i>Northern Girls</i> 7" (EZPZ)<br>
Latest 3-song single from this London band featuring members of Black =
Time, Black Mamba Beat, and Live Fast Die, among many others. These three =
songs remind me a lot of the best guitar-driven, poppy post-punk / new =
wave of the early 80s... I'm thinking of bands like the Soft Boys, the =
Sound, and maybe even early Kiwi stuff like Clean, though this is much =
more raw and DIY sounding than any of those bands. There's also a slight =
bit of that druggy / 70s New York kind of vibe that I get off of some Pink =
Reason stuff. At root, though, these are three insanely catchy, =
well-written songs delivered with raw punk energy... what's not to =
like?<br><br>

Pointed Sticks: <i>What Do You Want Me to Do?</i> 7" (Ugly Pop)<br>
Yes, another late 70s Canadian punk smasher from Ugly Pop! This time it's =
a personal favorite, the debut single from Pointed Sticks, originally =
released by Quintessence Records in 1978. If you don't know the Sticks, =
along with Teenage Head they were probably the best-known of Canada's '77 =
set, though they definitely had more of a poppy / new wave-ish sound than =
similar American bands. This would fit in extremely well with stuff like =
Elvis Costello, Wreckless Eric, Protex, the Speedies, etc. Later on in =
their career they would get a little bit too syrupy for my tastes (the =
production on some of their later stuff also left a bit to be desired), =
but this debut single is the band at their rawest, most energetic, and =
most punk. If you dig stuff like the aforementioned bands or even more =
obscure stuff like the Nasty Facts, do yourself a favor and pick this up. =
A total banger. (Note: the reissue has a blue cover, unlike the pink one =
pictured)<br><br>

The Bureaucrats: <i>Feel the Pain</i> 7" (Ugly Pop)<br>
Ugly Pop does it again! I'd actually never heard this 1978 single by the =
Bureaucrats, but man is it a banger! It has that perfect, poppy 70s punk =
sound that I will love until my dying day... fans of Protex, the Jam, the =
Undertones, and other bands that combined a huge guitar sound with punk =
energy and instantly-memorable vocal hooks will flip for this. I hope I =
never run out of incredible singles like this to discover... wow.<br><br>

Dime Runner: <i>Race to Nowhere</i> cassette (Resurrection)<br>
Cassette-only album from this punk band from Fullerton, California. These =
guys are definitely of a piece with a lot of what was happening in the =
late 90s OC / Fullerton scene, sounding quite a bit like the Stitches, =
Smogtown, etc. In other words, it's tough, three-chord punk influenced by =
the British classics, maybe with a bit of Thunders guitar thrown in and =
some KBD snottiness in the vox.<br><br>

Predator: S/T cassette (Scavenger of Death)<br>
Compilation of studio material by this long-running Atlanta band. Predator =
started life as the Frantic, had a really killer, underrated LP that =
sounded kind of like the Zero Boys, and then morphed into Predator and =
went on to release an LP on Rob's House several years ago that pretty much =
went totally under the radar (in fact, as of this writing I still have =
copies in the distro if you're looking). They've been pretty quiet on the =
vinyl front since then. If you haven't hit a show in Atlanta you could =
probably be forgiven for thinking the band broke up, but they've been =
playing sporadically the whole time, evolving concurrently with related =
bands like GG King, Beat Beat Beat, Cops, Gentleman Jesse, etc. This =
pro-duplicated cassette collects 15 songs from various recording sessions, =
and if you follow Atlanta punk this is pretty essential stuff... if you =
play your records by GG King, Cops, etc., you should definitely pick this =
up as well.<br><br>

Wymyns Prysyn: 2nd 7" (Pygmy)<br>
2nd EP from this Atlanta band who play killer, catchy punk with some =
post-punk tendencies. I suppose it's not a million miles away from what =
one thinks of as the "Atlanta sound" (i.e. Carbonas / Beat Beat Beat), but =
rather than basing things off a classic pop template, this one seems to =
come from a more artsy / deliberate direction. In the end it's just as =
catchy, but the catchy seems to be from somewhere else... it's almost like =
these are early New Order songs played at blistering, near-hardcore =
tempos, but then again it also reminds me of the punkier end of 90s =
British rock... Supergrass maybe? Or maybe China Drum... I'm stumped! =
Regardless, this is a really stellar EP... strongly recommended. Limited =
to 300 copies with screen printed jackets.<br><br>

Archival release from this extremely obscure '77 punk band from Santa =

faithful to the original except that it's played at nearly double speed... =
the energy level is really through the roof here. As for the flip, it's an =
original with a similar set of influences, but a little more traditionally =
"punk" sounding. Fans of the Plugz or the Nuns will definitely be digging =
this. Cool packaging, too, including a die-cut jacket, color vinyl, and a =

Vinyl release of the first studio recording by this first-gen Detroit =

in with the early Dischord / Touch and Go crowd... perfect raw, aggressive =
production, awesomely simple, direct, and catchy songwriting, and really =
just everything you love about early 80s hardcore. If you still get =
mileage out of classics by SOA, the Teen Idles, and the early Necros stuff =
you definitely want this. The packaging is also stellar, too... this is =

Raw Nerve: <i>Head Trauma: The Final Raw Nerve Tour</i> DVD<br>
Man, am I stoked about this thing. With the technology to record and edit =
video becoming so cheap and easy to use, I've been wondering why there =
haven't been more DIY / punk video projects, and here comes this bad boy =
to fill the void. The centerpiece here is a short (not sure of the exact =
running time, but I'd guess 30-40 minutes) documentary about the final run =
of Raw Nerve shows. The documentary is extremely well-produced, =
interesting, and well-paced. Honestly, I've seen "professional" punk =
documentaries (like the recent Circle Jerks doc, for instance) that are =
far less polished and a hell of a lot less fun to watch. If you're a fan =
of Raw Nerve (and why wouldn't you be? They're one of the best hardcore =
bands of the past decade) you definitely want this. The DVD is also packed =

Debut LP from this garage-punk band from Kobe, Japan. The label =
description references Teengenerate, the Registrators, and Guitar Wolf, =
and those are pretty much the exact same reference points I would have =
made... a lot of bands go for this sort of punk-infused retro garage =
sound, but very few can match the insane, over-the-top energy of =
Teengenerate's best stuff. The Mighty Fevers, however, do... if you crave =
that patented combination of blown-out-guitar, big vocal hooks, and =
over-the-top frantic energy (or if you just like punk played so fast and =

Agent Orange: <i>Living in Darkness</i> 12" (Drastic Plastic)<br>
Brand new pressing of one of my all-time favorites. Though they're often =
lumped in with other early 80s SoCal punk bands like the Adolescents and =
TSOL, Agent Orange had an utterly unique sound. Sure, they relied a bit =
more heavily on surfy guitar than most bands and they covered "Pipeline," =
but they're more than just the OG "surf punk" band. They're a band with an =
utterly unique songwriting style and vibe, writing melodies as memorable =
as anything Cock Sparrer ever did while creating as strong a vibe as the =
early Joy Division or Bauhaus records. If you haven't heard this record, I =
highly encourage you to pick up this extremely nice edition with new =
mastering and color vinyl... it's a fitting way to preserve one of the =
most unique and powerful LPs in the history of punk.<br><br>

Yet more vinyl output from the modern-day Boston Crew... this time around =

Eraser laying down some straight-up bruising hardcore. SSD is the obvious =
influence, and there are none of the Infest-inspired / power violence =

Iceage: <i>You're Nothing</i> 12" (Matador)<br>
2nd LP from this band of Danish youngsters. I always kind of wondered if =
their first album was a fluke... on that record, it almost sounded like =
they wanted to be a hardcore band, but didn't quite get it right and ended =
up with something much more interesting. On this LP, however, it's clear =
that the band, in fact, have an extremely deliberate and original voice. =
Both the songs and the overall "vibe" of the record here are truly =
outstanding... really like nothing else I've ever heard in my life, and =
not only is it singular, but compelling as well.
There's a reason why bands like Iceage, F***ed Up, and Ceremony get signed =
to big indie labels like Matador; it's because they have an utterly unique =
voice and are making genuinely new and exciting music. If you come to =
records just wanting to hear an established sound done well, then you're =
going to hate this record. If, however, you want each record in your =
collection to be special, to have a sound like no other, and further if =
you like music to surprise you, then you absolutely much hear this. And, =
of course, if you liked <i>New Brigade</i> then you absolutely need to =

Repressing of this classic grind / power violence record. Originally =

violence that I associate most strongly with Spazz's early stuff. Like =

Collection of demos from this mid-90s Boston hardcore/punk band. I =
remember when these guys were around... I never really paid them much =
mind, but apparently the band--and these recordings in particular--are =
held in very high regard by Boston folk. Listening to this record today, I =
can definitely hear why. In fact, it still sounds surprisingly fresh. The =
most obvious point of comparison is Swiz; like that band, Get High takes =
post-hardcore instrumentation (particularly the more delicate/complex =
riffing style) and grafts it onto a more energetic, classic punk/hardcore =
template. The singer even sounds a bit like Shawn Brown. Limited to 289 =

features interviews with Need, School Shootings, Herpes, Fumes, Salvation, =
and Goosebumps, along with a ton of other writing on related and similar =
zines, records, etc. With 46 full-size pages this will sustain you through =
quite a few bathroom visits, but more important than the quantity is the =
quality. Sam is one of those people who can write about hardcore in a way =
that perfectly suits the music... unlike people like me (and the vast =
majority of, say, MRR reviewers, for instance) who listen to things once =
and hastily type up a description, you can tell that Sam really listens to =
thinks closely, lets them percolate, and appreciates the overall =
experience of listening to the music. With the aforementioned style of =
hardcore, this is often an uncomfortable and violent experience, and that =
definitely comes through. Still, this isn't abstract poetry, they're =
record reviews and band interviews, but done with thought, care, and =
attention to detail that are incredibly rare. As for as zines go, this is =
without a doubt one of the best ones going.<br><br>

Avon Ladies: 2nd 7" (Fashionable Idiots / Distort)<br>
Avon Ladies... man, what a band! I was lucky enough to catch them live a =
handful of times last summer, and they were genuinely one of the most =
exciting, dangerous, and thrilling live bands that I've ever seen. I liked =
the band based on their earlier 7" on Katorga Works, but I became =
downright obsessed with them after seeing them live, and was extremely sad =
to hear that they'd broken up only a few months later. Ultimately, I think =
that the raw, chaotic power of the band's live set was best caught on the =
rehearsal recordings they released on limited cassettes (you may have =
picked up copies at Chaos in Tejas 2012), but their records remain =
indispensable documents. In particular, I'm beyond stoked to finally have =
a studio version of "Candy Sex," which has one of the most undeniable =
riffs I've heard in years and a mega-catchy chorus to boot. Absolutely =
essential.<br><br>

Grabbies: Live 7" (Fashionable Idiots / Distort)<br>
Re-release of this notorious document, which was originally released in a =
tiny edition of 200 copies years ago, and has been prized by collectors =
ever since. The Grabbies were a San Francisco punk band led by Italian =
troublemaker Alessandro / Anus, who would go on to front Fashionable Idiot =
faves Out with the Bang a few years later. This record is a soundboard =
recording from the band's one and only tour, and it's pretty much a 100% =
authentic document of what it's like to see one of Alessandro's bands =
live. There's lots of cursing, some insanely hilarious crowd baiting, and =
wedged in there somewhere are a handful of tracks of raw, abrasive =
hardcore punk. Whether you're coming to this for the stage banter or the =
music, you'll be pleased, so just get it, m'kay?<br><br>

Wild Child: Demo 7" (Fashionable Idiots)<br>
Demo tape pressed to vinyl from this Minneapolis band. Man, these guys =
have a really cool and unique sound that I can't pinpoint. The label =
description mentions both the Germs and This Is Boston Not LA, and I can =
hear either/or more on some songs than others. I also hear a lot of other =
early Dangerhouse punk like the Dils and Rhino 39, since this has a thin, =
scratchy guitar sound but is also catchy and full of aggression. It's =
really refreshing to hear a band that doesn't know precisely what subgenre =
they fit into, but are just going for it and making really aggressive, =
passionate music that is catchy and memorable. Those who like old stuff =
will definitely dig this, but it's definitely not a retro record. So, I =
guess if you like any of the aforementioned bands give this a try, but be =
ready for the record to surprise you.<br><br>

Suspect: Demo cassette (Paranoid Futures)<br>
Demo tape from this new LA hardcore band featuring members of Tear It Up, =
Rough Kids, and Deep Sleep, among many others. This is one of those bands =
that seems to have jumped right out of the gate with a fully-formed and =
distinctive sound, which I guess is unsurprising given the members' =
veteran status. Of the above-mentioned bands, the one that Suspect sounds =
the most like is Tear It Up... they have the same stripped-down, =
aggressive yet catchy vibe, but there's a lot more happening as well. For =
one, Nick from Deep Sleep provides some really killer leads that are =
mega-catchy without being wanky or overtly melodic, and the songwriting in =
general is tight and memorable. With such great songs, strong production, =
and killer artwork I'd bet this will be a sought-after demo sooner rather =
than later.<br><br>

Violent Future: S/T 7" (Slasher)<br>
After an earlier demo-put-to-vinyl, here's the proper debut 7" from =
Toronto's Violent Future, and HOLY CRAP does it rage. This is total =
knuckle-dragging skinhead hardcore that sparks feelings of violence even =
in me. The songs crawl along at a menacing pace until the last track, "War =
on the Streets," which drops the tempo even further and just erupts in =
complete violence. If you dig 86 Mentality, Urban Blight, or the classics =
like Negative Approach and Blitz, don't sleep on this... a GREAT debut. =
Totally killer packaging as well, with a 2-color print on recycled stock =
jackets.<br><br>

largely in line with the early F***ed Up material, but listening back to =
this a few years later I feel like there's a distinct crossover vibe. It =
reminds me quite a bit of the Acc&uuml;sed or <i>Dealing with It</i>-era =

War Emblem: demo cassette (self-released)<br>
Demo tape from this Philadelphia band with a really energetic sound. At =
first they sound like a super energetic crust band, reminding me a lot of =
Brain Killer's more straightforward and explosive material, but the beefy =
production and more metallic parts betray a wider set of influences. In =
particular, lots of songs have these mid-paced breakdown parts that remind =
me of 90s metallic hardcore, i.e. stuff that seemed influenced in equal =
parts by the Cro-Mags and early Metallica (they can also occasionally =
sound like early Converge or Coalesce, but don't let that scare you!). So, =
I guess you could call this crusty, metallic hardcore, but it's a lot more =
interesting, energetic, and inventive than bands that typically get that =
description. If a label like Southern Lord latched onto this I could see =
it getting huge, as it's original, aggressive, and instantly appealing. A =
really killer demo.<br><br>

Cola Freaks / Secret Prostitutes: Split 12" (Bad Hair Life)<br>
Wow, what a pair-up! First up are the almighty Secret Prostitutes, one of =
the most unique and notorious bands in the current punk scene, dishing out =
seven more blasts of their simple, catchy punk. I hesitate to call what =
they're doing a formula--since when you actually listen closely, the songs =
are all quite unique and different from one another--but they definitely =
have a distinctive sound, one built around a muscular rhythm section, =
simple and melodic guitar that recalls classics like Asta Kask or even the =
Toy Dolls, and the oh-so-unique vocals, which are some of the most =
distinctive and memorable to be committed to vinyl in some time. In short, =
if you already know the Secret Prostitutes you need these new tracks, and =
if you haven't heard them before this is as good a place to start as any. =
On the flip side we have the final material from Denmark's Cola Freaks. =
The Cola Freaks are, without a doubt, one of my favorite bands of the past =
decade or so, and I was really sad to hear they broke up. All the more so, =
as this material definitely hints at some growth since their last LP for =
Rob's House Records. The first two songs sound almost like they could have =
come from that LP--nervous, agitated garage rock with super catchy vocals. =
However, the 3rd track "Om Jeg Kan Lide Det?" is probably the most melodic =
thing the band ever did, almost recalling the Marked Men with its =
mega-catchy chorus, and the last song, "Had for Had," is a droning, =
repetitive song that recalls the early Fall, a direction that I'm =
surprised the Cola Freaks didn't explore sooner. Like all of the Secret =
Prostitutes records, this is pretty darn limited (only 1,000 copies, but =
the bulk of them went to Europe), and with the added incentive of this =
being the last Cola Freaks material I don't expect this one to hang around =
long. However, if you follow either of these great bands (you should be =
following both!) you really need this split LP.<br><br>

Sauna Youth: <i>False Jesii Pt. II b/w Oh Joel</i> 7" (Static Shock)<br>
Latest single from this English band, and its quite different than any of =
their previous material. Their early stuff seemed, to me at least, to be =
pretty heavily indebted to the S***ty Limits, but this is just straight =
up, harmony-drenched DIY indie-pop. C86 references are obligatory, and =
dare I say warranted. The a-side is actually a Pissed Jeans cover =
(completely re-imagined, naturally), while the flip side is a similarly =
fetching original. Static Shock Records never steers us wrong, and if you =
dig the sound of bands like the Shop Assistants you'll flip out for =
this... great record.<br><br>

Hoax: <i>Caged b/w Sick Punk</i> 7" (La Vida es Un Mus)<br>
Brand new single from this deservedly-hyped band. Two songs that =
definitely carry on the Hoax style. "Sick Punk" is perhaps a little =
different, with more of an SSD vibe than anything I've heard from the band =
before. I do wish these songs had been infused with some of those wild =
Randy Uchida leads that pop once or twice per Hoax record, but these two =
anthems will keep the pit moving just fine.<br><br>

Perspex Flesh: <i>Ona</i> 7" (Video Disease)<br>
Debut 7" from this Leeds HC band, and it's a bit different than their =
demo, which I remember as being a pretty straight-up noisy HC affair. =
These songs slow down the tempo, introducing a mid-paced, lurching quality =
and adding some really catchy, simple, and dark lead guitar. It actually =
reminds me quite a bit of the most recent Salvation EP on Youth Attack =
(and, by extension, a little bit of Samhain as well), but with a less =
outsider / artsy vibe. Comparisons aside, this is some dark, catchy =
hardcore that fans of Hoax in particular should definitely check =
out.<br><br>

Absurdo: <i>Tots Sants</i> 7" (Discos Absurds)<br>
Debut EP from this Barcelona band who had a pretty cool demo a couple of =
years ago. Paco at La Vida Es Un Mus described this as "Teen Idles meets =
Anti-Dogmatikks," which I think pretty much sums it up perfectly. Absurdo =
have the straightforward, almost naive sound of the former fused with the =
wild, raw energy of the latter (this quality also recalling early Italian =
HC). Basically, it's the best of both worlds... wild, frenetic hardcore =
with little catchy parts that stick to your ribs. Fans of Wretched, Void, =
and similarly warped-but-catchy HC take note. Oh, and for those of you =
with an enlightened appreciation of the physical object, these come with =
absolutely stunning screen-printed jackets.<br><br>

Stoic Violence: S/T 12" (Video Disease)<br>
Well, usually it's considered a bit gauche to move straight from demo to =
LP, but LA's State Violence get a pass 1. because the band is composed of =
a bunch of all-stars who have been around the block a few times, and 2. =
because this absolutely RIPS! Perfect, fist-pumping hardcore with no =
pretense or gimmicks. For the music, the comparison I can't seem to get =
out of my head is Bad Posture... like that band, Stoic Violence tend to =
play in this perfect in-the-pocket tempo that makes you want to bang your =
head and/or shake your fist, but they aren't also afraid to add in a few =
ripping fast parts (or occasionally entire songs) for emphasis and/or =
variety. The vocals, on the other hand, remind me of Chris Erba from H100s =
/ Avon Ladies... they're at the same time unhinged, discernible, and =
catchy. This is absolutely top shelf hardcore right here... whether you're =
a shut-in who spends all of his or her time playing original copies of =
classic USHC 7"s in your basement, or if you're a newfangled internet =
hoax_fan, you'll almost certainly dig this. Highly recommended.<br><br>

Straightjacket Nation: <i>Live on PBS</i> 12" (No Patience)<br>
I've always been a huge fan of live-on-the-radio sets from punk bands... =
it's like the best parts of the studio performance and the live show, and =
this definitely leads me to hold on to that assumption, because it's =
probably the best Straightjacket Nation record I've heard. They've always =
repped Cleveland bands super hard, but I've never really heard it in their =
sound so much as I do on this release. This seriously sounds like the =
product of a one-off H100s / Gordon Solie collaboration LP, and aside from =
the vox being slightly low in the mix the recording is as big and powerful =

Parquet Courts: <i>Light Up Gold</i> 12" (What's Your Rupture)<br>
Latest LP offering from What's Your Rupture?, the label that brought us, =
among other things, US pressings of stand-out full-lengths by Iceage and =
Royal Headache. As those releases indicate, Kevin at WYR? has a great ear =
for records that seem to both embody and transcend the punk scene... =
records that you could imagine your little sister getting into, but that =
you can still hang with because they're definitely still punk. Parquet =
Courts definitely fits that mold, as they play an instantly-catchy kind of =
driving, simple, and poppy music that almost seems like an empty vessel =
into which critics and people like me can throw in references. As for me, =
I definitely hear a lot of <i>Chairs Missing</I>-era Wire (though the =
songs tend to be more upbeat), early Feelies (though less obtuse), early =
Pavement (though not as artsy), and even Neu! (though of course that =
reference doesn't capture the instantly-memorable vocals). Ultimately, =
this strikes me as its own thing, the kind of record that you'll hear =
people blatantly ripping off in years to come. As for me, I'm completely =
in love with it, and if you like good music and your tastes are =
adventurous enough to include the bands mentioned above, I venture to say =
that you will love this album too.<br><br>

while two or three years ago a band playing this sound would have been =
laughed off the stage nowadays it sounds super fresh and fun (especially =
next to all of the po-faced, self-hating HC bands out there). More than =

Debut EP from this New Jersey hardcore band. Definitely in keeping with =

The songs are solid and straightforward, and there's no fat or =

Vinyl debut from this noisy Oakland band. These guys play energetic, punky =

and punkier here than one might think given those references. Fans of Milk =
Music, Son Skull, and the early Men stuff should definitely check this =
out.<br><br>

Dads: <i>Brown on Brown</i> 12" (Wharf Cat)<br>
Latest 12" from this Florida band that seems to be yet another creative =
outlet for members of Merchandise, among others. Apparently the band has =
embraced a couple of different sounds over the course of their several =
releases, but on this LP, at least, they remind me of a much rawer and =
more punk version of early PIL. Like PIL's first few records, Dads have =
this way of balancing almost willfully obtuse riffing with insistent, =
danceable grooves... PIL kind of summed it up perfectly in the title of =
their song "Death Disco." Really, it's not terribly unlike Merchandise, =
but replace that band's kind of wistful vibes with something darker and =
druggier and you have Dads.<br><br>

The Capitalist Kids: <i>Lessons on Love, Sharing, and Hygiene</i> 12" =
(Toxic Pop)<br>
Killer pop-punk from this Austin, TX band. Yeah, it's maybe a little bit =
on the syrupy side compared to the kind of stuff I usually carry, but you =
really can't deny hooks like these. This is like the perfect mix of =
Lookout!-era Green Day and the early Lillingtons stuff, though in places =
it also reminds me of Tenement's most straightforward material. In other =
words, it's definitely Ramones-influenced and has that big guitar sound, =
but the melodies are a little more complex and classically pop. If you're =
into this style of pop-punk at all you definitely need to check this band =
out.<br><br>

Paper Dragons: <i>Die to Please</i> 12" (Firestarter)<br>
Debut 12" from this Baltimore band featuring members of a heap of =
well-known groups like Pulling Teeth, Deep Sleep, the Spark, Dead =
Mechanical, and many others. Deep Sleep is probably the best comparison to =
Paper Dragons' sound; like DS, Paper Dragons exist on the catchier / more =
melodic end of the hardcore spectrum, but they dispense with the All-isms =
of Deep Sleep. The label description calls it "Circle Jerks meets the =
Wipers," and I can definitely see that, as there's a locked-in, driving =
quality that definitely recalls the Wipers. Perhaps the perfect modern =
reference would be demo-era Cloak/Dagger. At any rate, this is a killer =
album of hooky, driving hardcore punk.<br><br>

Quailbones / Happy Forever: Split cassette (Ghost Orchard)<br>
One side of this cassette comprises the latest material from Murray, =
Kentucky's Quailbones. If you caught a copy of their criminally limited =
(100 copies!) 7", you know that they play lush, exquisite, and =
densely-layered post-punk with a pop edge. Fans of Whatever Brains will =
definitely be interested, though Quailbones have a more straightforward =
vocal approach that doesn't take as much getting used to. These tracks, =
however, are super raw (live / rehearsal recordings?), yet the hooks and =
intricacies still shine through. As for Happy Forever, I don't know much =
about them, but they're really a perfect pairing for Quailbones, as they =
have a similarly eclectic approach with lots of lush instrumentation and =
pop melody, though some added Velvets influence. At any rate, this is a =
killer split chock full of music from two great bands.<br><br>

Psychic Blood: <i>Autumn Curses</i> cassette (self-released)<br>
Cassette-only album from this New England noise rock / post-punk / indie =
band. First of all, the band has has several previous cassette-only =
releases, but they're presenting this one as their debut full-length =
rather than just another demo. It's definitely a lengthy and =
fully-realized collection of songs, even if the recording itself is still =
a bit on the raw side. As for the sound, they definitely have more than a =
little bit in common with the almighty Shoppers. Like that band, when you =
first hear them you think it's just going to be straight-up <i>Daydream =
Nation</I>-era Sonic Youth worship, but the record quickly reveals itself =
to be much more than that. Hooks abound and come from unlikely places, and =
there's a driving punk energy that separates this from the gloomy, =
directionless plod that some similar bands can fall into. Fans of =
Shoppers, Panzram, Merchandise, Neon Blud, et al should definitely check =
this one out.<br><br>
