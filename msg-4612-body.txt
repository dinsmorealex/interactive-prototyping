Roses By Other Names
Curated by Jaishri Abichandani
Discover new prints, meet the artists and curator,
and enjoy the fall evening with us!
Reception: Wednesday, September 25, from 6-8pm.
On view through November 17, 2013

Roses By Other Names includes divergent works by artists exploring the relationship
of printmaking to photography, painting, and sculpture, and the slippage between
 text and image. The works in the exhibition quote photography by exaggerating pixels
to the verge of abstraction or destruction (Megan Berk, Jay Zehngebot, and Gary 
Michaels); displace associative meanings between text and images (Teresa Lundgren
and Rachael Abrams); or produce deeply intuitive works with embedded narratives 
and painterly overtones (Irena Pejovic and Ali Medina). Emily Noelle Lambert also
presents whimsical representational portraiture and cityscapes that at first glance
appear to be paintings; while Felix Plaza's intricate cut-outs of garments and Liz
Zanis' necklace take a sculptural approach to extending the printmaking process 
out of traditional realms. The exhibition title refers to the works presented by
 Teresa Lundgren and Megan Berk, the diversity of artists within the exhibition 
and printmaking as the unifying activity behind all the works.

 the slippage between text and image.&nbsp;The works in the exhibition quot=
e photography by exaggerating pixels to the verge of abstraction or destruc=
tion (<b>Megan Berk</b>, <b>Jay Zehngebot</b>, and <b>Gary Michaels</b>); d=
isplace associative meanings between text and images (<b>Teresa Lundgren</b=

resents whimsical representational portraiture and cityscapes that at first=
