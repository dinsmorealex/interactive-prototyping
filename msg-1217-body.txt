   possible.

    [1]General application requirements

   [3]International information

   Pratt's graduate departments offer generous merit scholarships, and
   Pratt has increased the funding available for next year. Graduate
   assistantships are available to second year students.  In addition,
   graduate students often work on campus.

   This is a great time to go to graduate school and do what you have
   always wanted to do.  Pratt Institute is ranked among the top
   design schools in the country by Newsweek, and virtually of of the
   ranked programs are ranked within the top ten.  Our [4]M.Arch first
   professional degree was recently ranked among the top ten in the
   world by Archifund.  The M.Arch is open to students with any kind

   of emphasis, the program is designed to encourage a wide variety of
   interdisciplinary and cross- disciplinary study.The program
   encourages students to develop their vision in ways they could not
   have anticipated before arriving at Pratt. The faculty, all of whom
   are practicing artists, are incredibly generous in their
   interactions with students, bringing with them an interest in
   conceptual ideas along with a respect for the achievement of craft.
   These are just a few of [8]Pratt's programs.  Pratt also offers
   historic preservation of buildings, city and regional planning, art
   therapy, over 25 programs from which to choose.
