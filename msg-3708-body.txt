OFFICE / DESK SPACE FOR RENT OR SUBLET

$500 per month, Ridgewood, 650 sf, Decatur Studios - Seeking artist who  pr=
imarily
works at a desk, ie., graphic designer, editor or writer to  share amazing =
studio
space with sculptor and photographer, concrete  floors, 20' ceilings, priva=
te marble
bathroom
Available: June 15th through Sept 30th
If you want a three to four month lease starting June 15th and want to  wor=
k in=20
an art studio environment but primarily do most of your work at a  desk the=
n keep
reading.
The space is a 650 sf studio in the fully rented Decatur Studio building  i=
n Ridgewood
located at the Halsey L stop which is two blocks away.   From the L it take=
s 20=20
minutes to get to Manhattan.
The studio has a slop sink, rugged concrete floors, 20' ceilings,  refined =
private
marble bathroom and a small catering station (coffee and  tea mostly).  You=
 would
be sharing the space with a sculptor and  photographer.  Storage is availab=
le.
I am a Cornell and Yale grad working in fine arts and architecture out  of =
my studio
space.  Sometimes this is my primary space and I will use  it everyday - ot=
her times
I am hardly there.  I have a desk where I work  and I also fabricate some n=
on-toxic
sculptures in the space.  Even  though, we like to keep the space well orga=
nized
 and clean!
I share this studio with a photographer who has a desk and a back drop.   S=
he usually
uses the space sporadically for four hours at a time to do  test shoots of =
models.
 I usually take off when I know she needs to do a  shoot.  This might only =
happen
once or twice a week and other than that  she is rarely there, off on other=
 shoots.
 Occasionally for a big  project it is more.  We have an online calendar to=
 coordinate
shoots,  studio visits, and other meetings that may require privacy.
What we are looking for in a studio mate:
We are looking for someone (preferably female, but not a requirement)  who =
works
 in the arts and wants to work in a studio environment but  primarily works=
 at a
 desk or at a computer.  It would be ideal if you  planned to use the space=
 part-time.
 With the sculpture and photography  there is enough action in the space as=
 is.=20
 But by enough, I mean, that  we like to keep the action to a pretty minima=
l level.
Only serious inquires please.
Amenities:
Utilities included (electric, gas, water, trash removal)
Free Wifi

$400 per month, Williamsburg, Space Available in Studio Share
Available: July 1 through ---
We are an artist and craftsman who just rented a huge space, slated to  be =
a collaborating
ground for some upcoming projects, that is way too  big for us. We are hopi=
ng to
 find a handful of creative professionals to  share it with us. We have a v=
ariety
of spaces, all flooded with natural  light, in a single-story former kosher=
 bakery
in South Williamsburg.
The Bakery is almost a century old, and we have spent the last few  months =
giving
it a deluxe facelift: New walls, new skylights, endless  gallons of paint, =
and insulation
for the 15 foot ceilings.
We hope it will become an open space full of collaborative individuals,  ea=
ting=20
lunch together, joining forces when appropriate, enjoying happy  hour on th=
e roof,
and being more productive for it. We've built in  meeting spaces, working s=
paces,
and a flexible gallery/storefront for  art shows or pop-up shops.
We'd like to curate our studio mates carefully, people using different  pro=
cesses
but with common goals and we're looking foreword to having  more voices to =
weigh
 in on the future of The Bakery. Right now it's just  a baby space, it will=
 be up
to all of us to raise it right!
We a re curious to hear from anyone who needs desk space, office space  or =
clean
 studio space, so call us up or send us an email, we are super  excited to =
find=20
out what you're working on!

$900 per month, Windsor Terrace/Park Slope, 2 bedrooms available for rent
Available: Aug 1st
Hello! Two bedrooms are opening in my three bedroom apartment. Move-in  is =
August
1 or September 1 with a one year lease agreement. I am  starting to show th=
e apartment
this week and would like to have things  settled before June 15th because I=
 am leaving
the country to study  abroad for the summer.
The apartment is located on 17th street and Prospect Park West. The  buildi=
ng is
 three blocks from the F and G lines at the 15th Street  Prospect Park stat=
ion.
There are some great features to the apartment: a medium-sized patio  where=
 we can
put a table, chairs, grill and store bikes; two living  rooms which will gi=
ve us
 all a little more personal space; one bathroom  in good condition; dishwas=
her;=20
ceiling fans; reliable and reputable  landlords who live on first floor (th=
is is
 third floor walk-up/the  apartment is on the second floor); best of all it=
 is a
 less than five  minute walk to prospect park!
One of the bedrooms has French doors and is off of the main living room.  T=
here=20
are unfortunately no windows in this room but there are glass  doors that o=
ffers
 nice light from the main room and the landlord just  installed a new ceili=
ng fan
fan. It's a good size room, comes with a  large wardrobe, and can easily fi=
t a full
or queen with room for dresser  and desk. (I can email you pictures of the =
bedroom,
I need to  photograph that room still. )
The second bedroom is where I have lived the last year. The bedroom has a  =
nice=20
window dressed glass door and is off of the main living room.  There is a w=
indow
 that provides for some nice natural light. There is a  small closet in the=
 room
 but a larger wardrobe in the living room. It's a  small size room, but fit=
s a full
bed, a dresser and a desk. (Pictures  are attached of this room)
The rent is $900/month with heat and hot water included. We will all  split=
 electricity
(about $25/mo), and Internet (about $15/mo) each  month. You will be asked =
to pay
up front first month's, and security,  totaling $1800/person. You will need=
 to go
through a credit check with  the realtor, so good credit required.
A little bit about me: I moved here from San Francisco to attend  graduate =
school
full time at Pratt for an MS in Communication Design. I  am in my early 30s=
 and=20
for fun I love exploring the city. I do stay  active and love running in th=
e park
near by. (if you are a runner there  is a great 4 mile loop around the park=
) I love
to cook when I can and  like living a healthy lifestyle.
I am busy with school and work out of the house at my school studio in  the=
 city.
I am pretty laid back, active, and hoping to keep a peaceful  environment i=
n the
 house. I am seeking roommates are respectful, clean  and responsible (ie: =
pay rent
and utilities on time; conserve  electricity/water when possible, help clea=
n once
a week etc.).
If this sounds like a good fit for you, please tell us a little about  your=
self.
 I am happy to show the apt this week if you would like to set  up a time. =
In the
meantime some pictures are attached.

$1225 per month, Sunset Park, Roomie needed for amazing house share!!!
Available: July 1st, 2013 through indefinite
Want to be in a house? With a driveway? And your own balcony? How about  wa=
sher/dryer,
dishwasher, backyard, and shared bathroom?! Then keep  reading!!!!
Hey Craigslist!
My roommate and I are looking for an awesome third roommate to share our  e=
ntire
 house in Sunset Park Brooklyn! See below for info and click on  the link f=
or photos,
hope to hear from you!
About the House
When we say house we mean it! This is a three-floor, plus basement, free  s=
tanding
home. We have central air and heat and here's the description  of all of it=
! There
will also be an extra spot in the driveway for a car  if you happen to have=
 one=20
and need to park it! :)
The basement is finished (see photo from when we moved in, please note  the=
 back
 room in the picture is now made up as a guest room) and has a  great guest=
 room
 with its own bathroom that we all use for friends and  family visiting tow=
n or,
 if you want to use parts of the basement for an  office or studio sometime=
s we=20
can discuss that as well. The basement  also has a great large space for a =
yoga=20
or for art or any other things  you can think of!
Ok, first floor: The first floor has a living room with a couch, small  tab=
le and
chairs, and another larger table by the front window. It;s a  great big pla=
ce to
 have dinner parties or what have you. The kitchen has  all new appliances,=
 washer/dryer
and dish washer(!!!) and chef's stove.  That all opens out to our BACK YARD=
 with
 small porch and garden that  could definitely use more TLC if you are into=
 gardening!
We have a BBQ  grill and host some grilling during the summer.
YOUR ROOM, is on the second floor and is the smaller of the two rooms on  t=
hat floor.
It is the photo of the empty room, from when we first moved  in. Currently =
our roommate
in there has a queen bed, desk, bookshelf  and small bench in there so it i=
s still
a great size. It has a large  closet and small balcony(!!!) Check out the p=
icture
of the front of the  house, you can see the balcony there. The second floor=
 has=20
a bathroom  that we share.
About Your Roommates!
Your potential future roommates are Mike and Lauren, two social justice  mi=
nded=20
lawyers who also enjoy board games, cooking, exploring NYC and  goofing wit=
h Lauren's
two cats muffin and pumpkin (yes we have two  cats!) We have our own spaces=
 but=20
enjoy sharing a drink together at  night or chatting over dinner. We like h=
aving
 kind of a community type  house where we help each other out if we're runn=
ing to
the store but  keep separate shelves and cabinets for food. We have and do =
chores
but  also hire a really cool cooperative cleaning company to do the common =
 areas
once a month.
About the Neighborhood
We LOVE our location as well, we are located right between sunset park  and=
 south
park slope in an area known as "Greenwood Heights." We are  three blocks fr=
om the
N/D express trains (two stops into manhattan!) and  the R local train at 36=
th street.
Sunset park is a fantastically  diverse area featuring the best view of the=
 NYC=20
skyline in the park just  8 blocks away. It also has AMAZING mexican food, =
great
 coffee shops, a  retro bowling alley, and is a hop skip and a jump from Br=
ooklyn's
 chinatown with the best hot pot outside of ChongQing.
To the north is south park slope and a bus across from the apartment  (the =
b63)=20
will take you directly into all the wonders that park slope  has to offer. =
Truly
 we love it here and we hope you do too!
About You
You are a no drama easy to get along with individual who wants to be a  par=
t of=20
a house that's not over the top cooperative but is a small group  of people=
 who=20
want to make a home. No smokers or hard drugs and sadly  our cats would fre=
ak out
if another was added so sadly, we can't take  anymore cats or other pets (u=
nless
 maybe you have an iguana :)) and, due  to sensitive allergies, we can't ha=
ve someone
that uses air fresheners  in the room. We'd prefer a professional who works=
 away
 from home unless  you are interested in renting out the basement for part =
of your
office  or studio. looking so forward to meeting YOU, future roomie!!
Rent
As of now the room is $1225 per month. There is a chance that Mike's  aweso=
me girlfriend
may move in with mike in his room and the rent would  be cheaper but we're =
not quite
sure!
If interested
Please send us an email with a little about yourself, what you're looking f=
or, and
your favorite board game &#x263a;

$1100 per month, Clinton Hill, Looking for a roommate to share my lovely  2=
 bedroom
in Clinton Hill -- with our own large private terrace
Available: Immediately through May 2014, or earlier
I'm looking for a roommate to fill the second bedroom of my new 2  bedroom =
apartment.
I just moved in, and I'm looking for someone to move  in immediately or Jun=
e 15th
(or possibly July 1st).
The apartment is on the 2nd floor and we have our own private patio off  th=
e living
room! Your room is 11x7, but the closet is in the hallway.  There is a hook=
up for
a washer and dryer, but no machines. So we can  either chip in together for=
 the=20
washer/dryer or use the space for  storage. The kitchen is huge and has eno=
ugh room
for a full table. It  has a separate living room that is definitely big eno=
ugh for
a  couch/living area, bookshelves, and a desk if you wanted.
The place is in Clinton Hill (right off the Pratt campus), which is  beauti=
ful.=20
The closest train is the G Classon stop, which is about a 5  minute walk. T=
here=20
are a lot of buses too if you want to get to downtown  Brooklyn, bushwick, =
prospect
heights, or Williamsburg. There is a nice  health food store a block away, =
as well
as coffee shops and restaurants  (and my favorite - Bergen Bagels).
I am a 25 year old girl working in art/design. And I am looking for  anyone=
 interested
in making it a nice comfortable place to live. I'm not  a neat freak but ce=
rtainly
like to keep things tidy. I do have two  wonderful cats who are very loving=
 and=20
social. I would not be totally  opposed to other cats or dogs, as long as w=
e can
 check before hand that  they all get along.
Please let me know if you have questions or would be interested in  seeing =
the place!
Let me know a little bit about yourself and when  you'll need to move in. I=
 look
 forward to hearing from you!

$400 per week, Greenpoint, 10x10, Cozy Furnished Room in Safe and Trendy Gr=

Available: June 10
- 1 Room for rent starting June 10 for a single individual in Greenpoint, B=
rooklyn
- $375/week utilities and Wireles Internet included
- Non-smokers please
- No pets please
THE ROOM FOR RENT IS FEATURED IN THE PICTURES WITHOUT FURNITURE BUT IT  IS =
BEING
 DELIVERED ON THE 5TH IN ANTICIPATION OF RECEIVING BOARDERS  STARTING MONDA=
Y JUNE
10TH.
Greenpoint is one of the safest, quietest, quaintest, prettiest and most  c=
onvenient
neighborhoods the city has to offer.  Five blocks away you  have the East R=
iver=20
Ferry, which for four dollars will shuttle you  directly to Midtown (as wel=
l as=20
Williamsburg, Dumbo and Governor's  Island). The G train is less than a 5-m=
inute
 walk from the location and  connections can be made to the L, E, M and 7 t=
rains.
 All trains are  within walking distance.  McCarren Park is close by with a=
 large
green  space, playgrounds, track and a Farmer's Market on Saturdays.  If yo=
u  have
a car, parking is relatively easy to find in the neighborhood.   Regular al=
ternative
side of the street parking rules apply.
I am seeking individuals who are neat and who understand the importance  of=
 cleaning
up immediately after making a mess (mainly in the kitchen  area) and who al=
so have
no problem sharing the cleaning responsibilities  in the entire household i=
f staying
for an extended period of time.  I  am searching for people who have active=
 work/school
lives and can keep  noise to a minimum during nighttime hours.  Weekends, o=
f course,
are a  different story.
About the apartment:
Two bedrooms and a small bathroom with shelving space available.  The  kitc=
hen has
all the necessary appointments and a small kitchen table  that seats 4.  Th=
ere is
a patio area that I am planning to turn into a  brunch nook but that is sti=
ll in
 the works so if you have any  suggestions as to how this area can be decor=
ated=20
I am open to hear them!  The living room has a sofa bed for guests, a TV wi=
th a=20
DVD player but  no cable (I do not plan on getting cable ever).
A little about your potential roommate:
I am a legal professional and I work primarily from home.  I  occasionally =
have=20
guests over but I would rather have my social time  outside of the house.  =
I enjoy
being social with the person I am living  with although it is not necessary=
 that
 we are all in each others'  business.  I think it is important to be cordi=
al and
friendly with the  people I live with because I thoroughly appreciate a str=
ess free
living  environment.  I am a firm believer in communication so, if there is=
 an =20
issue that involves me or the household, a respectful an non combative  dis=
cussion
needs to happen.  I like to make costumes as a hobby and you  will see me f=
uriously
sewing away on occasion.  Dancing is my favorite  pastime and I frequently =
go and
shake my booty with my people.  I like  to hoop on occasion and I have two =
hoops
 that I tote around with me.
If you are interested in booking a week or longer or you want to learn more=

 only
 one other roommate.

$1375 per month, Park Slope, Brooklyn, 2 BR, 700 sf, Short term furnished s=
ublet/shared
apartment
Available: June 18, 2013 through July 18, 2013
I'm subletting my bedroom while I'm away from June 18-  July 18. Rent is  $=
1375=20
 plus utilities and internet, usually about $55/month.
Your roommate will be Fiona, a very lovely graphic designer from Melbourne.
The apartment is clean, cozy, charming, fully furnished with great  renovat=
ed bathroom
and kitchen (dishwasher, microwave, gas stove). The  room has a queen sized=
 bed,
 a closet with plenty of coat hangers, a  bureau of shelves and a small des=
k. The
room measures about 12x15 feet. I  have an iron and ironing board you can u=
se. The
bedrooms are on the  opposite ends of the apartment, so privacy is not an i=
ssue.
 We have very  nice neighbors and a friendly, helpful landlord.
The apartment is in Center (Park) Slope - a very easy neighborhood to  live=
 in.=20
Every convenience is within a few blocks of the apartment  (gourmet and che=
ap groceries,
drugstore, post office, gyms, restaurants,  shopping). Prospect Park is 2 b=
locks
 away. We have several great cafes  within 1-4 blocks, including Almondine =
french
bakery just downstairs  from us. Barbes, down the block, is one of Brooklyn=
's best
bars for  music. The F and G trains are 20 steps from the door, and will ta=
ke you
 directly to or near most of the fun neighborhoods in Brooklyn (5-20  minut=
es) and
Manhattan (20-40 minutes). The R train is 2 1/2 blocks  away. You can also =
easily
walk through many of Brooklyn's loveliest  neighborhoods within 30 minutes =
of the
apartment. BAM, Brooklyn Museum,  Brooklyn Botanic Garden, and the Saturday=
 farmers
market are all within  within a 20-30 minute walk. There are laundry servic=
es within
1 block  and a laundromat 2 blocks away. There are UPS and Fedex locations =
within
 1 block. If you have a car, parking in the neighborhood is manageable,  de=
pending
on your schedule, and generally safe.
It's a non-smoking building - I don't smoke and hopefully you don't (much).
There is no A/C in the apartment and it tends to be hot in the summer.  It =
could
 be possible to add A/C at an extra cost, but I usually just try  to keep o=
ut the
heat with clever window and shade management.
There is a dog that lives here normally but he will probably be gone while =
you are
here.

to a great YMCA. There are tons of great  restaurants and bars around the c=

The apartment itself is on the top flor of a limestone walkup. It's a  pret=

block, and the bedroom is in the back and quiet! There's  an eat-in kitchen=

a living room, and my bedroom is in the front of  the apartment (there's al=
so another,
small bedroom in the back which I  am currently using as a workspace).

 productions
now, but have done a lot of work with contemporary  artists. I travel a lot=
 for=20
work, often several times a month for days  at a time.
I'm very friendly and laid back, but I'm also pretty into keeping the  plac=
e clean
and tidy, and I would love if you felt the same! I have no  sex/gender pref=
s, and
in my time in this building, I've had both male  and female roommates.
I prefer that you have a job/occupation outside of the apartment at  least =
some=20
of the time. Please be a nonsmoker! And while you can be part  of a couple =
(of course),
I don't want to live with a couple.
Depending on the situation, there may be potential for a long term stay.

LIVE/WORK

$3300 per month, South Williamsburg, 1000 sq. ft., Live/Work Sublet - Perfe=
ct Location/Great
Space
Available: July 1 through September 10 (dates may be flexible)
Fully furnished artist's live-work space
completely private- not a share
A great place to make work
unfortunately no heavy duty materials (stone, cement, welding, other indust=
rial=20
or heavy materials)
***There is a small black Cat- who must be cared for as part of the deal, a=
s well
as plants that need to be kept alive
The space is in a small loft building with only 7 units filled with  artist=
s- one
of the last buildings of its kind in South Williamsburg.
It is on Bedford ave. very near the Williamsburg bridge-
The walkway to the bridge is 1 block away and walking to Manhattan takes ab=
out 15
min.
There is a bike shop next door and we are 2 blocks away from each of 2 new =
citibike
rideshare docks
The neighborhood is very safe and has some of the city's best  restaurants =
and bars
within a 5 block radius, many of them with  excellent outdoor dining/drinki=
ng roofs
and patios.
South Williamsburg is the latest chic neighborhood in NYC and has a very hi=
gh quality
of life...
Close to the north-side with McCarron park and pool- it is not as crowded o=
r young.
You may never bother going into Manhattan with all the things available to =
you outside
your door.
However the Lower East Side and the East Village are 1 subway stop away...
The apt. has a wonderfully NY roof deck with original graffiti from  1980's=
 graffiti
originals...  it looks at the horizontal walkway of the  Williamsburg bridg=
e.
Perfect for BBQing (there is a webber BBQ) drinking a beer or reading.
***There may be construction happening on the deck by the neighbors this su=
mmer-
 at this time I have no further details on this.
Normally the apartment is very quiet despite its proximity to the bridge...
There is great street parking all around the neighborhood- if you have a ca=
r.
The loft is not grandiose or high-end, but very functional spacious and com=
fortable.
It is light and airy- with small skylights scattering diffuse light through=
out the
house.
The bedroom is large with a comfortable bed, a couch, coffee table, closet,=
 shelving
and its own window.
The living area has a large TV, a couch, marble coffee table, large dining =
table
 and plenty of books to enjoy.
The kitchen is fully functional and large by NY standards.
The bathroom is clean and has a tub.
There are 2 air-conditioners in the apartment- 1 in the studio and 1 in the=
 bedroom.
There are also 3 fans.
wifi & AppleTV included
The studio is a truly wonderful place to work. Quiet and well lit- with gre=
at working
walls and viewing distances.
Please email with a short introduction about yourself.
We will require July/August rent + 1 month deposit up-front as well as 2 re=
ferences

New Paltz/Woodstock area, $1000 per month, Catskill Mountains, upstate  New=
 York,
1200 SF 3 BR surrounded by forest and stream, Amazing  opportunity to share=
 house
in the country with mostly absent artist  owner
Available: June 1, 2013 through open
Nestled in the Catskill Mountains just 2 hrs north of the GWB, an oasis  of=
 quiet,
fresh air and wild life. Ideal for artists, writers and other  creative peo=
ple who
want to focus on their projects without the usual  distractions. 1200 sf 3 =
BR house
with detached workshop gives ample  space for your craft and your mind. Lar=
ge living
room with open kitchen,  tastefully decorated with art and Tibetan rugs, pl=
us art/work
space,  your bedroom and full bathroom downstairs. My bedroom and guest bed=
room=20
 upstairs. This cozy 2 story house with cathedral ceilings, 1.5 bath, and  =
a great
wood stove that keeps the house comfortable during the cold  months, looks =
out on
a meandering stream that crosses the property.
This rental is intended for a single person, but I am open to discussing th=
e possibility
of sharing with a couple.
We can discuss what would be the best arrangement for both of us. One  opti=
on could
be where you basically have the house all to yourself,  except for two week=
ends=20
a month when I will use the house exclusively.  That obviously would not wo=
rk if
 you are planning to move into the house  full-time. Unless you can be flex=
ible=20
about these two weekends. Another  option could be where on average 6 days =
a week
you have the place all  to your self. I would come up from NYC about once a=
 week
 to stay for a  day ( 2 nights usually). Holidays can be discussed.
If you can be okay with any of the above arrangements, this might be a  gre=
at deal
for you. I prefer more prolonged commitments (6+ months ) but  will conside=
r shorter
rentals. Non-smokers only. You can check the  house out - and see more pict=
ures=20
- by visiting the somewhat dated house  website www.catskillrentalhouse.com
I am planning to install a washer/dryer in the next 6 months. And a  bathho=
use with
sauna-room next to the stream in the next 12 months or  so.
If you're wondering what kind of art I'm involved with you can see and  hea=
r some
of that on my website: www.marcelvanrootselaar.com
Rent $1000/month plus utilities. $2500 security deposit plus references.
Local Transportation: Buses to New Paltz or Kingston, local cab. Or drive u=
p yourself.
It's about a 2 hr drive from the GWB.
Looking forward to hear from you.

My wonderful live/work apartment is available for sublet for the month of J=

Excellent studio space AND a lovely place to live. I will have the  studio =
cleared
out so it can be used- as long as materials are not  hazardous as this is a=

. There
is a private landing and  staircase to the apartment that is good for stori=
ng bikes,
shoes etc.  Great, spacious well-appointed kitchen with lots of counter spa=
ce and
a  nice small dining area with a table that seats 4 (not pictured).
Located on 32nd st on the Greenwood Heights/Sunset Park border, lots of  ar=
tists
 and artist studios in close proximity, awesome tacos in Sunset  Park, walk=
ing distance
to S Slope bars and restaurants, and very close  to great trains (the D, N,=
 R at
 36th st): 2 stops on the express train  to the lower east side. Top floor =
with=20
lots of windows, a skylight and  wonderful of natural light.
This is a 3-apartment building with great artists as the best neighbors  ev=
er! Patrick

in the
garage of our building, and they are very  welcoming ambassadors:
http://www.sadiehalieprojects.com.
Must be into living with and taking care of a very low-maintenance,  adorab=
le cat.
If you like cats this is a good situation for you- she is  very easy to tak=
e care
of and very loving. Also must be a non-smoker.  There is a non-smoking poli=
cy in
 the building including fire escape,  stoop etc.
Rent for the whole space including fast Wifi and all utilities plus use  of=
 a very
powerful AC is 1400. We've knocked the total expense down  because of the c=
at-sitting,
and because we are really hoping to  accommodate artists or friends of frie=
nds who
need a place to land.  Anyone interested is welcome to email me brickersusa=

ment
Available: July 4 through July 24
We're a couple looking for a responsible person or couple to sublet our  lo=
vely=20
apartment during our trip to Russia this July. We're gone for  three weeks =
but could
negotiate the entire month if it works better for  the right person.
We live in a spacious railroad style apartment, which has a bedroom with  a=
 queen
sized bed sandwiched in between two living room/study areas, a  spacious an=
d sunny
kitchen and one bathroom. Front and back rooms get  great light and catch t=
he breeze.
The living room that faces the street  can also be converted nicely into an=
other
 bedroom with our extra  mattress, room dividers and curtains. Our apartmen=
t boasts
an abundance  of books, records, and quirky, beautiful furniture. We also h=
ave an
air  conditioner, internet, and plenty of storage space for your belongings=
,  so
 you don't have to live out of a suitcase.
We're hoping to find someone who would be fine with feeding our two  cats. =
The cats
are gentle and affectionate, never angsty, and have the  nice habit of foll=
owing
 us from room to room to find a quiet resting  spot near us while we work. =
Their
 upkeep is minimal. However, if you're  interested in the space but not so =
much=20
the cats, please let us know as  we can make other arrangements for them (a=
nd would
clean the space  readily of all cat hair traces should you be allergic).
Our place is just a block from shady and lush McGolrick Park, which has  th=
e best
misty fountain to run through on a hot day. There's also a  farmers market =
on Sundays
and a grocery store on the corner. This  neighborhood is tranquil, with sev=
eral=20
nice restaurants and cafes (we'll  leave a map of our favorite spots) in th=
e immediate
vicinity as well as  a laundromat on the block. A 15 minute walk brings you=
 to the
hubbub of  Manhattan Ave, with all the bars, thrift stores, and restaurants=
 near
  McCarren Park, or in the other direction, to Graham Avenue with  it's...w=
ell,=20
bars, thrift stores and restaurants.

Seeking
simple and clean studio apt or room.
Available: Mid-Late August or early September
Hi there readers/renters/good people,
I am planning to leave behind my mediocre life in Washington, DC, after  4.=
5 years
and take some time off to travel the northwest. I'd like to  move to Brookl=
yn when
I return in mid/late August. I have family who  live on LI but prefer not t=
o get
 stuck there.
I am a 30yr old female museum professional with many years experience in  t=
he fundraising
field. I have lived in a handful of other cities (new  orleans, denver, and=
 athens,
greece) so am city savvy and flexible. I  try to live a minimalist life wit=
h not
 too much stuff, so I don't need a  big space to live in. I enjoy running, =
reading,
spending time with  drama-less people, and the occasional volunteering gig.=
 I am
 clean,  friendly, organized, and healthy-minded.
Please contact me if you have an apartment or room to rent or sub-let,  or =
if you
have a house/apt-sitting opportunity. My schedule is really  flexible. I pr=
efer=20
a space in or close to Park Slope, something in the  $1,200 range, if possi=
ble.
Thanks in advance,
Maria

ss small,
family run farms, farm to table  restaurants and opportunities, alongside t=
he fastest
growing wine region  in all of Canada make this island a very desirable and=
 special
tourist  destination. The entire south shore of the island is home to one o=

  best beaches in all of Canada - Sandbanks Provincial Park. Home to the  l=
argest
fresh water bay mouth dune barrier region in the world, expect  to be amaze=

towering white sand dunes, crystal clear water (Lake  Ontario) and incredib=

ble: July 1, 2013 through July 1, 2014<br /><br /> Hello, I am artist who m=
anages the art studios at QAS. A terrific private art studio is available J=
uly 1st. <br /> <br /> One 25' wall is a huge window facing east, so tons o=
f sunlight in the  morning and indirect light in the afternoons. Also plent=
y of wall space  for large size paintings or display.<br /> <br /> The stud=
io is on a floor with 10 other artists in cooperative, friendly  work envir=
onment. Access is 24/7 but absolutely no living. The freight  operates 7:30=
 - 3:30. The $775 includes heat, electric, trash and wifi.  As heat is on t=
he ceiling, the walls are 8' high therefore processes  that involve fumes o=
r dust are not compatible. Best use would be for  painter, graphic artist, =
illustrator, collagist. Studio is ~ 1 mile from  PS 1, Socrates Sculpture P=
ark, Fischer Landau Art Center plus lots of  neat places to eat in LIC. Eac=
h year we participate in LIC Art Festival  Open Studios.<br /> <br /> 1 yea=
r minimum commitment.<br /> <br /> Building is 1/2 block from F Train and a=
 8 minute walk for N and 7 trains at Queensboro Plaza.<br /> <br /> Please =

ilable: 6/15/13 through March 2014 or longer<br /><br /> I am a visual arti=
st (oil painter and photographer) and I looked long and hard to find this w=
onderful space, which I love:<br /> <br /> -Clean, light-filled studio with=
 high ceilings<br /> -Safe, well-run artist-friendly building (participates=
 in LIC Open Studios)<br /> -24/7 access, with freight elevator Mon-Fri,9-5=
<br /> -Shared sink and bathrooms down the hall<br /> -Heat, electricity an=
d Wifi included<br /> -No living, smoking, drugs or super-toxic materials (=
Turpenoid is OK)<br /> -Month-to-month agreement, with either party able to=
 terminate the agreement on 2 months' notice.<br /> -Rent $750-$950 dependi=
ng on time-share and space needs (to be negotiated at onset)<br /> -Two ref=
erences, plus one month security deposit and initial month's rent <br /> <b=
r /> IDEAL CANDIDATE:<br /> -One person in the arts (painter, writer, illus=
trator, designer, etc) with professional attitude<br /> -Reliable, consider=
ate, honest and direct, flexible, easy-going, with positive energy and atti=
tude<br /> -Someone who normally keeps the studio looking relatively clean =
and organized<br /> -Person who acts professionally, meets commitments, and=
 pays the rent on time <br /> -Someone who does not spend the entire day ta=
lking on the phone and does not have a constant stream of visitors <br /> -=
Ideally someone who mainly uses the studio mornings and weekends - but I am=
 flexible about this!<br /> <br /> I would like to keep an open feeling in =
the space, but am willing to  build a modest partition to define the space =
allotments. I'd like to  find a studio mate compatible sensibilities, in th=
e hope that we can  become friends.<br /><br /> <a style=3D"color: black;" =

sporadically for four hours at a time to do  test shoots of models.  I usua=

once or twice a week and other than that  she is rarely there, off on other=

 July 1 through ---<br /><br /> We are an artist and craftsman who just ren=
ted a huge space, slated to  be a collaborating ground for some upcoming pr=
ojects, that is way too  big for us. We are hoping to find a handful of cre=
ative professionals to  share it with us. We have a variety of spaces, all =
flooded with natural  light, in a single-story former kosher bakery in Sout=
h Williamsburg. <br /> <br /> The Bakery is almost a century old, and we ha=
ve spent the last few  months giving it a deluxe facelift: New walls, new s=
kylights, endless  gallons of paint, and insulation for the 15 foot ceiling=
s.<br /> <br /> We hope it will become an open space full of collaborative =
individuals,  eating lunch together, joining forces when appropriate, enjoy=
ing happy  hour on the roof, and being more productive for it. We've built =
in  meeting spaces, working spaces, and a flexible gallery/storefront for  =
art shows or pop-up shops. <br /> <br /> We'd like to curate our studio mat=
es carefully, people using different  processes but with common goals and w=
e're looking foreword to having  more voices to weigh in on the future of T=
he Bakery. Right now it's just  a baby space, it will be up to all of us to=
 raise it right!<br /> <br /> We a re curious to hear from anyone who needs=
 desk space, office space  or clean studio space, so call us up or send us =
an email, we are super  excited to find out what you're working on!<br /><b=

0 per month, Windsor Terrace/Park Slope, 2 bedrooms available for rent<br /=
> Available: Aug 1st<br /><br /> Hello! Two bedrooms are opening in my thre=
e bedroom apartment. Move-in  is August 1 or September 1 with a one year le=
ase agreement. I am  starting to show the apartment this week and would lik=
e to have things  settled before June 15th because I am leaving the country=
 to study  abroad for the summer. <br /> <br /> The apartment is located on=
 17th street and Prospect Park West. The  building is three blocks from the=
 F and G lines at the 15th Street  Prospect Park station.<br /> <br /> Ther=
e are some great features to the apartment: a medium-sized patio  where we =
can put a table, chairs, grill and store bikes; two living  rooms which wil=
l give us all a little more personal space; one bathroom  in good condition=
; dishwasher; ceiling fans; reliable and reputable  landlords who live on f=
irst floor (this is third floor walk-up/the  apartment is on the second flo=
or); best of all it is a less than five  minute walk to prospect park!<br /=
> <br /> One of the bedrooms has French doors and is off of the main living=
 room.  There are unfortunately no windows in this room but there are glass=
  doors that offers nice light from the main room and the landlord just  in=
stalled a new ceiling fan fan. It's a good size room, comes with a  large w=
ardrobe, and can easily fit a full or queen with room for dresser  and desk=
. (I can email you pictures of the bedroom, I need to  photograph that room=
 still. )<br /> <br /> The second bedroom is where I have lived the last ye=
ar. The bedroom has a  nice window dressed glass door and is off of the mai=
n living room.  There is a window that provides for some nice natural light=
. There is a  small closet in the room but a larger wardrobe in the living =
room. It's a  small size room, but fits a full bed, a dresser and a desk. (=
Pictures  are attached of this room)<br /> <br /> The rent is $900/month wi=
th heat and hot water included. We will all  split electricity (about $25/m=
o), and Internet (about $15/mo) each  month. You will be asked to pay up fr=
ont first month's, and security,  totaling $1800/person. You will need to g=
o through a credit check with  the realtor, so good credit required.<br /> =
<br /> A little bit about me: I moved here from San Francisco to attend  gr=
aduate school full time at Pratt for an MS in Communication Design. I  am i=
n my early 30s and for fun I love exploring the city. I do stay  active and=
 love running in the park near by. (if you are a runner there  is a great 4=
 mile loop around the park) I love to cook when I can and  like living a he=
althy lifestyle. <br /> <br /> I am busy with school and work out of the ho=
use at my school studio in  the city. I am pretty laid back, active, and ho=
ping to keep a peaceful  environment in the house. I am seeking roommates a=
re respectful, clean  and responsible (ie: pay rent and utilities on time; =
conserve  electricity/water when possible, help clean once a week etc.). <b=
r /> <br /> If this sounds like a good fit for you, please tell us a little=
 about  yourself. I am happy to show the apt this week if you would like to=
 set  up a time. In the meantime some pictures are attached.<br /><br /> <a=

se? With a driveway? And your own balcony? How about  washer/dryer, dishwas=
her, backyard, and shared bathroom?! Then keep  reading!!!!<br /> <br /> He=
y Craigslist!<br /> <br /> My roommate and I are looking for an awesome thi=
rd roommate to share our  entire house in Sunset Park Brooklyn! See below f=
or info and click on  the link for photos, hope to hear from you!<br /> <br=
 /> About the House<br /> When we say house we mean it! This is a three-flo=
or, plus basement, free  standing home. We have central air and heat and he=
re's the description  of all of it! There will also be an extra spot in the=
 driveway for a car  if you happen to have one and need to park it! :) <br =
/> <br /> The basement is finished (see photo from when we moved in, please=
 note  the back room in the picture is now made up as a guest room) and has=
 a  great guest room with its own bathroom that we all use for friends and =
 family visiting town or, if you want to use parts of the basement for an  =
office or studio sometimes we can discuss that as well. The basement  also =
has a great large space for a yoga or for art or any other things  you can =
think of!<br /> <br /> Ok, first floor: The first floor has a living room w=
ith a couch, small  table and chairs, and another larger table by the front=
 window. It;s a  great big place to have dinner parties or what have you. T=
he kitchen has  all new appliances, washer/dryer and dish washer(!!!) and c=
hef's stove.  That all opens out to our BACK YARD with small porch and gard=
en that  could definitely use more TLC if you are into gardening! We have a=
 BBQ  grill and host some grilling during the summer. <br /> <br /> YOUR RO=
OM, is on the second floor and is the smaller of the two rooms on  that flo=
or. It is the photo of the empty room, from when we first moved  in. Curren=
tly our roommate in there has a queen bed, desk, bookshelf  and small bench=
 in there so it is still a great size. It has a large  closet and small bal=
cony(!!!) Check out the picture of the front of the  house, you can see the=
 balcony there. The second floor has a bathroom  that we share. <br /> <br =
/> About Your Roommates!<br /> Your potential future roommates are Mike and=
 Lauren, two social justice  minded lawyers who also enjoy board games, coo=
king, exploring NYC and  goofing with Lauren's two cats muffin and pumpkin =
(yes we have two  cats!) We have our own spaces but enjoy sharing a drink t=
ogether at  night or chatting over dinner. We like having kind of a communi=
ty type  house where we help each other out if we're running to the store b=
ut  keep separate shelves and cabinets for food. We have and do chores but =
 also hire a really cool cooperative cleaning company to do the common  are=
as once a month. <br /> <br /> About the Neighborhood<br /> We LOVE our loc=
ation as well, we are located right between sunset park  and south park slo=
pe in an area known as "Greenwood Heights." We are  three blocks from the N=
/D express trains (two stops into manhattan!) and  the R local train at 36t=
h street. Sunset park is a fantastically  diverse area featuring the best v=
iew of the NYC skyline in the park just  8 blocks away. It also has AMAZING=
 mexican food, great coffee shops, a  retro bowling alley, and is a hop ski=
p and a jump from Brooklyn's  chinatown with the best hot pot outside of Ch=
ongQing.<br /> To the north is south park slope and a bus across from the a=
partment  (the b63) will take you directly into all the wonders that park s=
lope  has to offer. Truly we love it here and we hope you do too!<br /> <br=
 /> About You<br /> You are a no drama easy to get along with individual wh=
o wants to be a  part of a house that's not over the top cooperative but is=
 a small group  of people who want to make a home. No smokers or hard drugs=
 and sadly  our cats would freak out if another was added so sadly, we can'=
t take  anymore cats or other pets (unless maybe you have an iguana :)) and=
, due  to sensitive allergies, we can't have someone that uses air freshene=

nd Hawaii, he does commercial photography and  is working towards a career =
in travel photography. He shoots awesome  candid shots and makes hilarious =
videos. I am an artist, educator, and  traveler. I cook, grow abundant plan=
ts, and like soft lighting from the  floor. Our 3rd roommate is a Dutch wom=
an who is here for a 3 month  puppetry/ theater internship in Bushwick. She=
 is having a wonderful time  exploring the city and she makes fine art that=
 has an illustrator's  aesthetic. We are all very professional, peaceful, a=
nd positive people  and we are looking for the same. Good luck in your apar=

00 per month, Clinton Hill, Looking for a roommate to share my lovely  2 be=
droom in Clinton Hill -- with our own large private terrace<br /> Available=
: Immediately through May 2014, or earlier<br /><br /> I'm looking for a ro=
ommate to fill the second bedroom of my new 2  bedroom apartment. I just mo=
ved in, and I'm looking for someone to move  in immediately or June 15th (o=
r possibly July 1st). <br /> <br /> The apartment is on the 2nd floor and w=
e have our own private patio off  the living room! Your room is 11x7, but t=
he closet is in the hallway.  There is a hookup for a washer and dryer, but=
 no machines. So we can  either chip in together for the washer/dryer or us=
e the space for  storage. The kitchen is huge and has enough room for a ful=
l table. It  has a separate living room that is definitely big enough for a=
  couch/living area, bookshelves, and a desk if you wanted. <br /> <br /> T=
he place is in Clinton Hill (right off the Pratt campus), which is  beautif=
ul. The closest train is the G Classon stop, which is about a 5  minute wal=
k. There are a lot of buses too if you want to get to downtown  Brooklyn, b=
ushwick, prospect heights, or Williamsburg. There is a nice  health food st=
ore a block away, as well as coffee shops and restaurants  (and my favorite=
 - Bergen Bagels).<br /> <br /> I am a 25 year old girl working in art/desi=
gn. And I am looking for  anyone interested in making it a nice comfortable=
 place to live. I'm not  a neat freak but certainly like to keep things tid=
y. I do have two  wonderful cats who are very loving and social. I would no=
t be totally  opposed to other cats or dogs, as long as we can check before=
 hand that  they all get along. <br /> <br /> Please let me know if you hav=
e questions or would be interested in  seeing the place! Let me know a litt=

that we are all in each others'  business.  I think it is important to be c=
ordial and friendly with the  people I live with because I thoroughly appre=
ciate a stress free living  environment.  I am a firm believer in communica=
tion so, if there is an  issue that involves me or the household, a respect=
ful an non combative  discussion needs to happen.  I like to make costumes =
as a hobby and you  will see me furiously sewing away on occasion.  Dancing=
 is my favorite  pastime and I frequently go and shake my booty with my peo=
ple.  I like  to hoop on occasion and I have two hoops that I tote around w=
ith me.  <br /> <br /> If you are interested in booking a week or longer or=

  It could be possible to add A/C at an extra cost, but I usually just try =

 June 1, 2013 through open<br /><br /> Nestled in the Catskill Mountains ju=
st 2 hrs north of the GWB, an oasis  of quiet, fresh air and wild life. Ide=
al for artists, writers and other  creative people who want to focus on the=
ir projects without the usual  distractions. 1200 sf 3 BR house with detach=
ed workshop gives ample  space for your craft and your mind. Large living r=
oom with open kitchen,  tastefully decorated with art and Tibetan rugs, plu=
s art/work space,  your bedroom and full bathroom downstairs. My bedroom an=
d guest bedroom  upstairs. This cozy 2 story house with cathedral ceilings,=
 1.5 bath, and  a great wood stove that keeps the house comfortable during =
the cold  months, looks out on a meandering stream that crosses the propert=
y.<br /> This rental is intended for a single person, but I am open to disc=
ussing the possibility of sharing with a couple.<br /> We can discuss what =
would be the best arrangement for both of us. One  option could be where yo=
u basically have the house all to yourself,  except for two weekends a mont=
h when I will use the house exclusively.  That obviously would not work if =
you are planning to move into the house  full-time. Unless you can be flexi=
ble about these two weekends. Another  option could be where on average 6 d=
ays a week you have the place all  to your self. I would come up from NYC a=
bout once a week to stay for a  day ( 2 nights usually). Holidays can be di=
scussed.<br /> If you can be okay with any of the above arrangements, this =
might be a  great deal for you. I prefer more prolonged commitments (6+ mon=
ths ) but  will consider shorter rentals. Non-smokers only. You can check t=
he  house out - and see more pictures - by visiting the somewhat dated hous=
e  website www.catskillrentalhouse.com<br /> I am planning to install a was=
her/dryer in the next 6 months. And a  bathhouse with sauna-room next to th=
e stream in the next 12 months or  so.<br /> If you're wondering what kind =
of art I'm involved with you can see and  hear some of that on my website: =
www.marcelvanrootselaar.com<br /> <br /> Rent $1000/month plus utilities. $=
2500 security deposit plus references.<br /> <br /> Local Transportation: B=
uses to New Paltz or Kingston, local cab. Or drive up yourself. It's about =
a 2 hr drive from the GWB.<br /> <br /> Looking forward to hear from you.<b=

r /> My wonderful live/work apartment is available for sublet for the month=
 of July. <br /> <br /> Excellent studio space AND a lovely place to live. =
I will have the  studio cleared out so it can be used- as long as materials=
 are not  hazardous as this is a residential building. Great for a couple, =
too-  the apartment is big- about 700 sq feet. There is a private landing a=
nd  staircase to the apartment that is good for storing bikes, shoes etc.  =
Great, spacious well-appointed kitchen with lots of counter space and a  ni=
ce small dining area with a table that seats 4 (not pictured). <br /> <br /=
> Located on 32nd st on the Greenwood Heights/Sunset Park border, lots of  =
artists and artist studios in close proximity, awesome tacos in Sunset  Par=
k, walking distance to S Slope bars and restaurants, and very close  to gre=
at trains (the D, N, R at 36th st): 2 stops on the express train  to the lo=
wer east side. Top floor with lots of windows, a skylight and  wonderful of=
 natural light. <br /> <br /> This is a 3-apartment building with great art=
ists as the best neighbors  ever! Patrick and Jennie (2nd floor) have start=
ed an awesome temporary  exhibition space in the garage of our building, an=
d they are very  welcoming ambassadors:<br /> http://www.sadiehalieprojects=
.com. <br /> <br /> Must be into living with and taking care of a very low-=
maintenance,  adorable cat. If you like cats this is a good situation for y=
ou- she is  very easy to take care of and very loving. Also must be a non-s=
moker.  There is a non-smoking policy in the building including fire escape=
,  stoop etc. <br /> <br /> Rent for the whole space including fast Wifi an=
d all utilities plus use  of a very powerful AC is 1400. We've knocked the =
total expense down  because of the cat-sitting, and because we are really h=
oping to  accommodate artists or friends of friends who need a place to lan=
d.  Anyone interested is welcome to email me brickersusan@gmail.com.<br /><=

lks through the door feels right at  home. :) This is a one bedroom apartme=
nt, with bright colors through  out. It receives good light throughout the =
day and is very close to  Prospect Park and the B/Q subway. It's about 25 m=
inutes to Union Sq.  downtown Manhattan. Inside it's all hardwood floors, f=
ull bathroom,  large closet space, full eat in kitchen with all new and wor=
king  appliances. A chef's dream for sure. Cable and internet connection co=
mes  along with the apt. Laundry is in the building and the super is on sit=
e  incase anything unexpected were to happen. My neighbors are kind and  mo=
re than generous to help with anything. The apartment is located in  Leffer=
ts Garden Brooklyn. It's within walking distance to Prospect Park  and very=
 close to Brooklyn Botanic Gardens, Brooklyn Museum, and  Brooklyn Library.=
 This place is ideal for a couple or for a small young  family. It's 1200 s=
quare ft. and just the spot you want to come home to  at the end of the day=
. New restaurants and businesses are popping up and  overall is a very frie=
ndly safe neighborhood. Trust me you want to stay  here! I only ask that wh=
ile you stay, you water the plants talk to them  every once in a while and =
feed my fish. If one or two of the fish  decide to move on to wetter pastur=
es thats ok too. Also I am a member of  the Botanical Gardens and the Brook=
lyn Museum and will be leaving those  passes for you! I'm asking 2250$ a mo=
nth and that includes all  utilities and security incase anything unexpecte=
d were to happen that  needs repair.<br /><br /> <a style=3D"color: black;"=

 We live in a spacious railroad style apartment, which has a bedroom with  =
a queen sized bed sandwiched in between two living room/study areas, a  spa=

be converted nicely into another bedroom with our extra  mattress, room div=
iders and curtains. Our apartment boasts an abundance  of books, records, a=

 and plenty of storage space for your belongings,  so you don't have to liv=
e out of a suitcase.<br /> <br /> We're hoping to find someone who would be=
 fine with feeding our two  cats. The cats are gentle and affectionate, nev=
er angsty, and have the  nice habit of following us from room to room to fi=
nd a quiet resting  spot near us while we work. Their upkeep is minimal. Ho=
wever, if you're  interested in the space but not so much the cats, please =
let us know as  we can make other arrangements for them (and would clean th=
e space  readily of all cat hair traces should you be allergic).<br /> <br =
/> Our place is just a block from shady and lush McGolrick Park, which has =
 the best misty fountain to run through on a hot day. There's also a  farme=
rs market on Sundays and a grocery store on the corner. This  neighborhood =
is tranquil, with several nice restaurants and cafes (we'll  leave a map of=
 our favorite spots) in the immediate vicinity as well as  a laundromat on =
the block. A 15 minute walk brings you to the hubbub of  Manhattan Ave, wit=

you have an apartment or room to rent or sub-let,  or if you have a house/a=

cking and organizing. We will rely on you to  keep our location looking exc=
iting and enticing during the summer and  early fall.<br /> <br /> Previous=
