A semi-private space is available April 1st (or sooner, currently vacant)=
 for sublease in my studio, approximately 200 square feet for $525, utili=
ties included (heat &amp; electricity). The ceilings are 11 feet high, so=

people - my space is in the back and completely private with a door, whil=
e your space is in the middle, divided from the other studio with a parti=
al wall, which goes all the way up to the ceiling. There are no windows, =
but abundant wall space and a small storage loft. Perfect for a painter. =

The charming space has one exposed brick wall, and original details of wo=
od ceiling, beams and floor. It feels very comfortable and homey in there=
, great place to work. The photos feature my previous studiomates&#39; st=
uff, but it&#39;s best to take a look at it in person and see how you wou=
ld set it up yourself.

There is a freight elevator, mailbox, slop sink, clean bathrooms, and 24-=
hour access to building. Many artists and creative professionals in the b=
uilding.

Amazing, prime location, just 2 blocks from the G at Greenpoint Ave and w=
alking distance to tons of great bars, shops, and restaurants.

I prefer someone with a quiet practice - no woodworking (occasional is ok=
), loud machines, or toxic materials. I require first month&#39;s rent pl=
us 2 months security deposit. The lease is for one year, but if you need =
to leave before then, you can give me 45 days notice.=20

ll

The Space
Looking for somebody to share my 3rd floor studio in The Invisible Dog Ar=
t Center (www.theinvisibledog.org). The total space is about 9&#39; x 23&=
#39; with an east-facing window that gets great morning light. It looks o=
ut onto a garden which you would have access to in the spring. Ceilings a=
re 10.5&#39; high and the space is fully enclosed.

Rent is flat rate and includes all bills.

The building has great energy.  There are about 25 professional and motiv=
ated artists (sculptors, jewelry, illustrators, painters...) in the build=
ing and there are diverse events happening in the exhibition space year r=
ound.

Amenities: high-speed internet (150 Mbps download, 150 Mbps upload).  Stu=
dio has fridge in the space.  For storage, there is some available loft s=
pace and tall school lockers for you to secure your things.  There are tw=
o bathrooms on the floor and an elevator for moving heavy items.  1/2 blo=
ck from Bergen Stop on the F/G train.  Easy to get to, great restaurants,=
 coffee shops etc.

Me
I am a freelancer photographer.  I have been in the building for 6 years.=
  I work here almost every day if I am not on a shoot.  I generally work =
at my desk.  Very easy going.  www.malcolmbrown.net

You
You would be a part-time or full-time writer, videographer, programmer, a=
rtist etc. who spends most of your time working desk-bound.  Unfortunatel=
y, the space is not ideal for an artist who needs a lot of space to build=
 or construct something.  If you&#39;re interested, please send me inform=
ation about yourself.  Looking forward to meeting you.

Email is preferred.

Thanks,
Malcolm

Shared but Private, Bright Artist Space
Available: Mar 03, 2015

Your space is 10&#39; x 30&#39;  with 7&#39; of windows and great light (=
a desk fits nicely under them). Rent includes everything (electricity, he=
at and garbage pick-up).  I use fans but have an AC if needed. The ceilin=
g is 13&#39; high, racks and storage are already built-out, well-heated, =
24/7 access, freight elevator, parking space extra. It&#39;s a profession=
ally run, safe building of artist and small businesses. The lease expires=
 in September but I (we?) will probably renew because it&#39;s a good, re=
asonable price. Old bodegas, new restaurants and a grocery store is close=
 by.  Mixed neighborhood but feels quite safe.
I&#39;m a professional painter/muralist (oil and water based), NPR is usu=
ally on but I&#39;m open to other thoughts.  There is a white gauze curta=
in dividing the space so it feels quite private.  I don&#39;t work too la=
te although many in the building do work evenings. Easy going, shared fri=
g, across the hall from bathrooms and slop sink.  I ride my bike daily an=
d park inside the fenced parking lot.=20

 In Gorgeous and Homey Three-Story Brownstone
Available: Mar 01, 2015 through Oct 01, 2015

Hi,=20

It is with real regret that I must let go of this room and greater home. =
Words and pictures truly do not do this unique space justice; it is witho=
ut a doubt the highest quality living experience I&#39;ve had in the City=
. I can&#39;t count the number a times I&#39;ve been asked, &quot;You act=
ually live here?&quot;=20

I&#39;ll begin with the room. It&#39;s enormous, measuring at 19ft x 17ft=
. There is also a closet area that is 8ft x 3ft, bringing the total to 34=
7sqft. It feels like a studio apartment and easily holds a bed, a desk (I=
 work from home), and a couch / living room area, with plenty of empty sp=
ace left over. There are three large windows that let in tons of sunlight=
 throughout the day and three closets. One wall is completely lined with =
shelves for an extraordinary amount of storage and decorating space. Addi=
tionally, I will be looking to sell my bed and all of my furniture if you=
 would like the room furnished at a discount. =20

Now for the house. It&#39;s a gorgeous brownstone with parquet hardwood f=
loors, intricate molding, a decorative fireplace and tons of additional t=
ouches that give it indescribable character. Architecturally, they don&#3=
9;t make many apartments like this in NYC anymore. There are three storie=
s connected by a beautiful spiraling wooden staircase. A huge plus is tha=
t all of the common areas are located on the first floor so noise is neve=
r an issue. These include a sunroom / parlor, a sizable living room / mov=
ie room, a gigantic dining room (with an indoor bike rack) and a kitchen.=
 But my favorite part is the backyard. During the warmer months, nothing =
beats gardening in our three raised vegetable beds, grilling &amp; eating=
 on the outside table, and playing cornhole on our homemade set. Oh and t=
here&#39;s also a laundry room with a washer and dryer, too!

There are a total of five bedrooms rooms (including the master) and one g=
uest room; two on the second story and three on the third story. The mast=
er bedroom is on the second story. Each story has a bathroom (two total),=
 so you will be sharing a bathroom with just one other person. Her name i=
s Ope and she&#39;s really great. Very chill with an infectious laugh. I&=
#39;m the only one who&#39;s home on a regular basis due to my work and m=
ost of the time the house is empty. Even on weeknights and weekends, ther=
e&#39;s rarely ever more than two roommates at a time in common areas. Ev=
eryone is a mid-to-late 20-something working professional (elementary tea=
cher, clothing designer, comedy writer, &amp; landscaper) who tends to be=
 out and about. When home, everyone is extremely respectful of everyone e=
lse&#39;s space and time. It usually stays pretty low-key though dinners =
are hosted, movies are watched and fun is had.

The building supervisor is also really great. He makes our life a lot eas=
ier. Anytime an issue arises, he&#39;s on it within 24 hours. He lives do=
wnstairs but we never see him unless we call.=20

The apartment is located in Crown Heights, about a block and a half from =
Franklin (at St. Marks Ave and Rogers). We are close to grocery stores, r=
estaurants, bars, coffee shops, bike shops, yoga gyms and tons of other r=
esources. Brooklyn Public Library, Grand Army Plaza Farmer&#39;s Market, =
and Prospect Park are a pleasant 1.2 mile walk from the house. There&#39;=
s also quick access to the following trains: A, C, 2, 3, 4, 5, Shuttle, a=
nd lirr.=20

Our lease began on October 1st of last year. You will replace my girlfrie=
nd and I on it. Everyone in the house will sign a new contract expiring o=
n October 1st of this year. You will then have the option of renewing the=
 lease for a full year. You get to avoid the painful broker&#39;s fee, bu=
t will be expected to provide last month&#39;s rent and a security deposi=
t.=20

Who you are: an individual or couple preferably in your 20s or early 30s.=
 Everyone in the house is respectful, kind, and no-drama. We&#39;re looki=
ng for someone with a similar demeanor. Though not everyone knew each oth=
er before living together, everyone gets along. It&#39;s not unusual to j=
oin in on another roommate&#39;s BBQ, board game or watching NBA. It&#39;=
s a very warm and comfortable home and that&#39;s highly valued by everyo=
ne. So the right fit will not only be financially credible (you will be a=
sked to submit the typical documentation proving your credibility) but al=
so have generally good vibes.=20

The room is available March 1st though I can be flexible with your move-i=
n date. I will only respond to serious inquiries. No pets unfortunately. =
If you have any questions at all, please feel free to reach out. Thanks a=
 ton and I look forward to meeting you!=20

Best,
Nick

We are looking to fill a room that will be available April 1st. We have t=
he top two floors of a gorgeous 110-year-old 3-story Victorian house in D=
itmas Park, complete with backyard, front yard, front porch (with a porch=
 swing!), two full bathrooms (one with a clawed-foot tub), and two friend=
ly cats. Our neighborhood feels very much like a small town in the middle=
 of the city, we hear crickets at night, cicadas during the day, are surr=
ounded by trees, but food and transportation are at the end of the street=
. We have pizza, 24-hour delis, Chinese and sushi half a block away, bars=
, cafes and restaurants around the corner, a food coop and a farmers mark=
et at the end of the street, and are located just 3 blocks south of Prosp=

There are currently three of us (all female) living together looking for =
our fourth, dudes and dudettes welcome. About us: we are working and resp=

minded individuals to share our home. We all have associations with the a=
rts, (preschool teacher/graphic designer, writer/babysitter, and queer-mi=
nded artist/french teacher), and enjoy cooking, gardening, and bicycling.=
 Because this is an old house we do need to be respectful of it (100-year=
 old floors, stained glass windows, etc.). We believe in doing dishes and=
 keeping our common areas and bathrooms clean (we do weekly cleanings and=
 buy communal household items) but also cracking open a bottle of wine an=
d some Netflix if we happen to all be home at the same time, throwing occ=
asional dinner parties, and barbecues. Cigarette smokers must go outside,=
 and no couples or additional pets. Our landlord is very responsive and t=
akes good care of the house.

$1,400.00 Per Month, Central Williamsburg/ Southside, Brooklyn, 1,400 sq.=
 ft., Large, sunny bedroom (furnished) in 2 bedroom loft - Prime Williams=
burg
Available: Apr 05, 2015 through Aug 31, 2015

I am looking for a quiet, courteous, responsible roommate for a 3-6 month=
 term to share my duplex loft apartment with.

The Room For Rent: 350 sq ft (33 sq meters) room in a large duplex loft; =
lots of light; laminate hardwood floors; exposed brick walls; 2 large win=
dows facing east with Brooklyn skyline views and morning sun; simply furn=
ished with full sized bed, desk, chairs, couch, shelves, wardrobe, chest =
of drawers, TV/DVD/ cable channels with HBO and IFC.
The room is divided into 3 areas: sleeping/office/ lounge area. It is sep=
arated from the rest of the apartment by a regular door and has the size =
of a New York studio apartment.
All shelves and closets are empty - ample of room to store your belonging=
s. The room has bedding, linen and towels - if you don&#39;t have your ow=
n.

The Loft: two bedroom Duplex (1,400 sq ft / 130 sq m) with lots of sun; t=
he bathroom, living area and open kitchen (with dishwasher) are downstair=
s and the 2 bedrooms upstairs; the loft is on the upper floors of a conve=
rted industrial warehouse with nice river- and Brooklyn views; washer/dry=
er available in building two floors up or drop-off laundry one block away=
; wireless internet (not super fast but functional); Direct TV; ceiling f=
ans in all rooms; no pets in apartment. This is NOT one of the newly buil=
t luxury buildings in the neighborhood but rather an original warehouse s=
pace with a great community of long-term Williamsburg residents, artists =
and people from all corners of the world.
=20
Located in the southside of Williamsburg near the East River with the clo=
sest train station at Bedford Ave (L-train) ; there are lots of restauran=
ts, movie theaters, bars, clubs, coffee shops and yoga studios in walking=
 distance. Several supermarkets and health food stores are within a 5 blo=
ck radius. Very safe, fun neighborhood.
=20
I am looking for ONE person who wants to move in temporarily without thei=
r entire household. There is plenty of room to store your belongings but =
since the room is fully furnished you would need to put your own furnitur=
e into storage.

It is very important to me to share the loft with only one person. It is =
a big space but there is only 1 bathroom. Please - no couples, no out-of-=
town guests, no live-in boy/girlfriends, no pets.=20

I am looking for someone who is easy-going, respectful, free of drama and=
 parties outside the house. I think it is best for both of us if you are =
also fully employed outside the house or a serious graduate student.=20

Rent: $1,400/ month plus 1/2 electric bill=20
All other utilities are included (gas/internet/ Direct TV).

The loft is heated by forced air from a geothermal heat exchange. These m=
achines run on electricity. In the winter months your share might run fro=
m $80-$125/month. The rest of the year it runs $40-$60/month per person.=20=

Air-conditioning: there is air-conditioning in the apartment but i almost=
 never use it. The wind from the East River as well as the ceiling fans h=
ave provided ample relief from the heat in the pas. If you feel hot easil=
y, there is the possibility to run the A/C just in your room. Use of the =
A/C unit would increase the monthly electricity bill for the summer.=20

About myself: I am originally from Germany, female, 52 , non-smoker; inte=
rested in the outdoors, arts, music, traveling, bicycling. I have lived f=
or a really long time here in Williamsburg and I work in TV news producti=
on.=20
Since I really enjoy coming home to a quiet apartment where i can just ch=
ill out after work, I am looking for someone who is equally inclined and =
appreciates a comfortable, calm space.
I am not home that much as I work most weekdays in Manhattan. In the summ=
er I like to go out to the beaches on Long Island. I also spend a fair am=
ount of time with friends outside the house. The apartment has a well-siz=
ed kitchen and you&#39;ll have your own counter-sized refrigerator. I ten=
d to prepare my meals at home but I&#39;m not much of a cook.

Please let me know how long you are planning to stay and some information=
 about yourself.
Thanks for your interest.

There is a $700 deposit to secure the space which I will happily return w=
hen you move out.

Transportation:
L-train: Bedford Avenue. One stop to Manhattan.=20
J/M - train: Marcy Avenue. One stop to Manhattan.
Location: central Williamsburg - Southside. Near East River and Williamsb=

$1,050.00 Per Month, Bushwick, Brooklyn, 160 sf sq. ft., $925 or $1,050 -=
-2 Large, Private Bedrooms Available in Huge, New Co-op Loft, Creative &a=
mp; Fun Vibe!
Available: Mar 01, 2015

We have 2 private, unfurnished bedrooms available for rent in a large lof=
t made up of multiple bedrooms. Both of the rooms are available for Mar 1=
st move-in or mid-month. Each room can be rented by 1 person, no sharing.=
 The rooms feature baseboard heat, hardwood floors, and high ceilings. On=
e room is over 150 sf with large outdoor windows for $1,050/mo. The other=
 is slightly smaller and has a window into the hallway, which has an outs=
ide window, plus it has an upper loft storage area for $925/mo base rent.=
 See photos and descriptions.

We are the designers and caretakers of this loft residence who are sublea=
sing its bedrooms. If there is a maintenance issue, we&#39;re on it. If y=
ou want custom shelving or a custom room loft (for a bed/storage), we can=
 build it for you at a reasonable rate. Or feel free to DiY.

The bedrooms are part of the shared loft that is the whole first floor of=
 a converted warehouse. The loft is a new, high-quality buildout and feat=
ures 11&#39; ceilings throughout; a double kitchen with new appliances (2=
 stoves/ovens, 2 fridges/freezers, 2 sinks) a dishwasher, aluminum counte=
rs; 2 large, full bathrooms with Roman tile and glass showers, plus a 1/2=
 bathroom and a laundry room. There is also a large common area with tabl=
es, and 24/7 rooftop access. Free WiFi.

Roommates are responsible and creative professionals and students, mostly=
 people in their 20s, though some are older. We accept people of all type=
s and ages here. Pets are discouraged but it&#39;s a case by case basis. =
No pets live here currently. The other 3 floors of the building are made =
into of similar lofts with people (many artists and musicians) in their 3=
0s and 40s who&#39;ve been living there longer. It&#39;s a good building =
and the loft has a pleasant and lively vibe. We are looking for an eager =
and compatible roommate for those already in the other rooms. This is a c=
hill spot not a party place.

Loft is located in heart of NYC&#39;s edgiest neighborhood: Bushwick. The=
 coolest community and best neighborhood for everything! Shops at the Loo=
m, coffee shops, yoga, hip restaurants, bars, music, galleries, diy space=
s...everything. Quick ride to Manhattan and great location in Brooklyn.

We are asking for a minimum 6 month commitment with first, last and depos=
it upfront, up to 1-yr lease. Utilities and the weekly cleaning service a=
re extra, but are equally shared and reasonably priced (about $50/month t=
otal). Email or text if you&#39;d like more info or want to schedule a vi=
ewing.

$900.00 Per Month, Chinatown, New York, Artist living in heart of Chinato=
wn seeks roommate
Available: Mar 31, 2015

A room is opening up at the end of March. As of now the rent is about 800=
 per person. I have lived here for over four years and my roommate is mov=
ing out. I am an artist with a studio out in BK and I work as an assistan=
t during the day. I don&#39;t stay in too often and I go out to a lot of =
functions after work. I&#39;m looking for a roommate who is relatively qu=
iet and stays busy. But still knows how to have a good time. It would be =
cool if we were around the same age. Early to late 20&#39;s.=20

The perks are that its a great area and super convenient. You can basical=
ly get on any subway you want along canal. The F train is not too far and=
 the BD line is on grand street. Close to great restaurants and bars. All=
 within mins walk from the building. There is a coin operated laundry roo=
m. Rooftop access. And the building is well maintained.=20

However it is a 6 floor walk up. The rooms are small and there is almost =
no common area. There is a small kitchen and bathroom by the door. But no=
t very much space to just hang out. It&#39;s not really made for home bod=
ies or those who like to bring the party home. Both of which I do not do.=
=20

I usually keep to myself but am very friendly and go out at night and def=
initely don&#39;t have a problem with you joining events and outings with=
 my friends and me. I&#39;m looking for a better living environment compa=
red to what I have with my current roommate. Chill and being able to be e=
ven a little social would be good for the both of us.=20

You must be able to be approved by management by passing a credit check a=
nd showing proof of employment. If you have any questions please feel fre=
e to email me!=20

$800.00 Per Month, Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, Sunny room in beautiful 3 bedroom =
apt
Available: Mar 15, 2015 through Dec 31, 2015

$800 rent / $800 deposit=20
Utilities not included (internet, gas, electric)
Renting room for 10 months with a possibility to extend=20

Hi everyone,

We&#39;re two women living in a beautiful three bedroom apartment in bed-=
stuy, close to the G and C trains, and the B43 and B52 buses. There are a=
 few coffee shops and restaurants on our street, and a few blocks away on=
 Bedford there are plenty of other offerings.

We&#39;re studious, vibrant, considerate, kind, tidy, and friendly, and a=
re searching for someone to join our family style home. We have a welcomi=
ng and open shared common area, a full kitchen and one and a half bathroo=
ms. We&#39;re looking for someone who can commit to the entirety of the r=
ental period (10 months).

We&#39;re renting the third bedroom, located in the front of the apartmen=
t, which has warm southern exposure and extra privacy. The room doesn&#39=
;t have a closet, but there is a clothing rack, and you&#39;re welcome to=
 add shelves or a wall unit. The room is 12&#39; long and 6&#39; wide. It=
 is a bit narrow, but long and spacious.

Currently, the room fits a full-sized bed, dresser, night table, and clot=
hing rack, but also has space for a small desk. There is extra storage in=
 the basement for any miscellaneous items or boxes that you&#39;d like to=
 store outside the room. (Good for books, suitcases, etc. Furniture is no=
t storable there because of mold). Also, there is free use of the washer =
and dryer unit in the basement.

The apartment is fully furnished, but the room is bare, so it is ideal fo=
r someone who has little to move. (We could however use some art for the =
living / dining area. Our current roommate is taking his with him.) Also,=
 we&#39;d like to replace the rug and paint the walls, so if you&#39;re u=
p for any of that, your input would be welcome.

This apartment is great for someone who enjoys roommate camaraderie; shar=
ing household responsibilities; is considerate of other people&#39;s time=
 and space; and is generally happy and easy to get along with.

Please email me (Joanna) with a little about yourself: job, schedule, and=
 if you feel up to it, hobbies and interests.

No pets, no couples.=20
Sorry :-(

(There is cat litter in the bathroom picture, but the roommate leaving is=
 taking his cat with him, so the apt. will be pet free.)

$908.00 Per Month, Bushwick, Brooklyn, 120 sq. ft., 1 Bedroom in a 2 BR A=
pt., 3 Blocks from Jefferson L in Bushwick!
Available: Mar 01, 2015


Hi my name is Tom. I am a 32 year-old artist, poet, and full-time booksto=
re employee. I&#39;m passionate about the written word (poetry, fiction, =
philosophy, everything) and edit a literary journal with some friends.=20=


I&#39;m looking for a roommate to fill an open, unfurnished bedroom in my=
 2 BR apartment in Bushwick, Brooklyn located 3 blocks (5 min. walk) from=
 the Jefferson L Train stop.

Rent is $908 per month plus 1/2 utilities (electricity/internet/cooking g=
as). This usually totals $60-75. The bedroom is 10 x 12 ft., and can easi=
ly fit a full or queen-sized bed, desk, and dresser, with room to spare. =
 A large living room separates the bedrooms. The kitchen is its own area =
with ample cupboard space, fridge, stove, the usual. The building itself =
is gated, with a courtyard connecting 4 apartment spaces. Neighbors are a=
 mix of families who&#39;ve been living in the neighborhood their whole l=
ives and newer arrivals.  Excellent heating in the winter. I don&#39;t ev=
en turn on my radiator.

I&#39;ve lived in the building for many years and have come to deeply lov=
e the neighborhood. Bushwick is certainly all the rage these days, with m=
any new bars, restaurants, coffee shops, and art/community spaces opening=
 up constantly. In the past year, Strangeways, a coffee shop serving some=
 of the best coffee I have ever tasted opened practically next door. Othe=
r neighborhood fixtures include: Northeast Kingdom, Union Pizza, The Rook=
ery, Montana&#39;s Trail House, Cafe Ghia, The Bathaus, The Bodega, and m=
any more.

I&#39;m looking for someone who is easy-going and reliable. I&#39;m quiet=
 and spend a lot of time in my room reading and writing, but am also down=
 to hang out and socialize from time to time. I&#39;m tobacco-friendly (I=
 smoke). I would prefer no pets, but am open to cats. Simply, I&#39;m loo=
king for someone chill and pleasant, with a reliable job who can pay the =
rent on time.=20

Proof of employment preferred. Total move-in cost will be first months re=
nt + one month&#39;s security totaling $1816.

I&#39;d love to have someone interested in staying long-term (a year woul=
d be great but I&#39;m open to other longish time-frames) if everything c=
licks. The apartment is rent-stabilized, so annual increases are determin=
ed by a percentage, and should keep the rent reasonable going forward.

Contact me via email with your name, phone #, a brief description of your=
self (employment, interests, etcetera) and links to any social media prof=
iles you&#39;re willing to share. Thanks.

$1,217.27 Per Month, Clinton Hill/Bed Stuy, Brooklyn, Bedroom available i=
n two-bed with private backyard!
Available: Apr 01, 2015 through Jun 30, 2015

I am searching for someone to sublet my room in a two-bedroom apartment f=
or the months of April, May and June. The bedroom is well-sized with ampl=
e storage space. The bedroom can come furnished or unfurnished for the du=
ration of the sublet. The apartment is on the first floor and has a priva=
te backyard! During the spring months the backyard is ideal for cookouts =
and gardening. It&#39;s currently covered in snow, hence the lack of pict=
ure, but I&#39;m happy to send you some should you ask.

You would share the apartment with my current roommate (female, late 20s)=
 and her indoor/outdoor cat - both of whom are completely lovely.

The apartment is located in Clinton Hill/Bed Stuy - easy walk to the Fran=
klin S/C and Classon G trains. The neighborhood has so many incredible co=
ffee shops and restaurants --- &quot;Dough&quot; is a short walk away! Cl=
ementine Bakery - Speedy Romeo - Alice&#39;s Arbor - The Outpost - Calaca=
 ---- all within just a few blocks. The Bed Stuy Y is three blocks away a=
nd is an amazing and affordable facility!=20

If you love the place after 3 months - you could sign a 1-year lease come=
 July with the management company.

The room is $1217.27 per month and utilities (internet, electric, gas) ar=
e between $90-100 monthly, which you would split half with my roommate.

I am also open to a March 15th move-in and we could split the March rent =
in half.

Please shoot an e-mail if you&#39;re interested!=20

$775.00 Per Month, Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, 56 sq. ft., Sunny, peaceful room w=
ith a tree, a closet, and cats in the hall (but not the apartment)
Available: Mar 07, 2015 through Aug 26, 2016

The Room: It&#39;s a smallish room, 5&#39;11&quot; by 11&#39;5.&quot; It =
will fit a full sized bed and a dresser easily and it has its own closet =
and a big window that gets direct morning sunshine. The view is a tree an=
d a brownstone out on Jefferson Ave. The rent is $775/month plus utilitie=
s (Electric, Gas, and Internet).

Your Roomate: I&#39;m 29, a Graduate Student working on a PhD in US Histo=
ry, a professor at John Jay College and also a tour guide and researcher =
at several Museums around the city.  I am an active member in the Brookly=
n Jewish community and I like to host meals every other month or so on Fr=
iday nights. I love running, biking, cooking and folk music and go to mus=
eums and live performances when I can.

I&#39;m home some days studying, but I prefer to work at the library when=
 I can, and I have class/go out many evenings. I tend to  go to bed at 12=
 and wake up at 7, and shower in the mornings after a run. I&#39;d say I&=
#39;m a 7.5/10 on the cleanliness scale. I like kitchen and table surface=
s to be wiped down and dishes to be done within 24 hours of use, but I on=
ly tend to deep clean every other month.

I&#39;ve been living in Brooklyn for eight years, though only in this apa=
rtment since August. I was looking for a 1 bd but fell in love with this =
2 bdr.  I&#39;ve been sub-letting the extra room on a short-term basis bu=
t am now looking for someone to stay until the end of the lease (August 2=
6) with the option to join the lease starting then.

The Apartment: The apartment is the full top (3rd) floor of a brownstone.=
 It&#39;s been renovated, but not gut renovated and if you&#39;re looking=
 for a sparkly new apartment, this isn&#39;t the place. My landlady&#39;s=
 great; she&#39;s from Jamaica and her granddaughter lives in the basemen=
t. She&#39;s been extremely responsive and accommodating. I made a video =
tour which I can share with you if you&#39;re interested.

While the apartment is fairly set up, I&#39;m flexible about making chang=
es and want the new roommate to feel at home. So whether that&#39;s shift=
ing furniture, art, morning schedules, cleaning priorities, whatever, I&#=
39;m eager to work together with the right person to make this beautiful =
space from mine into our home.=20
=20
The Neighborhood:  The apartment is in the heart of Bed-Stuy, which is a =
fascinating neighborhood that&#39;s up-and-coming while at the same time =
has a true sense of community. I know my neighbors and sit out on the sto=
op talking with them in nice weather. It&#39;s an 8 block walk from the C=
 train at Kingston-Throop (one stop after Nostrand Ave, and a 15 min walk=
 from Nostrand.)

There are plentiful laundromats a block away in every direction, a coffee=
 shop on both Tompkins and Throop, a fancy bar and a hip bar both on Tomp=
kins, a yoga studio a block away, nice restaurants and Jerk Chicken place=
s. The B43 bus (on the corner) will take you North to Greenpoint or South=
 to the Park. The B26 on Halsey (2 blocks away) will take you to Clinton =
Hill and Downtown Brooklyn.

About the space:

The apartment has a large open kitchen and living room with a island coun=
ter top separation. The living room gets a lot of sunlight in the morning=
s. All the rooms and bathroom are off a long hallway. The open room is a =
large square with a closet, extra storage space above, and a window facin=
g a courtyard/between buildings space. It will easily hold a queen sized =
bed, desk, dresser. There may be a bed to use, if you need one.

As you walk down the hall, there is a hall closet, then the sunny bathroo=
m. The back of the apartment has the other 2 rooms, my room and the offic=
e.=20

About me briefly:

31 year old with a 9 - 6 job in the city. I live with my 45 lb, 3 year ol=
d pit mix -- so you must love living with a dog -- and she is very lovabl=
e. I&#39;ve been in the apartment for a while now so it feels very much l=
ike home. My current roommate is moving out of Brooklyn so the furniture =
arrangement and art on the walls, as seen in the photos -will be shifting=
 a bit. I&#39;m looking for someone low key, who doesn&#39;t have a lot o=
f stuff to move in with, and needs a comfortable, quiet temporary situati=
on. =20

Available: Apr 01, 2015 through Apr 30, 2015

I&#39;m subletting my sunny and spacious room in Greenpoint while I&#39;m=
 away for the month of April.  The room has a very comfortable full-sized=
 mattress, a futon sofa that folds out into a full-sized bed, a desk nook=
 for writing and plenty of books, records, and plants to keep you company=
.  There is also a door in your room that leads to a private backyard (we=
 share the space with our downstairs neighbors but they are hardly ever h=
ome.) You will share a bathroom and a well-equipped kitchen with my lovel=
y roommate, a filmmaker and all-around good person.  She has a separate e=
ntrance to her room on the other side of the apartment, so you both will =
have lots of privacy.  Greenpoint is a wonderful neighborhood, especially=
 in the Spring.  Laundry, two grocery stores, the G train, and plenty of =
bars, restaurants and cafes are all within two or three blocks of the apa=
rtment.=20

$1,250.00 Per Month, Bushwick, Brooklyn, Spacious bedroom + Separate Offi=
ce available!
Available: Mar 10, 2015

Hello! I am taking some time away from the city and am looking for someon=
e to fill my beloved bedroom long-term, beginning March 10th (March 15th =
move-in OK too). You&#39;ll be living with my best friend. Our apartment =
is the top of a house on a cute tree-lined street in Bushwick, surrounded=
 by a great community of neighbors we have grown to love over the many ye=
ars we have lived here. We are looking for someone who will respect the s=
pace as well as the families around our home.

My bedroom has 3 large windows and gets plenty of sunlight. The room real=
ly is huge, look at all the stuff I can keep in it!  A gorgeous, massive =
 mirror with original molding is in the center, adding character to the r=
oom that you wont find in new construction.  The pictured armoire can be =
moved around to fit your style, and you still can fit a queen size bed, a=
nother dresser, and/or a little seating area for reading or a yoga mat.=20=

=20
Bedroom:=20
	Size:  17.5ft X 11.5ft=20
	Separate Entrance=20
	Lots of light with tall windows facing street
	Huge Decorative Mirror
	Standing armoire for hanging clothes and plenty of closets throughout ap=
artment to share
	Unfurnished (Im selling a full size bed and/or bedframe if you need one)=

	Folding doors open the room to the dining room, but other bedroom is on =
opposite side of the apt so privacy/noise has never been an issue.

The bedroom also connects to a separate shared Office/Studio Space (10ft =
X 7.5ft) w/ additional separate entrance from hallway. My current roommat=
e tends to work in other areas of the apartment, so shes willing to give =
up the window and help organize to fit your needs.=20

	Rent: $1250 + Split Utilities (electric, internet, gas); Heat &amp; Hot =
Water Included
	1st months (pro-rated) + month security  to move in
	No Pets/ No Party Parties (Landlords Rules  she lives on premises) but g=
uests are welcome for things like dinner parties or movie nights
	No Couples/ No Bevers of Broad City Situations
	Charming entrance with skylight and exposed brick
	1 Bathroom to share w/ my very clean roomie
	Kitchen, living, and dining room fully furnished=20

Like I said, youll be living with my best friend. Very chill. Freelancer =
and production whiz sometimes working from home sometimes long hours outs=
ide of the house.  Late 20s, very creative and social individual but also=
 enjoys peace and quiet / privacy. Seriously, the best roommate ever. Jus=
t meet her and you&#39;ll see, weve successfully lived together for over =
5 years.

First month&#39;s rent and security deposit due up front. The rent is due=
 at the beginning of every month - since this is a mid-month move-in, the=
 first month will be pro-rated accordingly.

This apartment has been our home for a very long time. Well be doing some=
 deep cleaning and paint touchups prior to move in date, but my roommate =
will also want to work with you to make sure the vibe and dcor of the apa=
rtment make you feel just as at home as we have over the years.

Thanks!

good light. These rooms overlook the backyard (so less street noise). My =
bedroom is on the opposite side of the apartment and has its own entrance=
. The rent is $1,250 for an individual or $1,400 for a couple. Utilities =
would be split evenly. The apartment was newly renovated, all kitchen app=
liances are new and there&#39;s lots of storage space in the kitchen and =
the bathroom. I just moved in this past weekend.

Crown Heights is an awesome neighborhood; very &quot;trendy,&quot; fun, a=
nd with tons of beautiful architecture. The apartment is one block away f=
rom a large grocery store, a laundromat, coffee shop, restaurants, and su=
bway. Minutes walk from the Brooklyn Museum, and Franklin Ave with its ma=
ny bars, restaurants, boutiques, etc.=20

About me: I&#39;m a 30-year old artist and animal lover. I manage a dog w=
alking business and non-profit rescue group. I have my own small dog name=
d Pinto Bean (who comes to work with me every day) and a cool blind cat n=
amed Chas. You&#39;d get to enjoy some animal company with no obligations=
 attached. Please note that the pets would not have access to your half o=
f the apartment (your half is behind a closed door). I&#39;ve lived in Br=
ooklyn for 12 years and have had various roommies throughout that time, a=
nd have never had roommie issues. I like a laid-back home.

About you: You need to be responsible, animal-friendly, clean, and pleasa=
nt.=20

I would ask that you be added to the apartment&#39;s lease. First month +=
 security to move in. Available for immediate move-in.

$1,600.00 Per Month, central, Vienna, Austria, 3500 sq. ft., Live and wor=
k in Vienna this summer
Available: Apr 01, 2015 through Sept 30, 2015

I will sublet my Vienna, Austria place for three to six months, available=
 April 1 to September 30.=20

Vienna offers an incredibly high quality of life, and is an amazing place=
 to work. There are so many great museums and a lively local art scene, a=
nd very good food. It is also a very central location from which to make =
very affordable excursions throughout Europe by car, bus, train or plane.=
 This would be a great opportunity for someone who is preparing a show fo=
r a European gallery.

I would prefer a single person or a couple, but two people could easily s=
hare and each have private bedrooms and separate studios. The whole space=
 is about 350 square meters (=3D3700 sf) and it is 1400 Euro a month. The=
 location is very central, and very close to all public transport. It is =
right by the French Embassy between Karlsplatz and Schwarzenbergplatz. Th=
is is the best time of year to be in the space, and the location is amazi=
ng. The space stays very cool in the summer, even on the hottest days. Th=
e studio has a glass ceiling, almost 5 meters high, and is a great place =
for painting. There is a treadmill but at this time of year you will pref=
er the many gorgeous parks, woods or the Donauinsel. There is a full kitc=
hen and washing machine, a wifi cube, two double beds plus 2 or 3 other s=
ofas and daybeds that can be used. It is really an artist space first and=
 makes no sense for anyone else. I will move my things out of the studio =
to an outside storage space so you will have plenty of room to work. I wi=
ll be stopping by Vienna a few times over the summer (I plan to stay with=
 friends) and can check in to see if you need anything.

Did you know that Vienna has a wine growing industry inside city limits? =
And a wildlife refuge, and a 24k long car free island in the Danube with =
one side of the river blocked creating a giant swimming (and in some part=
s nude) beach? You can use the guest bicycle and there is a great and alm=
ost free bike share program as well. I can help out with tips, things to =
do, shops for supplies and point you in the right direction for whatever =
you need for settling into the local scene or figuring out how to organiz=
e a visa (you would have to do this for a longer than 3 month stay if you=
 dont have an EU passport).

I will be in New York in the near future and could meet you in person if =
you would like to have more info. It is possible to agree on an equivalen=
t fixed US Dollar price to the 1400 Euro if that works better for you.

I would like a one-month deposit, which can be used for the last month. I=
 would make a discount only for paying all up front. I will pay the elect=
ric.

If you are interested, please tell me a little about yourself and how you=
 imagine you will use the space, and why you are interested to be in Vien=
na (as if it being such a beautiful city is not enough!).=20

$2,100.00 Per Month, Downtown, Brooklyn, 430 sq. ft., Quaint 1-bedroom fl=

Available: Mar 15, 2015

Hi, I&#39;m a choreographer/movement trainer who lives in a 3-family buil=
ding of friendly artists. I&#39;m currently seeking to rent the 3rd floor=
 walk-up apartment in this quaint antique brick building. It&#39;s 3 conn=
ected rooms plus a small side room that could be an office or storage roo=
m. It has lovely original molding, hard wood floors, tin ceilings and 6 w=
indows. It&#39;s a good kitchen for real cooking with a granite counterto=
p, and there&#39;s a washer/dryer included in the apartment. Heat, water =
and hot water are included.
We are convenient to many trains; Manhattan is 1 or 2 stops, or a short b=
ike ride over the Manhattan bridge one block away.=20
I believe that because of its set-up, this apartment works best for a sin=
gle person, maybe a very close couple, but not 2 roommates. No smoking is=
 allowed in the building, and no dogs, sorry. We can accommodate move-in =
dates from March 15 to April 1.

$2,000.00 Per Month, Park Slope, Gowanus, Carroll Gardens, Windsor Terrac=
e, Dumbo, Brooklyn, Looking for 2-bed apartment in Brooklyn
Available: Apr 01, 2015 through May 31, 2016

Hi!
I&#39;m looking for a 2-bed apartment in Brooklyn to move in by April 1st=
 or earlier. I&#39;ll be sharing it with a good friend but I want to sign=
 the lease because I&#39;ll be staying longer in NYC - at least a year.=20=


We&#39;re both girls in our late 20s who work and study in Manhattan, so =
we need a well-kept/recently renovated, quiet, 2-bedroom place in a good =
Brooklyn location with close access to the trains.=20

Ideally it&#39;ll have 2 bathrooms, but one is also fine. Nice common are=
as, good sized bedrooms, built-in closets, dryer and washer are a plus. W=
e like the areas near Park Slope/Gowanus, Windsor Terrace, Carroll Garden=
s-Cobble Hill-Boerum Hill, and Dumbo.
=20
I hold an F1 visa, work on campus, have a scholarship from my home countr=
y and this is my first year in the US as a graduate student, so I&#39;m l=
ooking for a landlord/owner willing to negotiate the credit check backgro=
und. Both me and my roommate are responsible, clean, laid-back, more into=
 reading, movie nights and homemade dinners. No party girls, but a glass =
of wine every once in a while suits us nicely!=20

Please email me know if you have or know of a place with the traits we&#3=
9;re looking for :)
