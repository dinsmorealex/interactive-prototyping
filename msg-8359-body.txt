$900.00 Per Month, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 800 sq. ft., Ground Floor Gall=
ery/Studio share available in Prime Williamsburg
Available: Dec 08, 2014

I just took over a gallery space that just moved out. Im turing it into a=
 studio to share with 2 other artists. I will be splitting the space into=
 3 separate work areas. The space has a huge storefront window and is on =
the ground floor on Montrose avenue and Lorimer, right off the J/M/L trai=
n in Williamsburg. Its a great sized studio that I want to double as a po=
p up gallery for the tenants and other guest artists. There is also a bac=
kyard that can be utilized (you just can&#39;t build anything crazy like =
a trojan horse back there).

All Utilities Included with Rent:=20
Heat / Air Conditioning / Ventilation,=20
Electricity,=20
Water,=20
Wi-Fi

I am looking for 3 month long commitments or longer. Flexible on arrangem=
ents

This location is in a prime spot just 10 minutes from getting into the ci=
ty. Great for studio visits that don&#39;t require your collectors travel=
ing hours to your place in Long Island

I have attached a few pictures. The gallery literally just moved out, so =
the place has not been cleaned yet. I also can send you a video of the sp=
ace to give you a better idea as to what it looks like. Visits are welcom=
e.

There are two opposing 17&#39; walls and a 12&#39; wall in the front sect=
ion.

$900 for 1 artist (2 spaces available)=20
or
$1500.00 if you want to just share the space with me and take the entire =
second 1/2

Please don&#39;t hesitate to ask any questions.

Thank you!

$500.00 Per Month, Prospect Heights/Crown Heights, Brooklyn, 80 sq. ft., =
Studio space in private home
Available: Nov 30, 2014

I am renting a studio space inside my private home. It is 10 x 8 feet and=
 includes a built in shelf and a window. My friend rented this space for =
a year to do her awesome knitting fashion, but needed a bigger space now.=
=20
She had her own space in the fridge and in the bathroom shelves.
The room is a subdivision from the living room and is made entirely of pl=
ywood.

I live here with my three year old son, who is with me Saturdays to Wedne=
sdays, but we are always gone from 8am to 6pm and this is the ideal time =
for the studio to be used. During the daytime you can spread out into the=
 kitchen and living room area, but please be sure to pack up in the eveni=
ng, as I have two cats and a three year old. All of whom a very curious c=
reatures (:
Please no arts that involve odor, paints, solvents or other hazardous thi=
ngs, as it is an open space and we will be sharing a living room.

r artists, of different backgrounds. I work elsewhere 3-4 days a week, an=
d am only in the studio weekends and a couple weekdays. The building is 1=
0 minutes walking from the Graham Ave. L and Grand St. L stations.

Some great things that are included are

- Fios High Speed Internet
- Slop Sinks
- Bathrooms
- Roof Access
- On-Street Parking
- Heating (metered and billed additionally)

I do photo and video work, so if you do something similar we can better s=
hare equipment and space. Otherwise, it is open to other medias as well. =
I have an available desk, if you are interested in using it.

If you have any questions or are interested in seeing it, please send me =
an email with what you do, and we can schedule a time to see it.

Thanks!

To anyone looking for a great new studio space to work in, I have been as=
ked to refer you to a new art studio project. I&#39;ve had my studio in t=
he same building for many years now, and it truly is a wonderful place to=
 work!=20

Because it&#39;s a brand new build out, there are many different spaces a=
vailable. The prices begin at $1025-$1350 for the medium-large ones. All =
have massive windows, and and are perfect size for sharing.

And then there are the truly enormous spaces with FAR more space and even=
 more windows. These range anywhere from $1400 - $4000.=20

Each space will have plenty of light and ventilation, as well as a heat a=
nd AC unit in every space. The building also provides gorgeous rooftop vi=
ews, 24 hour access and security, and an enormous loading dock and freigh=
t elevator.=20

For those not familiar with the area, it&#39;s generally thought of as a =
safe, quiet Brooklyn neighborhood. The building is just a few blocks from=
 the G train, with plenty of food options and easy street parking.

I have had my own art studio in this building for almost 4 years, and the=
 management has asked me to help get interest in the new spaces as they a=
re expanding the number of studios in the building. I will be the one sho=
wing the spaces and there are absolutely NO fees involved.

If you&#39;re interested, please text Jordan. I look forward to hearing f=
rom you. Thanks!

$650.00 Per Month, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 1000 sq. ft., Well equipped st=
udio, endless possibilities!
Available: Nov 27, 2014


This studio is well equipped with all kinds of tools and table space. To =
name a few of the tools, there is a bandsaw, miter saw, lathe, table saw,=
 3d printer, cnc cutter/plotter, welder, metal cut-off wheel, sewing mach=
ine, screen printing set up, and much more. There is a lot of good stores=
 around for art materials and hardware and I have a Bakfiet style cargo b=
icycle that you can use to pick things up. The other great thing about th=
e studio is it connects to a large backyard. The backyard has a couple wo=
rkstations and has lights and electrical sockets. I&#39;m also planning o=
n building a rock climbing wall out there this spring.=20

I&#39;m the only other person using the studio. I make artful design-work=
s that range from furniture concepts to toys. I also take jobs designing =
and making various kinds of handmade products. You can see my website at =
wastecog.com if you are interested. Lately I&#39;ve been doing more and m=
ore work outside of my studio and am out of town frequently so it makes s=
ense to find a studio mate. I&#39;m non-territorial and am open to moving=
 things around to make room for whatever my new studio mate needs to do. =
One thing that may be an issue for some is noise needs to be kept to a mi=
nimum after 11 pm. So no late-night power-tool parties.=20

The utilities are included in the price, and month to month is fine as lo=
ng as you can give a months notice before leaving.=20

Come by and see it!

$700.00 Per Month, Bushwick, Brooklyn, 360 sq. ft., Beautiful studio with=
 wall-of-windows, wonderful view, in great art studio building.
Available: Dec 01, 2014 through Jun 30, 2015

I will be using my studio very sparingly over the next 8 months or more -=
mostly just for storage, and I am seeking someone who would like to share=
 the space with me. There is also the possibility to stay on after 6 mont=
hs, when I am back in there more regularly, if we both decide that would =
work. The timeframe of the share has some flexibility as to when it begin=
s and ends, so if you have specific parameters, please let me know and I =
may be able to work with that. I am open to discussing the possibility of=
 a month to month sublet as well.=20
Most of my belongings will be stored behind a sliding wall, so they will =
be out of sight. I will retain one corner of the studio with a work table=
 and some power tools stored underneath it and may come in occasionally t=
o do some work, although it is unlikely.=20
Your portion would be 325sf of the 480sf.=20
Your portion of the rent is $700 plus utilities (which tend to be low.). =
You will have the place to yourself 99% of the time as I will be using it=
 primarily as a storage only.=20
The building has a 24 hr freight elevator and gated driveway for easy unl=
oading. The space has its own heater and thermostat and is completely pri=
vate and secure.
If we decide to share the space after 6 months, it will be divided evenly=
 and your rent will go down to reflect that.=20
Month to month lease options will be considered.
117 Grattan is a large studio building with mostly art studios and small =
businesses. The closest subway is the Morgan Ave L.=20
I am looking for someone who is responsible and courteous and who will be=
 respectful of the space.=20
No band practice inquiries please.=20
Also, please note, there is no internet here currently. I bring my mobile=
 hotspot when I come here to do work which requires internet connection. =
There is the possibility of getting getting internet for the studio.
Thanks,
Danielle

$770.00 Per Month, Bed Stuy, Brooklyn, 120 sq. ft., Room available in a 3=
-BR Bed Stuy apartment
Available: Dec 07, 2014

We have a room available starting December 7th, in a bright, airy, and ne=
at 3-BR apartment.
=20
The room: 10 x 12, closet, tall ceilings, hardwood floors, heater, and ne=
ighborhood view.
=20
The apartment: expansive, light, tastefully decorated, many plants, and w=
ell-organized. As a corner building, the space is flooded with natural li=
ght and cross breezes when the weather gets warm.  The building is well m=
aintained and we like to keep a good relationship with the property manag=
er who lives below.  We also pride ourselves in keeping the place clean (=
we do have a chart :)) and are respectful of all our common spaces.  The =
kitchen is fully equipped, minus dishwasher, and our laundromat is locate=
d across the street.
=20
The neighborhood: As much as Bed-Stuy is changing like so much of Brookly=
n, it retains a special neighborhood vibe and friendliness on the streets=
. There are little coffee shops, juice bars, and restaurants popping up h=
ere and there, but you can still get a dozen eggs for $1.99 at the bodega=
 on the corner.
=20
The roommates: We are two designers in our early thirties (Hanna-architec=
t and Lesley-event designer) who are also besties from grad school. Our v=
ersion of a house party is generally a sit-down meal with friends and we =
like to host fairly often. Otherwise, home is a calm, clean place to come=
 back to after some frequently grueling work hours. For both of us, bikin=
g is our main means of intra-Brooklyn transport (Lesley is also a cycling=
 enthusiast) and we are members of the Park Slope Food Coop. We would lik=
e to find another like-minded female to share our space and sign on to ou=
r lease.  Looking for someone who plans to stay at least a year.
=20
Details: $770/month plus utilities/wifi and a one-month security deposit

$1,200.00 Per Month, Jackson Heights, Queens, 200 sq. ft., Spacious Furni=
shed Room in Historic District, Jackson Heights
Available: Jan 03, 2015

Hello:)  I am looking for either a roommate or someone who wants to rent =
long term (a month or more) a spacious, sunny, fully furnished room in th=
e heart of Jackson Heights.  If you don&#39;t know about the neighborhood=
, Jackson Heights is a diverse, friendly, safe neighborhood, famous for i=
ts various foods and festivities.  I am in the Historic District where th=
e buildings are all preserved beautifully.    There are great grocery sto=
res near by and an array of trains (E,F,M,R,7), taking only 20 min to get=
 to mid town Manhattan.

The room I want to rent is as big as a NYC room gets (about 200 sq.ft.). =
 Its fully furnished with a king-sized bed, big desk, shelves, TV (with N=
etflix only) a good sized closet, as well as a coffee table and rocking c=
hair.  You will have your own fridge in the kitchen, and laundry machine =
in the house as well as in the basement.  It is very warm in the winter, =
and there is a ceiling fan and air conditioner for the summer. =20

I am looking for someone with a steady work schedule during the week day-=
-non-smoker, clean, reliable, and not a big party-person.  It would be pe=
rfect for someone with little (furniture) belongings.  Also suited for co=
uples, but that would only be for a short-term rental.=20

A little about me:  I am a musician artist, and work mostly at home.  I h=
ave a 7 year old son who is almost never home and goes to bed early with =
many activities out of the house.   Even if he is home, your room remains=
 totally private, and this factor would not restrict your lifestyle.  The=
 layout of the apartment allows you to come and go as you please, but of =
course, someone that likes children would be the best fit. =20

The rent includes utilities and Wi-Fi. =20

Please feel free to write me if you have any more questions:)

$1,650.00 Per Month, Park Slope, Brooklyn, Awesome Room in Renovated Park=
 Slope 2BR/1BA Apt.
Available: Dec 01, 2014 through Dec 01, 2015

I&#39;m about to close on a beautiful, renovated, airy, sunny, true 2 bed=
room, 1 bathroom apartment in the heart of Park Slope -- on 7th Avenue be=
tween Union Street and Berkeley Place.=20

The apartment has well-maintained hardwood floors, a dishwasher, washer a=
nd dryer in the unit, modern appliances, high ceilings and gets good ligh=
t. It has a wonderful, open feel to it with the common space opening righ=
t into the kitchen. Each bedroom has a closet with a storage unit above i=
t and both can easily fit queen size beds with room for dressers and/or d=
esks.=20

There are tons of great restaurants, shops and bars all around, and it is=
 around the corner from the Park Slope Food Co-op. Only two blocks walk t=
o Prospect Park and the weekend Grand Army Farmers Market.=20

The apartment is a 6 minute walk to the 2,3 &amp; B,Q trains and one stop=
 (or a 14 min walk) to Atlantic Terminal, and there is shared bike storag=
e on the first floor of the building.

The rent is $1650 + utilities. I&#39;m signing a 2-year lease starting De=

t-stabilized.

Living Style
I want the apartment to feel cozy and comfortable -- a nice, quiet, clean=
 place to come home to where we can easily relax. The apartment is unfurn=
ished, so I&#39;m happy to combine efforts in purchasing furniture/decora=
ting. I keep my living environment very clean -- shoes off, counter wiped=
, dishes done, no clutter, etc. I&#39;ve always lived with roommates and =
have easily gotten along with them. We don&#39;t need to be best friends,=
 but the living environment should be comfortable and open, and I&#39;d l=
ike to live with someone who would want to occasionally have dinner toget=
her, watch TV, chat, etc.

You
I&#39;m looking for someone male or female, 25-40, employed full-time, no=
n-smoker, no pets, no couples, *very* clean, into a healthy lifestyle and=
 into hobbies/enjoying all that NYC has to offer.=20

I&#39;m a 31-year old professional female working in communications for a=
 global non-profit. I travel occasionally for work. I&#39;m originally fr=
om NJ and recently moved back to the NYC area after living and working ov=
erseas for 3 years. My favorite hobbies include: yoga, traveling, cycling=
, scuba diving, jogging, hiking, live music and just about anything outdo=
ors.=20

If this sounds good to you, email me and we can meet up/I can show you th=
e apartment.

s hardwood floors, tall ceilings, stainless steal appliances, plenty of c=
abinet space, &amp; located off of Wilson Ave. The bedrooms are a great s=
ize and are on opposite ends of the apartment with the living room &amp; =
kitchen in between railroad style. Each bedroom is completely private wit=
h windows that let in some nice light. We have a clean, large, &amp; priv=
ate backyard! We are really looking forward to giving the yard some love =
&amp; making it a great place to relax &amp; have fun in. Hello summertim=
e bbq&#39;s!=20

Some nearby amenities include...
Maria Hernandez Park  two blocks=20
Associated Market  4 blocks=20
Molasses Books  1 block=20
24 hr laundromat - across the street=20
Velo Bike Shop  1 block=20
Bossa Nova  2 blocks=20
Lots of restaurants, cafe&#39;s, &amp; markets within a stone&#39;s throw=
!
The bedroom: Located in the front of the apartment. The rent for the room=
 is $1,100/month heat &amp; hot water are included &amp; additional utili=
ties to be split 3 ways. We prefer someone willing to stay long term. Eac=
h bedroom is on opposite ends of the apartment and spacious! Your room ha=
s a private entrance in addition to the main entrance of the apt by the k=
itchen. The current tenant may leave their lofted bed frame behind (they =
are still deciding). The room is spacious with a closet and space for a d=
esk and dresser without feeling claustrophobic. There are two windows tha=
t let in some nice light.

A little bit about ourselves: You would be living with my bf and myself a=
long with our dog and bunny; Clementine &amp; Anke. We are both hard work=
ing, pleasant, easy-going, &amp; creative twenty-something year olds who =
like coming home to a clean and comfortable place. My bf makes music (mos=
tly when home alone) &amp; I make photographs. We both have jobs in the c=
ity &amp; are away at work 35-40 hrs a week. We have always got on well w=
ith our previous roommates and prefer the friendly &amp; straightforward =
approach to any household issues as opposed to passive aggressiveness. We=
&#39;re looking for someone the same. In addition, we are always mindful =
of checking in with our roommate if we are planning to have people over t=
o hang out. The dog is the mellowest lab/border collie you&#39;ll ever me=
et. Her favorite things are eating, sleeping, cuddling &amp; stealing bun=
ny&#39;s carrots &amp; occasionally gets a spurt of energy where we play =
chase outside for 5 minutes then it&#39;s back to cuddling. My bf &amp; I=
 really enjoy music and sharing it with others without being pretentious =
about it. We try to catch live shows of our favorite bands and like going=
 out to dinner or drinks with friends but aren&#39;t ones for bringing a =
party home. We really enjoy traveling and taking road trips whenever poss=
ible. We are hoping to make it up to Canada in the Spring! We are both or=
iginally from California, &amp; made our cross country drive over to NYC =
this summer, after living in Portland, OR for four years, with whatever w=
e could fit in our Jeep. We enjoy a minimalistic but homey atmosphere. In=
 other words, we&#39;re not fan&#39;s of too much furniture or a lot of u=
nnecessary knick knacks or clutter in the apartment that make the place f=
eel cramped.=20
You: We are seeking a roommate who is similarly creative with an active s=
ocial &amp; work life outside of the apartment. A roommate who is clean, =
respectful, friendly, mature, self-aware, trustworthy, &amp; in their mid=
 20&#39;s to early 30&#39;s. We aren&#39;t asking to be best friends with=
 ya but we would like to share a home with someone who isn&#39;t awkward =
about socializing in the common space, watching a movie in the living roo=
m at the same time, or going out for a bite or drink every now &amp; then=
. We are totally fine with you having friends over from time to time as l=

ficant other we don&#39;t mind them staying over with you every now and t=
hen as long as they don&#39;t become the non-roommate roommate who overst=

$960.00 Per Month, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, 100 sq. ft., Beautiful Room in 2=
 Bedroom Railroad Available: 1/1/2015 through 8/31/2015
Available: Jan 01, 2015 through Aug 31, 2015

I&#39;m moving out of my room in this 2 BR in Greenpoint near McGolrick P=
ark. The apartment is a third floor walk-up and is railroad-style, with h=
igh ceilings, original moldings, built-in shelves, good plumbing and heat=
, working appliances and other amenities, including a roof with an amazin=
g eastern view of the city and a breezy fire escape; perfect for a solo b=
runch, weather permitting. The apartment is about 10 blocks from the G tr=
ain and a 20-minute walk to the L. The B48 bus stops across the street, a=
nd a B24 bus stop is one block away. There are several grocery stores, ca=
fes and laundromats within a couple of blocks. This is a nice little pock=
et of Greenpoint that&#39;s very relaxed, quiet and convenient.

The room is the middle in a railroad, and measures about 13x8 feet. There=
 are built-in drawers and shelves and a very large and deep closet. I fit=
 my full size bed, desk and bookshelves in here, and have room to walk ar=
ound.  There are no windows, but there&#39;s a glass panel above the door=
 between rooms and the room gets a decent amount of natural light. Rent i=
s $961.75 a month, and utilities (electric, gas, cable) average $60-70 a =
month. The security deposit is one month&#39;s rent. Would prefer someone=
 to stay at least through the end of this lease (which is up at the end o=
f August), although 3+ month subletters can work.

About my roommate: Guy, 27, Works in an office in Manhattan and runs a re=
cord label. No pets, but likes dogs and can tolerate a cat (cats have to =
be cleared with the landlord). Looking for someone who&#39;s responsible,=
 relaxed, able to pay rent and utilities on time, and reasonably clean. N=
on-smokers preferred. Has friends stay over about once a month, and is ac=
commodating if you have friends who want to stay over (within reason). If=
 you&#39;re interested, please email me and tell me a little about yourse=
lf.

$1,350.00 Per Month, East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Large, sunny room near =
Montrose L
Available: Dec 01, 2014

I&#39;m looking to rent the 2nd bedroom in my gorgeous, spacious, east Wi=
lliamsburg abode. It&#39;s a two-bedroom apartment off the Montrose L sto=
p (walking distance to JMZ and G as well). The room has large windows and=
 a large closet. The apartment has a large living room AND dining room AN=
D kitchen. I&#39;ve been here for 3.5 years with zero complaints, it&#39;=
s a lovely, charming apartment and I plan to stay as long as possible. It=
&#39;s above a quiet store. I love it here and you will too!

I&#39;m a 26 year old single girl, I work full-time as a literary/publish=
ing events planner, and I&#39;m a writer. I&#39;m very creative though my=
 extremely busy job keeps me away from the apartment a lot. You would hav=
e the place to yourself much of the time. I&#39;m quite clean and I like =
the apartment to stay that way, as well as quiet, though I am a very easy=
 going person and mostly just like to have calm and friendly roommates. W=
hen I am home I tend to cook, read, go running, watch movies on my laptop=
, and veg in my own space. My previous roommate moved here from home so m=
ost of the common area furniture is mine but I&#39;m totally up for rearr=
anging it if you&#39;ve got your own stuff too. Plenty of room!=20

It&#39;s a really great area and neighborhood, restaurants, bars, and caf=
e all within a block or two as well as many options. I love this location=
 especially because it&#39;s so easy to get to Bushwick, Williamsburg, an=
d Greenpoint, it&#39;s basically smack in the middle.

This room is December 1. We will split the internet and ConEd, about $100=
/month total, less in winter, more in summer. I&#39;ll be showing it pret=
ty consistently until it&#39;s scooped up. The current lease goes up unti=
l the end of March, up to you if you want to renew then.

We have one room available in a 3-bedroom apartment available immediately=
! The room is about 8x9.5 with two windows (one leading out to the fire e=
scape) and is located in the back corner of the apartment (super quiet). =
It doesn&#39;t have a closet, but has tons of wall space for shelving &am=
p; the last roommate made due with clothing racks. We have apple tv, a pr=
etty decent kitchen, &amp; an awesome living room to hang out in, particu=
larly during the day when it&#39;s drowning in natural sunlight.

The apartment is a second-floor walk-up in a three apartment building &am=
p; everyone is super nice/keeps to themselves. The neighborhood is quiet,=
 lots of working families, no college kids running amuck.=20

We are two southern ladies (mid twenties from new orleans &amp; early thi=

 to get along with. S is a freelance videographer, editor, &amp; producer=
. H is a printmaker with a studio in Gowanus. We&#39;re pretty chill all =
around, but like to put an emphasis on keeping public spaces clean, since=
 messes can pile up quickly. No dishes in the sink for more than a day, c=
lean your hair out of the drains, help with the sweeping/scrubbing when n=
ecessary. Pretty basic stuff.

About You:
Personable, employed, and respectful of community spaces. No smoking indo=
ors, no pets, &amp; brownie points if you have Chase Quickpay (makes payi=
ng bills 1000000x easier). We&#39;d like to have someone stay until the e=
nd of the lease in September, but we&#39;re also open to shorter stays.

We&#39;ll be showing the apartment every night after 7pm until the first =

ected space, and the 2 bedrooms are on opposite ends of the apartment, wh=
ich offers nice privacy for roommates. The bedroom faces a park in the ba=
ck and is cozy with a large window with trees filtering a lot of the ligh=
t. This bedroom could come with a full size bed if you would like, but it=
 easy to remove if you want a blank slate.  The room faces opposite of th=
e street so it feels nice and tucked away. It is fully equipped with WiFi=
. I have one full bathroom, with a tub and a shower, clean and white! All=
 the things you might need in a full kitchen right next to a great little=
 eating nook. The living room is equipped with a daybed with two large wi=
ndows.  This room is very comfortable and easy to relax in.  There is a s=
helf but no closet in the bedroom, but the closet in the living room is e=
ntirely yours.

I am a 36 year old female restaurant manager.  I work a lot of hours most=
ly at night.  I am very tidy but love to relax at home, and am frequently=
 out and about.  I am not a late crazy partier, but I will have a friend =
or two over for dinner and drinks here and there.  I would love someone I=
 could talk to and even occasionally share a drink, but is independent an=
d into their own things.  Over all I am down to earth, easy going, try to=
 be funny...and Enjoy others.

location:=20
I love being in Williamsburg so close to such lively and interesting shop=
s and restaurants on Bedford, Wythe, Berry and Havermeyer streets. From h=
ere great coffee shops, restaurants,and boutiques, are steps away. Despit=
e the close proximity to all of these things, my street is just quiet eno=
ugh for a reprieve if you need a little oasis away from the action,.  It =
is on the south side (S. 4th in between Berry and Bedford) of Williamsbur=
g but north of Broadway.  It is just a mere 8 minute walk to the &quot;L&=
quot; and&quot;JMZ&quot; trains, both only one stop away from Manhattan. =
My landlord lives in the building for a very convivial and safe feel.

$1,550.00 Per Month, East Village, New York, Fully furnished bedroom in a=
 charming pre war apartment
Available: Dec 01, 2014

I&#39;m looking for one person to sublet the second room in my sunny, two=
 bedroom, East Village apartment on December 1--it&#39;s perfect for some=
one new to New York who doesn&#39;t want to go through the hassle of furn=
ishing their apartment and jumping through all of the new tenant hoops.=20=


The room is well laid out by East Village standards. It comes fully furni=
shed with a standard sized bed (with all of the pillows, sheets, and blan=
kets) a desk and chair, and a large wall shelving unit. It also has a clo=
set with ample storage space. The room has one window which looks onto an=
 interior courtyard, with a partial view of Tompkins Square Park.

The shared space is roomy for its size, and includes an open living/dinin=
g room, a full kitchen, all connected by a delightful little breakfast no=
ok. The kitchen is fully decked out with an assortment of pots, pans, and=
 kitchenware that you&#39;d be welcome to use. The sofa is nice and comfy=
, and pulls out into a full sized bed for when you have guests in town.=20=


The apartment itself is across the street from Tompkins Square Park, and =
steps from a huge selection of laundromats, bodegas, bars, gallery spaces=
, restaurants, grocery stores, boutique stores, a farmers market (on Sund=
ays), and all that the East Village has to offer. The skyline image, by t=
he way, is from the actual rooftop.=20

The rent is $1550 a month, plus utilities and Internet. You&#39;re sublet=
ting from me, so there&#39;s no broker fee or credit check. To move in, I=
 also require a $1000 deposit that will be returned to you on move out.

A bit about me: I am a 30 year old male public school teacher. I am out o=
ften, relatively quiet in the apartment, and rarely entertain multiple pe=
ople in the space. I&#39;m looking for someone who is clean, respectful o=
f the space, and generally easygoing.

$1,200.00 Per Month, Prospect Lefferts Gardens, Brooklyn, One Bedroom one=
 bathroom available in a three bedroom apt
Available: Dec 01, 2014 through May 31, 2015

Hello there! My roommate and I are currently searching for a new roommate=
 to fill the third bedroom and second bathroom in our apartment. We are i=
deally looking for someone who can finish out the lease with us on May 31=
 (with the option of possibly staying on beyond if it&#39;s the right fit=
) but there is flexibility on the move-in date. You can move in any time =
between December 1 and 31. Your room has two big western facing windows a=
nd a full size closet. The room is 9&#39;8&quot;x14&#39;3&quot; so it can=
 accommodate a big bed, a dresser, and desk. It comes with an almost new =
window unit air conditioner. There is exposed brick along one wall.

The apartment was renovated a year and a half ago so it has nice new wood=
 floors, new appliances in the kitchen, including a full sized dishwasher=
. There is also laundry in the basement. We are close by to grocery store=
s and coffee shops. Prospect Park is about a ten minute walk away and we =
are near to the entrance to the new skating rink as well as the Botanic G=
arden. We like to shop at the Grand Army Plaza farmer&#39;s market on Sat=
urdays and drop off our compost there as well.=20

About us: we are two women in our mid 20s. My roommate works in an office=
 9-6 on weekdays. I have a hectic schedule as an actor so the two of us u=
nfortunately don&#39;t overlap at home too often. This makes for a pretty=
 quiet and cozy apartment life. When we are home together, we like to wat=
ch movies and make delicious (mostly vegetarian) dinners and are looking =
for someone who wants a similar low-key home life. If this sounds like so=
mething you&#39;re interested in, please reach out to us!

$2,800.00 Per Month, Red Hook, Brooklyn, 1200 sq. ft., Luminous Open Loft=
 Space in Historical Factory Building
Available: Jan 06, 2015 through Jan 06, 2016

Open, 1200 sq.ft. loft space with 14&#39; ceilings and constant beautiful=
 light from seven 8ft tall windows with views of both  Manhattan and down=
town Brooklyn skylines. The building is located right on Coffey Park in t=
he center of Red Hook, just a couple blocks from Van Brunt St. and all ou=
r great bars, shops, restaurants and bus lines. The G an F subway lines a=
re a 15 min. walk into Carroll Gardens, or a shorter but more harrowing w=
alk across Hamilton Ave. to Smith &amp; 9th. There is also the Ferry Serv=
ice to Wall St. with stops at both the Ikea &amp; Fairway docks. Street p=
arking is fairly easy around the building if you have a car. Bicycles may=
 be parked in the courtyard.

Laundries are located on each of the four floors, as are garbage and recy=
cling stations. The loft has a full bathroom with a claw foot tub. there =
is a fully equipped kitchen at one end of the space with a large round di=
ning table and long wooden prep table. There is a single, Sleigh Day Bed,=
 swivel office chair and drafting chair and a window seat. There is also =
a Bose CD/mp3 player amp and DVD player, WiFi and AC. Heating is independ=
ent with thermostat. There is a 6 ft x 42&quot; drawing table and a 14&#3=
9; x 11&#39; working wall for large drawings.

This loft is organized for one person,( although couples have been happy =
here ), as there is no divided space, no roommate arrangements will be co=
nsidered. But there is really nothing like one great big room all to your=
self.

Also, whereas this is the perfect place to draw or work on small models, =
I am sorry that I cannot allow painting or sculpting or power tools.

There are no fees, I ask only a security deposit and first and last month=
&#39;s rent before taking occupancy.

I will be showing the space myself. I have a sublease contract that I ame=
nd , if needed, with the tenant. I must meet anyone personally who will l=
ive in my space and I may ask for a recommendation. I give tenants contac=
t information to the building management and provide tenants with contact=
s for them as well as our wonderful super in case there is any need of im=
mediate assistance.

$1,000.00 Per Month, ridgewood/bushwick, new york, 2 Rooms in Very Large =
Renovated Industrial Space in Ridgewood/Bushwick
Available: Dec 01, 2014 through Apr 30, 2015

We lease a very large space that used to be a factory (living/dining room=
 are 55x26x11) and have 2 rooms available December 1st and January 1st (o=
r possibly sooner): 10x9x11 lofted room with big window and bed included =
if needed (Dec,) and a 12x11x11 lofted room with 2 very large windows (Ja=
n.) The whole house gets tons of sunlight with 4 windows and a skylight i=
n the common areas as well.  We are in Ridgewood just across the border f=
rom Bushwick.

The 10x9x11 room is avail Dec 1st (possibly before) for 3 months.

The 12x11x11 room is avail Jan 1st for 4 months.

Ideally, we&#39;re looking for someone who can appreciate the massive spa=
ce and put it to use. It&#39;s an event space, so you could have an art o=
pening, teach a class, have a performance art type show, movie screening,=
 photography/film shoot, etc. We are currently under construction downsta=
irs building a recording studio.

The space is large and gets dirty quickly.  You need to be pro-active abo=
ut cleaning so that we can all enjoy the space that we share.  If we all =
do a little bit more than we think is expected well all be happy.

One thing to note: The massive space does not get especially warm in the =
harsh winter months. We have only 2 radiators in the communal area which =
does not retain heat very well at all. Expect to wear layers and sweaters=
. The bedrooms each have a radiator and we&#39;ll provide a supplemental =
electric heater if needed.

About us:

Roommates #1 &amp; #2 (couple) live downstairs and are constructing the s=
tudio. We both work in film (in the field mixing and booming, in the stud=
io post-production) and we play in our duo band (whatpreytell.bandcamp.co=
m) We&#39;re young at 26 &amp; 29, ambitious, drink sometimes, smoke some=
times, and like to throw a show out of the event space in the winter time=
. We practice about twice to 5 times a month and only during the day time=
 hours so it doesn&#39;t disturb anyone&#39;s slumber. We are fun, easy-g=
oing and very busy!

Roommate #3 is a sound guy. He works a lot, but you&#39;ll see him in the=
 afternoons. He&#39;s a cheeky sort of chap, a little older (something li=
ke 35) but young at heart. Very very fun to be around when he&#39;s had a=
 few. Loves to play chess. A good guy.

Roommates #4 &amp; #5 are a friendly couple. She&#39;s a bartender/waitre=
ss who likes to hoola hoop and he manages the seafood station at whole fo=
ods. I don&#39;t see them but once a week on average and usually late at =
night after they get off work.

Roommate #6 works a lot but is very knowledgeable in technology and compu=
ters. He&#39;s also a dj by night. Fun great awesome guy.

Roommate#7 works 2 jobs and goes to school so we hardly ever see her.  Sh=
e goes to school for fashion.

We all love to play vinyls. Sometimes we put a movie on the projector at =
night. We all do our part to keep the communal spaces neat and clean. Bug=
s and rodents are a non-issue. We have 1.5 bathrooms. We smoke our cigs o=
utside. The vibe here is free &amp; chill, and we hope to maintain that. =
 It isn&#39;t a party house by any stretch- it is a home, but we have our=
 friends over sometimes and it can get a little loud.  We all try our bes=
t to be respectful and communicative about our needs.  All I really mean =
is, if the record is playing too loudly or voices are up, just say so!  W=
e appreciate communication.=20

No furry pets- allergies!

We&#39;re a 3 block walk from the L train stop Dekalb stop-- Post office,=
 shops, supermarket, dollar stores, beer distributors, &amp; laundromats =
are all within short walking distance! The M train is a short 9 blocks aw=
ay as well as the B38 bus around the corner takes you to downtown Brookly=
n in 20 mins!  If you have a bicycle, we have plenty of space for you to =
park it inside.

First month, last month rent, and deposit are required to move in. That&#=
39;s $3,000.  A great deal for someone who has an appreciation and use fo=
r so much communal event space.  Again, the rooms can be furnished with b=
eds as well as shelving and anything else you might need.  Just ask!  The=
 rent does not include utilities, which runs about $70-$90 per person.

Available: Jan 01, 2015 through Jul 31, 2015

I&#39;m looking for someone to take over my lease of a lovely East Villag=
e studio with a balcony starting January 1st. Lease ends July 31st with t=
he option to renew as long as youre in good standing.=20
Conveniently located on 11th St near 1st Ave, a 10 minute walk from Union=
 Square and a 7 minute walk to the Astor 6. There&#39;s a great little co=
ffee shop right downstairs and I love to get pastries at Veniero&#39;s, o=
nly two doors down.
This walk-up has a balcony with a beautiful sky view.=20
Updated bath and kitchen, with a dishwasher. Pets are allowed and guarant=
ors are accepted. You would completely take over my lease through the man=
agement company. I will be happy to help you with the easy process.=20
The pictures are from the actual apartment, with two different layouts (m=
ine and the tenant before me). I&#39;ve spoken to the management company,=
 and they allow lease assignments. I will pay a lease termination fee and=
 someone will sign on for the remainder of my lease (which ends July 31st=
). The new lessee will pay no broker fee (I&#39;m renting the apartment, =
I&#39;m not a broker). The next tenant will have to submit a normal appli=
cation to Westminster (which I believe costs $100, maybe less, but no mor=
e). The application includes a copy of a photo ID, two last bank statemen=
ts, most recent tax returns, and last two pay stubs (the &quot;normal stu=
ff&quot; for a renter&#39;s application). There is a refundable deposit i=
f someone would like to have a dog here, but a cat requires no deposit. I=
 will be showing the apartment myself. I will coordinate with anyone inte=
rested to find a time that works for both of our schedules.=20

or need to work from home. The actual bedroom is huge and has lots of won=
derful light, closet space, and a queen-size bed. The kitchen is also hug=

ntertain. The whole apartment is fully furnished and thus I will need som=
eone responsible to look after my things and feed my little plants.=20

The building is *very* clean with a super on site -- in case you need any=
thing. Angel, the super, is very kind and will take care of it right away=

 cafes (one just opened next door), and some very nice bars. There is a b=
ookstore on Flushing ave. about 7 minutes from the house and great restau=
rants throughout. There are plenty of good grocery stores around. For tra=
nsportation you have two options, either the j/m/z trains two blocks away=
 (these will have you in Manhattan in 20 minutes, max) or the L train abo=
ut 3 blocks away (20 minutes to Manhattan).=20

Utilities are not included, and run about $100 - 120 month. These include=
 cooking gas, electricity, and internet (heat is covered by the landlord)=
. I&#39;ve got a Wii hooked up to the flat screen in the living room so y=
ou can enjoy all of the Netflix your little heart desires. Sorry, no pets=
 -- landlord&#39;s rule, not mine! (Not negotiable)

Please do specify if you can take the apartment for the entire four month=
s. I will need the the first month&#39;s rent plus a $1,700 security depo=
sit to give you the keys (so $3,400 total). The security deposit is fully=
 refundable (given there are no damages to the apartment). Feel free to e=
mail me with questions -- I am looking to secure a sublease as soon as po=
ssible, so if you are in the city and can take a look at the apartment, I=
 am game!
