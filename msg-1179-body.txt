Hello List-

Listings Project Story of the Week:

Hi Stephanie,
I've been waiting to tell my listing story. August 2010, I was returning to=
 the=20
city from summer break with the goals of finding a shop and finding true lo=
ve. I
 gave a friend a ride back to New York and on the way she said she would fo=
rward
 me the listings project. Next month I found a 3 car garage in Williamsburg=
 and=20
went to go see it. I ended up renting it, building a soundproof masonry ban=
d rock
room inside it, building robot drummers in the shop outside it, and dating =
the girl
who rented me the room. Now I live with her next to the shop and we are ver=
y happy
together. My robots won 6 blue ribbons at Maker Faire at the hall of scienc=
e. I=20
am almost finished recording a full length album in the studio, IT IS ALL R=
EALLY
 AWESOME!
Thanks for your help in this you big angel you!
Tim

The loft is located on the 2nd floor of an industrial building housing  oth=
er creative
types and musicians. You would be living with 5 other  roommates in their e=
arly=20
20's-everyone has their own individual private  rooms built out. We have la=
rge common
areas and there is one bathroom, a  full kitchen, project space, living roo=
m area,
and a second platform  that we are converting to a dining area. We have a w=
all of
windows,  super high ceilings in common areas, and a skylight-not the brigh=
test=20
 but helps kick the winter blues.
The rent is $600 month ALL utilities, internet, and house needs  included-d=
own to
dish soap and toilet paper. That being said we are  looking for a fellow cr=
eative
not just looking for cheap rent. Move-in  is $1200 total (first month's ren=
t and
 deposit). Rent is month-to-month,  with a month's notice upon moving out. =
We'd=20
prefer someone looking to  stay at least 4-6 months minimum, but can sublet=
 to the
right person.  Move-in would be JAN 1st, but can likely be possible a few d=
ays early
 due to New Years! The room available is approx. 8x14, no window but  large=
 space.
What we ARE looking for:
-We keep an all vegetarian kitchen and prefer another vegetarian-if  you're=
 a meat
eater that's cool, just dine out when you're craving a  steak :)
-Someone queer/queer friendly as 3 of us identify that way
-Someone motivated and down to utilize the space
-Friendly and down to earth, we're not looking for a best bud but we defini=
tely=20
all get along
-Carpentry skills would be a bonus, any skill you could add to the house wo=
uld be
warmly welcomed.
-Must be willing to take part in house chores, with 6 people living  under =
one roof
it's a necessary evil. We're not clean freaks but follow a  simple chore wh=
eel.
What we are NOT looking for:
-No hard drugs/heavy drinkers/ragers
-Someone who brings the party home (we all have busy work schedules and res=
pect=20
each other's needs for sleep)
-Someone who works from home
-Someone late with rent-it's due on the 1st of every month with no exceptio=
ns.
If it sounds like a good fit, please send us a bit about yourself along  wi=
th your
availability the view the space. If you have any work online  send us a lin=
k-we'd
love to see it!
Thanks!

$380.00 per week, West Midtown Manhattan, Large railroad apartment, Looking=
 for=20
a roommate to share
Available: Jan. 8, 2012 through April 15, 2012
Hi,
I am looking for a roommate starting Jan. 8-April 15 with the possibility t=
o extend.
I live in a large railroad apartment in West Midtown Manhattan.  This  area=
 is convenient,
safe and happening.  I have lived here for 15 years.   I am looking for a p=
erson
 who is responsible with a job and able to  pay upfront for the 3 plus mont=
hs with
a money order or cashier's check.   If you are a student/intern, I ask for =
the same,
to be able to pay for  the 3 plus months with a money order or cashier's ch=
eck.=20
 I don't mind  uploading pic's, but pictures do not show how spacious the a=
partment
is,  so if you're in the area, I  invite you to come see the place vs pic's=
.
I am looking for someone who is easy going, please no drama or petty  issue=
s.  A
 non-smoker and who loves cats.  I have one adorable cat.
The total rent for 14 weeks includes the large, front room in a  furnished =
, railroad
apartment, internet, cable and all utilities.  I  will be out of town for o=
ne month
from Feb-March, so you will also have  the apartment to yourself during tha=
t time.
 I will be taking my cat,  but if you are a cat lover and a trustworthy cat=
 caregiver,
I will take a  percentage off the fee if we  both agree that you will take =
care=20
of my  cat while I am gone.  (TBD)
Please have two references, (past landlord/employer)
Also, I do ask that we both sign a written agreement between the two of  us=
, confirming
what we've discussed and agreed on.  This gives an  informal protection for=
 both
 parties.  Not un-common in NYC.
Thanks and Happy 2012!!

$1000 per month, Carroll Gardens, 8x16, bright, colorful artist apartment c=
lose=20
to everything.
Available: February 1
I live in a three-bedroom apartment in Carroll Gardens. It's rent  stabiliz=
ed, so
it's still affordable enough to share with one other  person. This means th=
at your
half of the apartment includes not only a  private bedroom, way on the othe=
r side
of the apartment from me, but  also half of an extra room, which is good fo=
r storage,
house guests, and  office space.
The apartment is on a pretty, tree-lined street a block and a half away  fr=
om the
F and G at Carroll. It has wood floors, bright colors on the  walls, breeze=
s in=20
the summer, and free heat in the winter. There's a  nice cooking kitchen wi=
th lots
of space to work. Your room is medium  size, about 8x16, and has two window=
s. Utilities
are about $75 per  month, which includes cable internet wifi, netflix, and =
renter's
 insurance.
I've been here for 10 years, and I've had three roommates in that time.  Th=
is is
 a good apartment. I'm in my late 30s, and I act like a grown-up  most of t=
he time.
I work honest jobs at weird hours, so that means I'm  sometimes gone at nig=
ht, or
sleep during the day. I'm neat, but not  overbearing, and I'm fair to a fau=
lt. I'm
vegetarian, I ride a bike  every day, I like house guests, and I have a gir=
lfriend.
Sometimes I  like to sublet my room, and you are encouraged to do that as w=
ell if
you  travel. I don't smoke, drink, or do drugs, but I dont care if you do.
I have a strong preference toward creative people with full time jobs  and =
busy=20
social lives. You're, you know, awesome. This room is not a  sublet. It's u=
p for
 long-term rent with a 6-month try out period. I need  one-month's deposit =
when=20
you sign a rental agreement, and your first  month when you move in. Please=
 send

$1150 per month, Greenpoint, 1800 sq ft, Room available in gorgeous loft wi=
th roof
deck - city view
Available: 2/1/2012
My roommate and I are looking for someone to share our beautiful and very s=
pacious
loft in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.
There is currently 1 room available - a lofted bedroom, with plenty of  hea=
droom
 - about 9' ceilings. It is partially open on one side and  overlooks the c=
ommon
 space. I think the room measures 12'x16'. I live in  the space currently a=
nd there
is plenty of room for my queen sized bed  and furniture.
The loft apartment itself is very big... over 1800 sq feet - with 20'  ceil=
ings.
 There are over-sized windows on 3 of the 4 sides, and 7  windows on the ba=
ck wall,
providing a postcard worthy skyline view of  the city across the East River=
. The
 view is even better from our large  roof deck which features a grill and l=
arge=20
dining area.
The loft gets a lot of light, and the street is very quiet with ample  park=
ing out
front. There are 2 living areas, a dining area, a large  kitchen area with =
all of
the basics and a decent sized bathroom with a  view of the Empire State bui=
lding.
There is a washer and dryer in the  space and wi-fi. We are about 6 blocks =
from=20
the G line, and a short walk  to the 7 (one stop and you are at Grand Centr=
al).=20
The B43 and B62 bus  lines are also very close.
The loft is at the northernmost part of Greenpoint, which is a very  charmi=
ng, safe,
and rapidly developing area. There are many great  restaurants, bars, coffe=
ehouses,
boutiques, grocery stores... all within  easy walking distance.
Us: There are three roommates but only two of us live in the loft. Our  thi=
rd roommate,
Rachel, rents a portion of the space to use as her art  studio. She is an a=
rtist
 with an MFA from NYU, with a day job working  with an artist in Manhattan.=
 The=20
two live-ins are Cassidy - a sound guy  and me, Angela - an accountant with=
 a day
job in LIC. There is also  Jacques, my cat. We are in our early 30s/40s, af=
fable
 and laid back, and  are looking to find another roommate with a compatible=
 lifestyle
to  share our loft.
You should be respectful, responsible, quiet enough, tidy, reasonably  matu=
re, fond
of cats, have steady income and be looking to stay for  awhile. Another cat=

Available: Now through 1 yr/ 2yr
You want a space to create in that will be clean, quiet and homey. You  lik=
e you're
autonomy but aren't misanthropic. You're okay with a little  dog hanging ar=
ound.
 You have a design aesthetic and want to have say in  how the place looks, =
feels
 and what-not. You like salvaged wood shelves,  DWR and green household cle=
aners.
You don't smoke. You're more a book  reader, online watcher than a big scre=

 devotee. You love your  friends, your life, but want to keep the home fron=
t low-key.

everything.
The amount of  private space you get to have all to yourself is over 300 sq=
. ft.
This is the perfect share for a mature writer, designer, creative person  n=
eeding
to make work at home. I will be writing and making 2D works in  my space, k=
eeping
the guests to a minimum, and away most evenings for  work.
The loft building is a former Chocolate Factory located in a quiet  neighbo=
rhood
 with Steiner Studios in the old Navy Yard on one side and  Fort Greene/ Cl=
inton
 Hill on the other. Fort Greene Park and Flea, Pratt  and trains are all in=
 walking
distance. The building is non-partying  with creative professionals, famili=

APARTMENTS FOR SUBLET

$1250 per month plus 150 utilities, Williamsburg, 2 bedroom furnished apart=
ment
Available: March 1st
Hello list,
I am looking for a "roommate"in my 2 bedroom furnished apt while I am in gr=
ad school
on the west coast (2.5 years).
Move in date is March 1st, 2011. You would have use of the largest bedroom.
The rent is 150 for all utilities & wireless and 1250 for rent. I would pay=
 20$=20
a night toward the rent (my room is much smaller) when I would stay there w=
hich=20
would go against the 1400 a month rent,
but I don't expect to be there that often since.
The place is best for someone with no furniture and not too much stuff, but=
 there
is storage and the bedroom is large.  I can only allow one roommate, sorry,=
 no couples.
Address: south 3rd and keap, Brooklyn, NY 11211
I have lived here for 6 years and LOVE the building, neighborhood, and *its=
 convenient*
to Manhattan (15 min door to Union Square).  Its a 5th floor walk-up.
I'm looking for someone clean and responsible with rent, and who will be di=
screte
in the building. The landlord can be noisy, but he isn't that bad.  I am al=
lowed
 to have a roommate.

$150.00 per day, Greenpoint, Really beautiful modern studio apartment with =
loft=20
space:)
Available: January through February
Hi there~
As I am away so much of the months I thought I would offer my  awesome stud=
io apartment.
I've broken it down to daily payments, but  weekly and even monthly stays a=
ren't
 out of the question at all. The  building is brand new, all new amenities,=
 laundry
on each floor.  Apartment is 1st floor with  a private terrace. G train is =
steps
 away  and Williamsburg is walking distance. Honestly getting into downtown=
  Manhattan
takes about 40 minutes even though it's very close, because of  the train l=
ayout.
I usually use a very reliable car service nearby.  $20.00 into downtown Man=
hattan.
More than plenty to do in the  neighborhood which i'll have posted on the r=
efrigerator.
I'm a  dancer/choreographer/yoga instructor myself. Because I travel as oft=
en  as
I do it would be most awesome to find someone looking for a place in  NY mo=
nthly.
Please write me back the dates you are looking for and some  details about =
yourself
and your goings on. Look forward to hearing from  you!

$1700 per month, East Village, 300 sq ft, Sunny Single Bedroom Apartment in=
 the=20
East Village
Available: February 1 through April 31st
I am subletting my darling single bedroom apartment in the East Village.   =
The building
is on a very charming street with coffee shops,  restaurants, vintage shops=
 and=20
very close access to Tompkins Square  Park.  It is a quick walk to all the =
treasures
of the lower east side-  the community gardens, Union Square Farmers Market=
, New
 Museum, Sunshine  Cinema, etc.
The apartment is a four-story walk up, it will keep you in good shape!   It=
 is very
sunny and the building is quiet - full of working adults.   There are three=
 separate
rooms in the apartment: a bedroom, a kitchen  and a living room.  The bathr=
oom is
the only 'catch' - the shower is in  the kitchen (which is so fun!) and the=
 toilet
is in a private, locked  little water closet across the hall - for the excl=
usive
 use of whomever  occupies my apartment.  In my experience, the positive qu=
alities
of the  apartment (location, sunlight, convenience, quirkiness) have far  o=
ut-shined
the bathroom issue.
I am only moving out to save some money for graduate school, I love this  a=
partment
and I hope to find someone who will love it as well.  I'm  looking to find =
someone
to start renting on Feb 1st until the lease ends  on April 31st, however ar=
rangements
can also be made to rent the  apartment on a weekly basis, which would be $=
500 a
 week.

SEEKING APARTMENTS AND ROOMS

$1000 per month, Seeking furnished room for sublet in Brooklyn near subway
Available: January 2012 through December 2012
I am a 28 year old filmmaker and photographer seeking a furnished room  for=
 sublet
from December 2011 through to November 2012. I'm most  interested in the we=
st side
of Brooklyn, and easy access to a subway  line is essential. I'm also inter=
ested
 in Manhattan if you can  accommodate my budget of around $1000 per month, =
depending
on the  location and room. It is preferable to me that the room is already =
 furnished
with a bed and desk, although not essential for a longer term  lease.
I'm interested in living with other young creative people who like to be  s=
ocial,
but not be crazy all week as I'm fairly dedicated to my film  and photograp=
hy work.
I have a quiet and clean homelife. I don't smoke  or have pets. I'm easy go=
ing to
live with, I'll get along with anyone.  The only thing I don't like is smok=
ing inside.
I'm often out working or  seeing friends, but don't bring the party home. I=
 occasionally
like to  cook, although because I am out so much I'm more likely to eat out=
 of =20
the house.

ARTIST STAY March 20-30 with possibility of swap in Moscow
Available: March 20-30
Hello I am writing on behalf of  Irina Korina, the highly respected
Moscow-based installation artist who is looking for NYC accommodation
for about a week starting on March 21st.
Irina is here for her debut solo exhibition in America, which opens on
Sunday March 25th at the Scaramouche Gallery on Orchard St.
More about Irina's "total installation" work can be viewed at:
http://www.russian-pavilion.info/eng/Korina.html.
A great opportunity to learn about the contemporary Russian art scene
from a central figure whose work transcends cultural borders.
I am a curator of this project.
A limited exhibition budget necessitates low or no cost accommodation
with an offer of a Moscow sojourn in exchange.

OPPORTUNITIES

Open Call, New York, Applications are open for The Work Office (TWO)
Date: Deadline January 24, 2012
The Work Office (TWO) is now hiring, in partnership with the Bronx River Ar=
t Center!
As part of the "Shifting Communities" exhibition series at the Bronx  River=
 Art=20
Center (BRAC) gallery, TWO is hiring artists to create and  present assignm=
ents=20
with a focus on the Bronx, NY. Applications for TWO  employment are being a=
ccepted
through January 24, 2012. Visit  www.theworkoffice.com or BRAC to apply.
The Work Office (TWO) is a multidisciplinary art project disguised as an  e=
mployment
agency. Informed by the Works Progress Administration (WPA)  of the Great D=
epression
in the 1930s, TWO is a gesture to "make work"  for visual and performing ar=
tists,
writers, and others by giving them  simple, idea-based assignments that exp=
lore,
 document, and improve daily  life in New York City. From a temporary, publ=
icly=20
accessible office  installed at BRAC, TWO's administrators will hire employ=
ees,=20
exhibit  work, and distribute Depression-era wages at a Payday Party on Feb=
ruary
  10.
TWO is accepting applications for assignments that can be presented at  BRA=
C's gallery.
The proposals should explore the relationship between  art and civic life a=
nd respond
to the unique history and/or nature of  the Bronx through one of the follow=
ing TWO
assignments:
-build a bridge
-reinterpret a newspaper photo
-record an oral history with someone who lives or works in the Bronx
-design a poster to promote something
-make a mixed CD related to places, people, or experiences in the Bronx
-catalog WPA structures in NY
-document a need for repairs
-give a concert for a plant
-make a regional travel guide for a place, neighborhood, or phenomenon in t=
he Bronx
-start an American tradition
-assign yourself
Applications and instructions are available on TWO's  website-www.theworkof=
fice.com-and
at BRAC's gallery. A TWO administrator  will contact and interview applicat=
ions=20
of interest by January 26.  Interviews will take place on January 27 and 28=
. Applications
are  evaluated based on the strength and clarity of the proposed response t=
o  one
of our assignments, its relationship to the Bronx, and the  practicality of=
 realizing
it within a week.
Hired employees must be able to complete their assignments during the  work=
week=20
of February 2-8, drop off work at the BRAC gallery on February  9, and atte=
nd a=20
public Payday Party on the evening of Friday, February  10. At the Payday P=
arty,
 artist/employees will collect their workweek  wage of $23.50 for their com=
pleted
assignment, the same weekly wage that  artists received in the Federal One =
Project
(the arts division of the  WPA). The public will be invited to view the wee=
k's works
and learn  about the project. Completed assignments will be publicly exhibi=
ted at
 BRAC's gallery throughout the week of February 11-18 and on TWO's  website=
.
Applications must be submitted by 11:59 PM, January 24.

 August 2010, I was returning to the city from summer break with the goals =
of finding a shop and finding true love. I gave a friend a ride back to New=
 York and on the way she said she would forward me the listings project. Ne=
xt month I found a 3 car garage in Williamsburg and went to go see it. I en=
ded up renting it, building a soundproof masonry band rock room inside it, =
building robot drummers in the shop outside it, and dating the girl who ren=
ted me the room. Now I live with her next to the shop and we are very happy=
 together. My robots won 6 blue ribbons at Maker Faire at the hall of scien=
ce. I am almost finished recording a full length album in the studio, IT IS=
 ALL REALLY AWESOME!</span><br /></div><div><span style=3D"font-family: Tah=

1st for our amazing true  industrial loft space off Jefferson L . Train is =
approximately a 5min  walk. Morgan Ave is close by as well. <br /> <br /> T=
he loft is located on the 2nd floor of an industrial building housing  othe=
r creative types and musicians. You would be living with 5 other  roommates=
 in their early 20's-everyone has their own individual private  rooms built=
 out. We have large common areas and there is one bathroom, a  full kitchen=
, project space, living room area, and a second platform  that we are conve=
rting to a dining area. We have a wall of windows,  super high ceilings in =
common areas, and a skylight-not the brightest  but helps kick the winter b=
lues.<br /> <br /> The rent is $600 month ALL utilities, internet, and hous=
e needs  included-down to dish soap and toilet paper. That being said we ar=
e  looking for a fellow creative not just looking for cheap rent. Move-in  =
is $1200 total (first month's rent and deposit). Rent is month-to-month,  w=
ith a month's notice upon moving out. We'd prefer someone looking to  stay =
at least 4-6 months minimum, but can sublet to the right person.  Move-in w=
ould be JAN 1st, but can likely be possible a few days early  due to New Ye=
ars! The room available is approx. 8x14, no window but  large space.<br /> =
<br /> What we ARE looking for:<br /> <br /> -We keep an all vegetarian kit=
chen and prefer another vegetarian-if  you're a meat eater that's cool, jus=
t dine out when you're craving a  steak :)<br /> -Someone queer/queer frien=
dly as 3 of us identify that way<br /> -Someone motivated and down to utili=
ze the space<br /> -Friendly and down to earth, we're not looking for a bes=
t bud but we definitely all get along<br /> -Carpentry skills would be a bo=
nus, any skill you could add to the house would be warmly welcomed.<br /> -=
Must be willing to take part in house chores, with 6 people living  under o=
ne roof it's a necessary evil. We're not clean freaks but follow a  simple =
chore wheel.<br /> <br /> What we are NOT looking for:<br /> <br /> -No har=
d drugs/heavy drinkers/ragers<br /> -Someone who brings the party home (we =
all have busy work schedules and respect each other's needs for sleep)<br /=
> -Someone who works from home<br /> -Someone late with rent-it's due on th=
e 1st of every month with no exceptions.<br /> <br /> If it sounds like a g=
ood fit, please send us a bit about yourself along  with your availability =

br /><br /> Hi,<br /> <br /> I am looking for a roommate starting Jan. 8-Ap=
ril 15 with the possibility to extend.  <br /> <br /> I live in a large rai=
lroad apartment in West Midtown Manhattan.  This  area is convenient, safe =
and happening.  I have lived here for 15 years.   I am looking for a person=
 who is responsible with a job and able to  pay upfront for the 3 plus mont=
hs with a money order or cashier's check.   If you are a student/intern, I =
ask for the same, to be able to pay for  the 3 plus months with a money ord=
er or cashier's check.  I don't mind  uploading pic's, but pictures do not =
show how spacious the apartment is,  so if you're in the area, I  invite yo=
u to come see the place vs pic's.<br /> <br /> I am looking for someone who=
 is easy going, please no drama or petty  issues.  A non-smoker and who lov=
es cats.  I have one adorable cat. <br /> <br /> The total rent for 14 week=
s includes the large, front room in a  furnished , railroad apartment, inte=
rnet, cable and all utilities.  I  will be out of town for one month from F=
eb-March, so you will also have  the apartment to yourself during that time=
.  I will be taking my cat,  but if you are a cat lover and a trustworthy c=
at caregiver, I will take a  percentage off the fee if we  both agree that =
you will take care of my  cat while I am gone.  (TBD)<br /> <br /> Please h=
ave two references, (past landlord/employer)<br /> Also, I do ask that we b=
oth sign a written agreement between the two of  us, confirming what we've =
discussed and agreed on.  This gives an  informal protection for both parti=
es.  Not un-common in NYC.<br /> <br /> Thanks and Happy 2012!!<br /> <br /=

00 per month, Carroll Gardens, 8x16, bright, colorful artist apartment clos=
e to everything.<br /> Available: February 1<br /><br /> I live in a three-=
bedroom apartment in Carroll Gardens. It's rent  stabilized, so it's still =
affordable enough to share with one other  person. This means that your hal=
f of the apartment includes not only a  private bedroom, way on the other s=
ide of the apartment from me, but  also half of an extra room, which is goo=
d for storage, house guests, and  office space.<br /> <br /> The apartment =
is on a pretty, tree-lined street a block and a half away  from the F and G=
 at Carroll. It has wood floors, bright colors on the  walls, breezes in th=
e summer, and free heat in the winter. There's a  nice cooking kitchen with=
 lots of space to work. Your room is medium  size, about 8x16, and has two =
windows. Utilities are about $75 per  month, which includes cable internet =
wifi, netflix, and renter's  insurance.<br /> <br /> I've been here for 10 =
years, and I've had three roommates in that time.  This is a good apartment=
. I'm in my late 30s, and I act like a grown-up  most of the time. I work h=
onest jobs at weird hours, so that means I'm  sometimes gone at night, or s=
leep during the day. I'm neat, but not  overbearing, and I'm fair to a faul=
t. I'm vegetarian, I ride a bike  every day, I like house guests, and I hav=
e a girlfriend. Sometimes I  like to sublet my room, and you are encouraged=
 to do that as well if you  travel. I don't smoke, drink, or do drugs, but =
I dont care if you do.<br /> <br /> I have a strong preference toward creat=
ive people with full time jobs  and busy social lives. You're, you know, aw=
esome. This room is not a  sublet. It's up for long-term rent with a 6-mont=
h try out period. I need  one-month's deposit when you sign a rental agreem=
ent, and your first  month when you move in. Please send me a note about yo=
urself and why  you're looking for a new place.<br /><br /> <a style=3D"col=

 immediately through indefinite<br /><br /> We (J, L, and J's dog) need a r=

ing for someone who doesn't work  9-5 and can give J's dog a midday walk. I=
n exchange, we are offering a  discounted rent: $375, plus your share of ut=
ilities (electricity, phone,  and internet). <br /> <br /> The apartment: W=
e just moved in. It's a 3-bedroom on the first floor of a  house in Ditmas =
Park. The owners, who live upstairs, take very good  care of it--it's nicel=
y renovated with some details left in place.  Living room, dining room, kit=
chen with dishwasher, front porch, lots of  closet space, foyer for coats, =
shoes, and bikes. Wood floors. Sunlight.<br /> <br /> The location: Ditmas =
Park. It's a neighborhood of big houses and big  trees. The house is on Wes=
tminster Road near Avenue H. Very close to the  Q train and not far from th=
e B. Short walk to the good stuff on  Cortelyou. More: ditmasparkblog.com. =
<br /> <br /> The room: It's tiny, 8x8. But it has a window, a door, and a =
closet. It  can definitely hold a queen-sized bed, although not much else. =
Much  could likely be accomplished with a loft bed. Of course, you are free=
 to  share the common spaces. There's room for your bike, books, kitchen  s=
tuff, etc, and a little furniture (depending). Available now.<br /> <br /> =
Us: J is a book production manager. Liberal, novice baker, lover of  craft =
beer, indie music, bad puns and baseball. Doggy parent. L is a  graphic des=
igner and illustrator. Vegetarian, lefty politics, maker of  bad puns, love=
s children's books, vintage things, and nerdy board games.  We are in our t=
hirties and are not a couple. J's dog is an active  45-pound mix who likes =
squeaky toys and hugs.<br /> <br /> Our household: We're members of the Dit=
mas Park CSA. We compost (in the  neighborhood!) and frequently share meals=
. Sometimes we have friends  over for dinner or board games. Visitors are g=
enerally welcome. We have a  Netflix subscription but no TV or cable. Have =
considered, but not yet  implemented, a NY Times subscription. Non-smokers.=
 Queer-friendly. <br /> <br /> You: Dog lover. Non-9-5er. Able to commit to=
 weekday dog-walking. Able  to pass the landlords' credit check and sign th=
e lease (their  requirements). Someone interested in making and sharing a h=
ome, not just  occupying a room. Creative energy appreciated! Special note:=
 We are  happy with roommates anywhere on the gender spectrum, but J's dog =
is  most at ease around women. Everyone is free to contact us, with that  c=
aveat. No additional pets, as that would be madness.<br /><br /> <a style=

hattan. The two live-ins are Cassidy - a sound guy  and me, Angela - an acc=
ountant with a day job in LIC. There is also  Jacques, my cat. We are in ou=
r early 30s/40s, affable and laid back, and  are looking to find another ro=
ommate with a compatible lifestyle to  share our loft.<br /> <br /> You sho=
uld be respectful, responsible, quiet enough, tidy, reasonably  mature, fon=

e  building is brand new, all new amenities, laundry on each floor.  Apartm=
ent is 1st floor with  a private terrace. G train is steps away  and Willia=
msburg is walking distance. Honestly getting into downtown  Manhattan takes=
 about 40 minutes even though it's very close, because of  the train layout=
. I usually use a very reliable car service nearby.  $20.00 into downtown M=
anhattan. More than plenty to do in the  neighborhood which i'll have poste=
d on the refrigerator. I'm a  dancer/choreographer/yoga instructor myself. =
Because I travel as often  as I do it would be most awesome to find someone=

00 per month, East Village, 300 sq ft, Sunny Single Bedroom Apartment in th=
e East Village<br /> Available: February 1 through April 31st<br /><br /> I=
 am subletting my darling single bedroom apartment in the East Village.   T=
he building is on a very charming street with coffee shops,  restaurants, v=
intage shops and very close access to Tompkins Square  Park.  It is a quick=
 walk to all the treasures of the lower east side-  the community gardens, =
Union Square Farmers Market, New Museum, Sunshine  Cinema, etc.<br /> <br /=
> The apartment is a four-story walk up, it will keep you in good shape!   =
It is very sunny and the building is quiet - full of working adults.   Ther=
e are three separate rooms in the apartment: a bedroom, a kitchen  and a li=
ving room.  The bathroom is the only 'catch' - the shower is in  the kitche=
n (which is so fun!) and the toilet is in a private, locked  little water c=
loset across the hall - for the exclusive use of whomever  occupies my apar=
tment.  In my experience, the positive qualities of the  apartment (locatio=
n, sunlight, convenience, quirkiness) have far  out-shined the bathroom iss=
ue.<br /> <br /> I am only moving out to save some money for graduate schoo=
l, I love this  apartment and I hope to find someone who will love it as we=
ll.  I'm  looking to find someone to start renting on Feb 1st until the lea=
se ends  on April 31st, however arrangements can also be made to rent the  =
apartment on a weekly basis, which would be $500 a week.<br /><br /> <a sty=

n Call, New York, Applications are open for The Work Office (TWO)<br /> Dat=
e: Deadline January 24, 2012<br /><br /> The Work Office (TWO) is now hirin=
g, in partnership with the Bronx River Art Center!<br /> <br /> As part of =
the "Shifting Communities" exhibition series at the Bronx  River Art Center=
 (BRAC) gallery, TWO is hiring artists to create and  present assignments w=
ith a focus on the Bronx, NY. Applications for TWO  employment are being ac=
cepted through January 24, 2012. Visit  www.theworkoffice.com or BRAC to ap=
ply.<br /> <br /> The Work Office (TWO) is a multidisciplinary art project =
disguised as an  employment agency. Informed by the Works Progress Administ=
ration (WPA)  of the Great Depression in the 1930s, TWO is a gesture to "ma=
ke work"  for visual and performing artists, writers, and others by giving =
them  simple, idea-based assignments that explore, document, and improve da=
ily  life in New York City. From a temporary, publicly accessible office  i=
nstalled at BRAC, TWO's administrators will hire employees, exhibit  work, =
and distribute Depression-era wages at a Payday Party on February  10. <br =
/> <br /> TWO is accepting applications for assignments that can be present=
ed at  BRAC's gallery. The proposals should explore the relationship betwee=
n  art and civic life and respond to the unique history and/or nature of  t=
he Bronx through one of the following TWO assignments:<br /> <br /> -build =
a bridge<br /> -reinterpret a newspaper photo<br /> -record an oral history=
 with someone who lives or works in the Bronx<br /> -design a poster to pro=
mote something<br /> -make a mixed CD related to places, people, or experie=
nces in the Bronx <br /> -catalog WPA structures in NY<br /> -document a ne=
ed for repairs<br /> -give a concert for a plant <br /> -make a regional tr=
avel guide for a place, neighborhood, or phenomenon in the Bronx<br /> -sta=
rt an American tradition<br /> -assign yourself<br /> <br /> Applications a=
nd instructions are available on TWO's  website-www.theworkoffice.com-and a=
t BRAC's gallery. A TWO administrator  will contact and interview applicati=
ons of interest by January 26.  Interviews will take place on January 27 an=
d 28. Applications are  evaluated based on the strength and clarity of the =
proposed response to  one of our assignments, its relationship to the Bronx=
, and the  practicality of realizing it within a week.<br /> <br /> Hired e=
mployees must be able to complete their assignments during the  workweek of=
 February 2-8, drop off work at the BRAC gallery on February  9, and attend=
 a public Payday Party on the evening of Friday, February  10. At the Payda=
y Party, artist/employees will collect their workweek  wage of $23.50 for t=
heir completed assignment, the same weekly wage that  artists received in t=
he Federal One Project (the arts division of the  WPA). The public will be =
invited to view the week's works and learn  about the project. Completed as=
signments will be publicly exhibited at  BRAC's gallery throughout the week=
 of February 11-18 and on TWO's  website.<br /> <br /> Applications must be=
 submitted by 11:59 PM, January 24.<br /> For more information about TWO, v=
isit: www.theworkoffice.com.<br /> <br /> BRAC is located @ Bronx Art Space=
