FAQ
Q: I've been applying for studies, but I haven't been picked. Why?

A: It could be a number of reasons. Perhaps the study is already full 
or you didn’t meet all of the criteria we were looking for. Don’t be 
discouraged! You won’t be accepted for every focus group. Keep trying 
and you should get an opportunity! It could also be that, the number you 
provided in you profile isn’t working, or you didn’t provide a number 
for us to reach you. Please take the time to update your profile, to 
ensure that you have provided a current phone number.


Thank you for your time and if you have any questions please feel free 
to contact me.
