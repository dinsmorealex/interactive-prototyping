Hot Wood Arts Center is an arts residency that provides affordable work  sp=
ace,=20
exhibition opportunities, and creative support to working members  of the a=
rts community
in Brooklyn. By bringing creative people together  from the typically dispa=
rate=20
fields of the visual and performing arts  and providing them a quality spac=
e in=20
which to work together, Hot Wood  hopes to encourage collaboration, inspira=
tion,
 and friendship in an  urban environment that typically promotes competitio=
n and
 isolation.
The Center is inside the Civil-War-era Beard Street Warehouse building  in =
Red Hook,
Brooklyn. It contains a full-service recording studio, 16  artist work spac=
es, a
 shared work area with tools and other equipment,  an art gallery, and a st=
age for
performances. One-year leases are  granted to 15 artist tenants, who are kn=
own as
the facility's  "residents" and receive, in addition to 24 hour access to t=
heir=20
work  spaces, a number of other benefits including free wi-fi, electricity,=
  use
 of common areas and tools, permanent links to their personal  websites fro=
m the
 Hot Wood Arts website, and constant exposure to  viewers. Each work space =
is fitted
with a glass door, so tenants can  curate the visible portion of their stud=
ios as
they see fit, as if they  had an ongoing, year-round gallery show. The faci=
lity=20
is open to the  public 12:00 - 4:00 on Friday, 12:00 - 6:00 Saturday and Su=
nday=20
(by  appointment at all other times) and during any gallery opening or  per=
formance
events, and residents will be encouraged to continually  display their work=
. Residents
keep 100% of revenue from any sales unless  the work being sold is curated =
in a=20
Hot Wood Gallery show.
The Hot Wood Gallery is curated by Megan Suttles, and focuses mostly on  no=
n-resident
artists, although residents are considered if their work  fits the theme of=
 the=20
show. Megan curates between five and seven shows  per year, and each show h=
as an
 opening event featuring a musical  performance in keeping with the show's =
theme.
The musical portion of  these events are curated by Mike Beck.

ROOMS FOR RENT

$675 per month, Park Slope, 9.5 feet by 6.5 feet, + shared necessities  ($2=
0ish),
(7th and Carroll), small private bedroom in 3BD apartment
Available: August 1st or 15th through June 2013?
Top floor apartment of brownstone with charm in and out--original  woodwork=
, claw-foot
tub, 9 ft ceiling, sunshine, roof access with a  gorgeous view, and amazing=
ly close
to Prospect Park. Bedroom is on the  small side, 9.5 x 6.5 ft, with built i=
n closet
space and a window. Best  for single occupancy, gender no matter.
Truth be told, the apartment layout is a bit breezy railroad. One of the  t=
hree=20
bedrooms is not-so-private, therefore respect is obviously  important. But =
lucky
 you, your room would be completely private. Current  roommate and I share =
a studio
space at one end of the apartment, our  rate is adjusted accordingly. This =
means
 home is a place of rest,  creative practice, and cheaper for you! We are a=
lso members
of the park  slope food co-op, which is located around the block. The addit=
ional
  roommate can be automatically accepted (no wait!) We hope the  availabili=
ty of
 awesome food is something that is important to you.
Transportation is an easy walk in several directions-- B Q R 2 3, lots  mor=
e a little
further at Atlantic Terminal, including C and G.

$1745 per month, Soho, Beautifully decorated and cute little Soho apartment=
 with
 lots of light.
Available: August 1st through Ongoing
This is a two bedroom in the heart of Soho on Spring and Thompson,  decorat=
ed with
cream and wicker Ralph Lauren furniture.  Both bedrooms  are exactly the sa=
me size
with windows that let in a lot of light and  have leafy trees outside.  The=
 neighbourhood
is wonderful and quaint  with lots of great restaurants, shops and cafes li=
ke Souen,
Local, The  Room, Raoul's and Organic Avenue.  It is located one block from=
 the=20
 A,C,E trains and five blocks along Spring street from the 4,5,6 trains  so=
 both
 the East and West side are easily accessible.  Soho is buzzing  with life =
and one
of the best areas in New York City.  My current flat  mate is unfortunately=
 moving
back to Mexico and so I have to find  someone to fill her space.  She is wa=
rm and
wonderful and a very  talented actress.  I am also an actress as well as an=
 entrepreneur
and  producer which means that I am working on a number of projects at the =
 moment
and have quite a few balls up in the air.  I am 25 and recently  finished s=
tudying
at The American Academy of Dramatic Arts.
I have many friends in the city who keep me busy in my spare time and  alth=
ough=20
I am very generous and friendly I like my independence.  I like  to keep a =
charming
home and am looking for someone who feels the same  way.  Also, i had a pro=
blem=20
with a past flat mate regarding her stealing  things from me so respect for=
 space
and mutual trust and care is very  important to me.  I am a South African w=
ith two
degrees who has been  living in New York for three years.
I love to travel and enjoy catching up with friends.  I am a creative  who =
enjoys
art, literature, cooking and lifestyle.  My three favourite  films are, 'St=
ealing
Beauty', 'I am Love' and 'Life is Beautiful'.  I'm  pretty easy going and g=
enerally
warm and full of positive energy.  I  would like someone who is the same.  =
My current
flat mate and I are kind  and respectful to each other, we do not have any =
time=20
for drama,  bitchiness or resentment.  We put all issues out in the open an=
d move
on  from them so communication is key so that no one holds grudges.  We are=
  relaxed
about boyfriends, friends or family coming to stay from time to  time as lo=
ng as
 they help out although this does not mean that I am  looking for two flatm=
ates.
  I like to go out when I can and will have  friends come over for tea, dri=
nks or
dinner from now and then and can't  live with people who are extremely anal=
.  If
 you drink my milk it's fine  just replace it and if the toilet paper finis=
hes just
go buy some more.   This is a mutual space of homely feeling, no rosters an=
d stinginess.
So if this sounds good for you please e-mail me, tell me a bit about  yours=
elf and
I will get back to you about meeting. Furniture in the room  is negotiable.

Available: August 1, 2012 through year to year lease
We are looking to fill a room that was recently freed up when our  long-tim=
e housemate
left us for domestic bliss. We have the top two  floors of a gorgeous 100+ =
year=20
old 3-story Victorian house in Ditmas  Park, complete with backyard, front =
yard,
 front porch (with a porch  swing!), two full bathrooms (one with a clawed-=
foot=20
tub), and two  friendly cats. Our neighborhood feels very much like a small=
 town
 in the  middle of the city - we hear crickets at night and are surrounded =
by  trees,
but food and transportation are at the end of the street. We have  pizza, 2=
4-hour
delis, Chinese, and sushi half a block away, bars,  cafes, and restaurants =
around
the corner, a food coop at the end of the  street, and are 3 blocks south o=
f Prospect
Park.
There are currently three of us living together looking for a fourth,  dude=
s and
 dudettes welcome. We are artists, educators, actors, graduate  students, b=
icycle
and gardening enthusiasts from all parts of the  country (California, Color=
ado,=20
and Oregon/New York). Because this is an  old house we do need to be respec=
tful=20
of it. We believe in doing dishes  and keeping our common areas and bathroo=
ms clean
- but also cracking  open a bottle of wine and some netflix if we happen to=
 all=20
be home at  the same time. We are working and responsible adults with activ=
e social
 lives, in our twenties (27 and 29), laid-back and upbeat, and hope to  fin=
d like-minded
individuals to share our home. Cigarette smokers must  go outside, and no m=
ore pets
would be preferable.
The space we have available is a large sloped-ceiling room on the top  floo=
r that's
rectangular in shape with a bay window in the center. It  measures 16'9" x =
8'8"=20
and 11'8" deep at the bay window area which is  7'3" wide. It's been freshl=
y carpeted
since the departure of our  housemate, comes unfurnished, and is available =
for move-in
July 1st  (dates negotiable, we can do earlier or later). It has three wind=
ows =20
(two small and one large), an air-conditioner, and a large closet with  she=
lving
 units. The price of the room includes all utilities and free  internet.

$1000 per month, South Park Slope, 180 sq. ft., Spacious furnished sunny ro=
om in
 gorgeous loft
Available: Immediately through Unlimited
The perfect room that will give you great living and flexibility if you  ne=
ed it!
Rented month-to-month and we only need the first month upfront  & reference=
s. $1000
rent + $200 for all utilities and cleaning  service every two weeks.
The room is just larger than 10 ft wide by 18 ft long in a 1900 sq. ft.  3-=
bedroom
apartment. There is a very comfortable twin-size bed (with  another twin tr=
undle
 underneath), shelving, and a newly renovated closet  with two hanging rods=
 and=20
8 shelves. There is a desk, chair, and a  lamp. There are 2 south facing wi=
ndows,
so the room gets a lot of light  all day. There is a ceiling fan and a smal=
l A/C
 unit in one window. Room  also includes high speed internet on a wireless =
network
and cleaning  service every two weeks.
You will share a bathroom (spacious approx. 7x8ft with a sink, toilet,  and=
 shower/bath)
with a friendly and clean roommate. You also have full  access to a laundry=
 room
 with a washer & dryer and drying rack as  well as a big open kitchen with =
top-of-the-line
appliances.
We are looking for a responsible working professional interested in  living=
 in a
 nice, clean home (and not a dorm-like college roommate  situation with dis=
hes piled
up and loud parties!) We work from home so  we are looking for someone who =
won't.
We are two academics and a working professional who are friendly, but  resp=
ectful
of your space & time. We could cook together, but also  rarely see each oth=
er (two
of us have our own bedroom on the opposite  ends of a 100 ft long apartment=
.) The
only pets in the apartment are  fish in an aquarium.
The apartment is a block and a half away from the R/M train at Prospect  Av=
e, and
three stops from Atlantic/Pacific where you can connect to most  other subw=
ay lines
(and express trains, one stop from Manhattan). The  bike lane up 5th Ave. i=
s just
steps away as well as a bus that can take  you to the busier part of Park S=
lope.
 Across the street is the awesome  arts collective, Madarts (www.madarts.or=
g) with
a great community of  artists working and living in the loft apartments abo=
ve it.
Within two  blocks are Freddy's (bar), Roots Cafe (coffee + food + live mus=
ic),=20
Lot 2  (local new American food), Toby's (pizza + beer + homemade beef jerk=
y!)
Our area is the South part of Park Slope, officially called Greenwood  Heig=
hts.=20
We are a 15 minute walk from Prospect Park. The warm weather is  here - you=
 can=20
picnic, sunbathe, run, bicycle, or even go to outdoor  concerts or movies!
We will need one professional and one personal reference as well as the fir=
st month
upfront.
Email us if interested or for more information!

$735 per month, Greenpoint, 10 ft. by 10 ft., GREAT ROOM FOR RENT WITH ROOF=
TOP AND
GARDEN ACCESS
Available: 08/15/2012 through 02/15/2013
I am looking for a fabulous lady to move into the third room in a  three-be=
droom
 flat, with me and one other girl, in mid-August. We're  planning on signin=
g a six-month
lease (through mid-February) but can  always extend it then if we feel like=
 it.
ABOUT THE ROOM:
Small, but comfortable, with a large closet; there is enough room for a  de=
sk or
 a sofa and a queen-sized bed. I should probably also mention  that there i=
s no=20
window... But the room's previous occupant said that in  the end this did n=
ot bother
her at all.
ABOUT THE APARTMENT:
You will be living with two other girls in their twenties, both of whom  wo=
rk in
 the arts. I am British, and the other girl is American. There is  a shared=
 kitchen/living
room, a nice garden (looking for someone to  give it some love) and a rooft=
op with
the most amazing view of the  Manhattan skyline.
ABOUT YOU:
Female, non-smoker, no pets, kind, great sense of humor, clean, neat and  s=
ocial,
but respectful of other people's privacy and work schedules.
So... If you want to live in happening Greenpoint on a nice and quiet  stre=
et, let
me know and I will set up a showing of the room for you this  weekend!

$850 per month, Greenpoint, Cozy Room in Small But Sweet 2bdrm in great nei=
ghborhood!
Available: 08/01/12 through 09/09/12
I have a lovely little Greenpoint apartment - filled with light and  plants=
 and=20
books and in a great neighborhood. I will be traveling for  most of August =
(definitely
from 08/15 but could sublet earlier if need  be!) through September 9th and=
 would
like to sublet my room for part or  all of the time.  Happy to work out a p=
rice=20
that fits the time you'd  like to stay! I am renting the 2nd room (in the p=
hotos)
which has a pull  out futon bed and large windows letting in lots of light.=
 The=20
only  thing you would need to do is water the plants!
My lovely and quiet roommate will be in the main bedroom - she's an NYU  gr=
ad student
who works long weekdays and studies a lot (and cooks some  mean dishes).  S=
he's=20
leaving September 1st so you would have the place  to yourself for the firs=
t week
of September, and if you wanted to sublet  her room once she's gone for lon=
ger through
September that is  definitely negotiable.
We're on the 4th floor of an old building with lots of windows and there  a=
re 2=20
separate bedrooms - cozy, but private. The apartment is small, so  it would=
 work
 best for someone who doesn't have a lot of stuff.  But  for a short stay i=
t might
be the perfect cozy home to go out and explore  the city or as a midway in =
between
moving.
Just around the corner are great bars, coffee shops, yummy restaurants,  bo=
utiques,
one of the best natural grocery stores in BK, etc, etc! There  are a lot of=
 artists
in the neighborhood, and its on the quieter side  from Williamsburg and sou=
th Greenpoint
and it has a great neighborhood  vibe.
We are right by the G train which links up with the L into Manhattan (I  wo=
rk in
 lower Manhattan, and it takes about a half an hour to get in).  We are als=
o right
by the 7 train and it takes 20 mins to get to Times  Square.
Thanks!

$1300 per month, Manhattan / Brooklyn, House-trained female, mid-30s, seeki=
ng apartment
Available: 1 September through ongoing
Hello,
I'm a female journalist in my mid-30s, looking for a great apartment to  be=
 my new
home in New York. Both my move date and price range are  flexible to an ext=
ent,=20
as my first priority is finding the right place.  I'm happy to share with o=
ne other
(maybe two, depending on the people)  or rent an apartment solo.
My preferred areas are Williamsburg, Greenpoint, Carroll Gardens, LES,  Eas=
t Village
or West Village. Again, I can be flexible for the right  place though good =
transport
links are essential.
About me: I'm reliable, tidy, respectful, cheery and drama-free. An  adult,=
 in other
words. While from New Zealand originally, I've lived in  various other part=
s of=20
the world before arriving in NYC earlier this  year, and currently write fo=
r a wine
magazine, as well as a range of  architecture, design and art titles.
I work mostly from home so would prefer room mates who don't, and good  lig=
ht and
space in the apartment. However, I will also be traveling  occasionally, an=
d I am
often out at night. My work stuff is  super-minimal (laptop, notebook) and =
will=20
not be taking over any shared  space. Generally, I keep a very clear divisi=
on between
work and being  off-duty at home, even if it means hiding my work somewhere=
 so I
 can't  see it!
Ideally, I'd like a long-term set-up, but happy to consider a sublet  from =
September
to December  as it's likely I'll be traveling in Dec/Jan.
Please do get in touch if you have something that might work.
Cheers,
Sam

d shop, new arts center on the waterfront in brooklyn with 15  visual artis=
t studios for rent.<br /> Available: July 15<br /><br /> Includes 17'x10' p=
rivate space, common area, wifi, trash, water, electric, woodshop, open stu=
dios every weekend<br /> <br /> Studios will be available for rent July 15t=
h and August 1st! If you are  interested in being a Hot Wood Arts resident =
please email us with an  updated website, or at least five j-peg images of =
your work along with a  resume.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Hot Wood Arts Cent=
er is an arts residency that provides affordable work  space, exhibition op=
portunities, and creative support to working members  of the arts community=
 in Brooklyn. By bringing creative people together  from the typically disp=
arate fields of the visual and performing arts  and providing them a qualit=
y space in which to work together, Hot Wood  hopes to encourage collaborati=
on, inspiration, and friendship in an  urban environment that typically pro=
motes competition and isolation.<br /> <br /> The Center is inside the Civi=
l-War-era Beard Street Warehouse building  in Red Hook, Brooklyn. It contai=
ns a full-service recording studio, 16  artist work spaces, a shared work a=
rea with tools and other equipment,  an art gallery, and a stage for perfor=
mances. One-year leases are  granted to 15 artist tenants, who are known as=
 the facility's  "residents" and receive, in addition to 24 hour access to =
their work  spaces, a number of other benefits including free wi-fi, electr=
icity,  use of common areas and tools, permanent links to their personal  w=
ebsites from the Hot Wood Arts website, and constant exposure to  viewers. =
Each work space is fitted with a glass door, so tenants can  curate the vis=
ible portion of their studios as they see fit, as if they  had an ongoing, =
year-round gallery show. The facility is open to the  public 12:00 - 4:00 o=
n Friday, 12:00 - 6:00 Saturday and Sunday (by  appointment at all other ti=
mes) and during any gallery opening or  performance events, and residents w=
ill be encouraged to continually  display their work. Residents keep 100% o=
f revenue from any sales unless  the work being sold is curated in a Hot Wo=
od Gallery show.<br /> <br /> The Hot Wood Gallery is curated by Megan Sutt=
les, and focuses mostly on  non-resident artists, although residents are co=
nsidered if their work  fits the theme of the show. Megan curates between f=
ive and seven shows  per year, and each show has an opening event featuring=
 a musical  performance in keeping with the show's theme. The musical porti=
on of  these events are curated by Mike Beck. <br /> <br /> For more inform=

45 per month, Soho, Beautifully decorated and cute little Soho apartment wi=
th lots of light.<br /> Available: August 1st through Ongoing<br /><br /> T=
his is a two bedroom in the heart of Soho on Spring and Thompson,  decorate=
d with cream and wicker Ralph Lauren furniture.  Both bedrooms  are exactly=
 the same size with windows that let in a lot of light and  have leafy tree=
s outside.  The neighbourhood is wonderful and quaint  with lots of great r=
estaurants, shops and cafes like Souen, Local, The  Room, Raoul's and Organ=
ic Avenue.  It is located one block from the  A,C,E trains and five blocks =
along Spring street from the 4,5,6 trains  so both the East and West side a=
re easily accessible.  Soho is buzzing  with life and one of the best areas=
 in New York City.  My current flat  mate is unfortunately moving back to M=
exico and so I have to find  someone to fill her space.  She is warm and wo=
nderful and a very  talented actress.  I am also an actress as well as an e=
ntrepreneur and  producer which means that I am working on a number of proj=
ects at the  moment and have quite a few balls up in the air.  I am 25 and =
recently  finished studying at The American Academy of Dramatic Arts.  <br =
/> <br /> I have many friends in the city who keep me busy in my spare time=
 and  although I am very generous and friendly I like my independence.  I l=
ike  to keep a charming home and am looking for someone who feels the same =
 way.  Also, i had a problem with a past flat mate regarding her stealing  =
things from me so respect for space and mutual trust and care is very  impo=
rtant to me.  I am a South African with two degrees who has been  living in=
 New York for three years.  <br /> <br /> I love to travel and enjoy catchi=
ng up with friends.  I am a creative  who enjoys art, literature, cooking a=
nd lifestyle.  My three favourite  films are, 'Stealing Beauty', 'I am Love=
' and 'Life is Beautiful'.  I'm  pretty easy going and generally warm and f=
ull of positive energy.  I  would like someone who is the same.  My current=
 flat mate and I are kind  and respectful to each other, we do not have any=
 time for drama,  bitchiness or resentment.  We put all issues out in the o=
pen and move on  from them so communication is key so that no one holds gru=
dges.  We are  relaxed about boyfriends, friends or family coming to stay f=
rom time to  time as long as they help out although this does not mean that=
 I am  looking for two flatmates.  I like to go out when I can and will hav=
e  friends come over for tea, drinks or dinner from now and then and can't =
 live with people who are extremely anal.  If you drink my milk it's fine  =
just replace it and if the toilet paper finishes just go buy some more.   T=
his is a mutual space of homely feeling, no rosters and stinginess.<br /> <=
br /> So if this sounds good for you please e-mail me, tell me a bit about =
 yourself and I will get back to you about meeting. Furniture in the room  =
is negotiable.<br /><br /> <a style=3D"color: black;" shape=3D"rect" href=

 Ditmas  Park, complete with backyard, front yard, front porch (with a porc=

 of the city - we hear crickets at night and are surrounded by  trees, but =
food and transportation are at the end of the street. We have  pizza, 24-ho=
ur delis, Chinese, and sushi half a block away, bars,  cafes, and restauran=
ts around the corner, a food coop at the end of the  street, and are 3 bloc=
ks south of Prospect Park. <br /> <br /> There are currently three of us li=

ists, educators, actors, graduate  students, bicycle and gardening enthusia=
sts from all parts of the  country (California, Colorado, and Oregon/New Yo=
rk). Because this is an  old house we do need to be respectful of it. We be=
lieve in doing dishes  and keeping our common areas and bathrooms clean - b=
ut also cracking  open a bottle of wine and some netflix if we happen to al=
l be home at  the same time. We are working and responsible adults with act=
ive social  lives, in our twenties (27 and 29), laid-back and upbeat, and h=
ope to  find like-minded individuals to share our home. Cigarette smokers m=
ust  go outside, and no more pets would be preferable.<br /> <br /> The spa=

s rectangular in shape with a bay window in the center. It  measures 16'9" =
x 8'8" and 11'8" deep at the bay window area which is  7'3" wide. It's been=
 freshly carpeted since the departure of our  housemate, comes unfurnished,=
 and is available for move-in July 1st  (dates negotiable, we can do earlie=
r or later). It has three windows  (two small and one large), an air-condit=

-size bed (with  another twin trundle underneath), shelving, and a newly re=

, and a  lamp. There are 2 south facing windows, so the room gets a lot of =
light  all day. There is a ceiling fan and a small A/C unit in one window. =
Room  also includes high speed internet on a wireless network and cleaning =

dryer and drying rack as  well as a big open kitchen with top-of-the-line a=

 apartment is a block and a half away from the R/M train at Prospect  Ave, =
and three stops from Atlantic/Pacific where you can connect to most  other =
subway lines (and express trains, one stop from Manhattan). The  bike lane =
up 5th Ave. is just steps away as well as a bus that can take  you to the b=
usier part of Park Slope. Across the street is the awesome  arts collective=
, Madarts (www.madarts.org) with a great community of  artists working and =
living in the loft apartments above it. Within two  blocks are Freddy's (ba=
r), Roots Cafe (coffee + food + live music), Lot 2  (local new American foo=
d), Toby's (pizza + beer + homemade beef jerky!)<br /> <br /> Our area is t=
he South part of Park Slope, officially called Greenwood  Heights. We are a=
 15 minute walk from Prospect Park. The warm weather is  here - you can pic=
nic, sunbathe, run, bicycle, or even go to outdoor  concerts or movies!<br =

0 per month, Greenpoint, Cozy Room in Small But Sweet 2bdrm in great neighb=
orhood!<br /> Available: 08/01/12 through 09/09/12<br /><br /> I have a lov=
ely little Greenpoint apartment - filled with light and  plants and books a=
nd in a great neighborhood. I will be traveling for  most of August (defini=
tely from 08/15 but could sublet earlier if need  be!) through September 9t=
h and would like to sublet my room for part or  all of the time.  Happy to =
work out a price that fits the time you'd  like to stay! I am renting the 2=
nd room (in the photos) which has a pull  out futon bed and large windows l=
etting in lots of light. The only  thing you would need to do is water the =
plants!  <br /> <br /> My lovely and quiet roommate will be in the main bed=
room - she's an NYU  grad student who works long weekdays and studies a lot=
 (and cooks some  mean dishes).  She's leaving September 1st so you would h=
ave the place  to yourself for the first week of September, and if you want=
ed to sublet  her room once she's gone for longer through September that is=
  definitely negotiable. <br /> <br /> We're on the 4th floor of an old bui=
lding with lots of windows and there  are 2 separate bedrooms - cozy, but p=
rivate. The apartment is small, so  it would work best for someone who does=
n't have a lot of stuff.  But  for a short stay it might be the perfect coz=
y home to go out and explore  the city or as a midway in between moving. <b=
r /> <br /> Just around the corner are great bars, coffee shops, yummy rest=
aurants,  boutiques, one of the best natural grocery stores in BK, etc, etc=
! There  are a lot of artists in the neighborhood, and its on the quieter s=
ide  from Williamsburg and south Greenpoint and it has a great neighborhood=
  vibe.<br /> <br /> We are right by the G train which links up with the L =
into Manhattan (I  work in lower Manhattan, and it takes about a half an ho=
ur to get in).  We are also right by the 7 train and it takes 20 mins to ge=
t to Times  Square.<br /> <br /> Thanks!<br /> Hannah<br /><br /> <a style=

 room. One room is furnished with a  bookshelf and an almost new full size =
bed. Floors are all dark wood.  One can be used as a sitting /living room a=
nd the other as a bedroom.  Includes air conditioning unit. These rooms are=
 at the front of the  apartment with a private entrance (not a railroad apa=
rtment). Shared  bathroom and large kitchen/common space in the middle of t=

aker/producer and am also a yoga teacher who lives a holistic  life. I tend=

ople over and socialize outside of home. I occasionally  work from home and=
 often travel for work. I like to keep common areas  clean at all times and=

 apartment solo. <br /> <br /> My preferred areas are Williamsburg, Greenpo=

lexible for the right  place though good transport links are essential.<br =

An  adult, in other words. While from New Zealand originally, I've lived in=
  various other parts of the world before arriving in NYC earlier this  yea=
r, and currently write for a wine magazine, as well as a range of  architec=
ture, design and art titles. <br /> <br /> I work mostly from home so would=
 prefer room mates who don't, and good  light and space in the apartment. H=
owever, I will also be traveling  occasionally, and I am often out at night=
. My work stuff is  super-minimal (laptop, notebook) and will not be taking=
 over any shared  space. Generally, I keep a very clear division between wo=
rk and being  off-duty at home, even if it means hiding my work somewhere s=
o I can't  see it!<br /> <br /> Ideally, I'd like a long-term set-up, but h=
appy to consider a sublet  from September to December  as it's likely I'll =
be traveling in Dec/Jan.  <br /> <br /> Please do get in touch if you have =

 I'm a book and magazine writer. I moved from Brooklyn to Marfa five  years=

 and it's always gone well.<br /> <br /> September and October are the best=
 months to visit Marfa. The weather is  perfect: sunny and warm in afternoo=
ns, cool in AM and late evenings.  You'd be there for the largest music/art=
 gatherings; in September, El  Cosmico hosts a big music festival, and Chin=
ati Open House, Marfa's  largest art weekend, is in October.<br /> <br /> M=
y house is in the town proper, and it's set up for a writer or artist  -- q=
uiet, calm, wireless, with the 2nd bedroom as an office. There's a  working=
 fireplace, a great porch with sunset views, and a huge bathroom  with a fr=
eestanding sink and an excellent bathtub. You can use my bike,  streaming N=
etflix, etc.<br /> <br /> I also have a very independent and low-maintenanc=

water plants/etc in  return.<br /><br /> <a style=3D"color: black;" shape=
