$4000 per month, Soho, 1100 Square Feet, Classic Loft Ideal for Studio or O=
ffice
 Space - Spacious and Beautifully Renovated
Available: 2/15/2013 through 12/31/2017
The space is located on Broadway and Broome and can be leased either long t=
erm or
short term - 5 months > 5 years.
It is a four floor building from the 1900s and I have the entire 4th floor.
I am looking to rent the back half of the floor - which is completely separ=
ate -
 own door access through lobby, own mailbox.
The building is clean and well maintained and the the two other floors are =
occupied
by reputable, young creative companies.
The 4th floor has been restored recently, with efforts made to preserve  al=
l of=20
the original features - immaculate hardwood floors, loft beam  ceilings, va=
ulted
 skylights, sash windows, track lighting, plenty of  outlets, baseboard as =
well=20
as radiator heating, new bathroom, lobby...
There is an arts magazine which is interested in sharing the space and  spl=
itting
the rent down the middle but it would be ideal to keep the  space for the m=
ost part
open plan so this would only be a possibility  for a cooperative and like m=
inded
 organization/individual. I am open to  tenants creating their own shares a=
s well.
It has good light and is quiet as it faces the back of the building -  the =
view=20
is of a large open space between old Soho buildings and the  skyline of Mer=
cer Street.
I am looking for someone to start in mid February/beginning of March -  thi=
s can
 be a flexible sublease starting with a minimum 5 month initial  commitment=
. First
month and 1 month security down.
Please note this is a walk up - one longer flight of stairs and another sho=
rter=20
one to the top floor.

$750 per month, Bed Stuy, 10x8 feet, Cozy sunlit room with a beautiful view
Available: starting February 20 through open ended
My name is Jeanne and I recently moved from San Francisco to NY. I found  a=
 beautiful
2 br apartment in a 1930's building in the heart of Bed  Stuy and I'm looki=
ng for
a like-minded roommate (male or female) to  share it with me.
I am a 31 year old film editor/assistant editor and often work from  home s=
o I would
like to live with someone who has a day job/classes  during the day. I am l=
ooking
for a mellow, respectful person who wants a  clean and calm household. I am=
 friendly
and social and hope to live  with someone who I really get along with, but =
I tend
to be on the quiet  side when I'm home. I have a great group of friends and=
 family
here so  am out most nights for dinners, movies, plays and shows but like t=
o come
 home to a quiet haven where I can be in bed by midnight on weeknights!
The room:
The room is on the small side, but has a large window with pretty  moulding=
 and=20
a fire escape for enjoying the warm summer nights. There is  no closet in t=
he room
(you would need a dresser or armoire) but there  is some space available to=
 hang
 clothes in the hall closet.
The apartment:
Please note: since the pictures were taken I painted the bathroom blue  and=
 put=20
up shelves in the living room. The apartment is fully furnished  (furniture=
 is still
being shipped from CA so isn't in pictures..living  room will have a nice w=
ooden
 dining room table, record player and couch -  no TV!) so please plan to br=
ing your
bedroom furniture and some kitchen  stuff if you have that, but unfortunate=
ly there
isn't room for any more  furniture in the living room.
The building is clean and pretty, with 1930's details and the apartment  it=
self=20
feels like a little jewel box - hardwood floors, nice bathroom  and new app=
liances
in the kitchen. It's on the fourth floor and there's a  great view of the M=
anhattan
skyline.
The kitchen is quite small so if you are really into cooking this may  be f=
rustrating
for you. I have come up with a few ingenious ways to make  cooking easier w=
ith the
limited space (big cutting board over the sink  makes more counter space..)=
 but=20
I only cook a couple of times a week  (and by cook I mean boil water and to=
ss something
in) so I am happy with  the minimalist kitchen!
The location:
The location is great: it's right on Lewis near the Stuyvesant Heights  his=
torical
district. Peaches and Saraghina restaurants, 24 hour organic  grocery store=
, multiple
delis, beautiful little library, Therapy wine  bar and more restaurants/caf=
es are
all close by. 10 min walk to A  express train to Manhattan (A/C at Utica an=
d C at
Kingston/Throop) or 15  minute walk to the M stop at Gates. The A/C also co=
nnects
to the G in 2  stops @ Hoyt-Schemerhorn (or B52 bus drops off near the G). =
The J/M/Z
 and L connect one stop away at Broadway Junction.

$1100 per month, Williamsburg, 1200 sq. feet, Bedroom available in prime Wi=
lliamsburg
4BR/2Bath
Available: March 15, 2013 through August 31, 2013
I'm moving out to take on a friend's rent-stabilized apartment after  livin=
g in=20
this conveniently located, 4 bedroom/2 bath apartment for 2. 5  years. Rent=
 would
be paid to me (I'm moving in the neighborhood) every  month. I would requir=
e you
 to sign a standard subleaser agreement. First  month's rent and one month =
security
($2200) are required to move in.
The lease is up August 31st, at which time you'll have the opportunity  to =
put your
name on the lease if you and the roommates decide to  re-sign.
Your bedroom is situated just off the living room, has nearly a full  wall =
of east
facing windows, and easily fits a queen sized bed, desk and  bureau (that's=
 what
 is in there currently, pictured.) With your room,  you get a full closet t=
o yourself
which is in the living room. You share  a bathroom with one roommate.
The three roommates are clean, non-smoking, nice ladies names Kate, Kait  a=
nd Mehgan.
Kate works in Advertising Operations for a blog platform  and is a marathon=
 runner
for fun. Kait works in interior design (hence  our stylish living room). Me=
hgan=20
is a graphic designer. You would be the  fourth roommate.
The building has a huge (10,000 sq. ft.+) roofdeck and gym upstairs. The  g=
ym is
 equipped treadmill, 2 exercise bikes, an elliptical and free  weights. The=
re is
 a washer dryer in the unit (no more paying for  laundry!).
ConEd, Time Warner (just wireless internet) and National Grid bills  total =
about
 $40/person/month. Currently we have cable TV with DVR -- if  you'd like to=
 chip
 in to use that, you can discuss with the roommates.
The neighborhood is prime Williamsburg at 525 Union Avenue (between  Meeker=
 and=20
Withers). It's a 3 minute walk from the Lorimer L (Union Ave  entrance) or =
Metropolitan
G. Bedford and N. 7th is a 10 minute walk. The  JMZ at Marcy is 15 minutes =
away.
 There's a new bar called The Exley  across the street and a specialty beer=
 store
right downstairs.
Please contact me with any questions or to view the apartment.

$787.50 per month, Bushwick, Sunny and spacious room in a bright, homey apa=
rtment
Available: March 1 through ongoing
Come live in my beautiful Bushwick apartment!  The corner bedroom has  open=
ed up
 for a new roommate from March 1-onward.  It's bright, sunny (4  windows), =
BIG (used
to be the living room ages ago), so bring your  king-sized bed - it will fi=
t - and
has a new closet.  The apartment  itself was "spruced up" in October: new d=
rywall,
new fixtures, new  closet doors, refinished floors, new fixtures in the bat=
hroom,
and a  completely redone kitchen.  It's just adorable.  And we have a  wash=
er-dryer
unit. It's a corner unit, so it gets lots of light, stays  relatively cool =
in the
summer, and my landlord is NOT stingy with the  heat, so we are toasty from=
 November-April.
The neighborhood is trendy,  and on the up-and-up: we're blocks from Northe=
ast Kingdom,
1 block from  Hana, across the street from Pearl's, and there are about 4 o=
ther=20
bars  in the 4 block radius, plus a new juice bar, a few coffee shops, and =
 Bathaus
coworking space across the street. 1 Block from the train.   Literally. And=
 we have
an awesome building super - very attentive, and  very friendly.
Photos are of the bedroom, only - and the room will be unfurnished.  The  b=
ed in
 the photos is a full-size bed, to give you an idea of the size  of the roo=
m.
About me: I split my time between my music and art: I teach violin,  perfor=
m on=20
the weekends, and am at my studio playing with clay when I'm  not doing one=
 of those.
 I do my socializing outside of the home, and I  chill at the apartment.  O=
nce in
a blue moon, I'll have a friend over  for drinks or dinner. My schedule var=
ies,=20
and I use the apartment as my  space to recharge before attacking the next =
thing
 for the day.  It's my  home.
A few rules: if you can't jive with these, we won't get along, and I wish y=
ou luck
elsewhere:
1) NO DRUGS, NO DRUG DEALING, NO FUNNY STUFF. Period.  But you can smoke  c=
igarettes
out your window (I do) or on the fire escape.
2) No revolving door of hook-ups, one-night stands, friends-from-afar,  and=
 distant
relations.  This is a home, not a hotel. NB: guests are cool  on a case-by-=
case=20
basis, after discussion of length of stay, etc.  More  on that topic in per=
son.
3) No pets. :( Landlord said so.  But service animals are fine.
So, all I know about you is that: 1) you're employed 2) work outside of  th=
e home
3) and are a communicative, peaceful, non-passive-aggressive  individual.  =
If you're
interested in the place, tell me me more about  yourself, what you do, how =
you spend
your time, and your idea of a home.   If you can jive with the above, you h=
ave a
 couch, and you know who  Augustine, Clive Staples Lewis, Gilbert Keith Che=
sterton,
J.P. Moreland  and Tommy Peoples are, (one of these things is not like the =
others)...
 we'll get along fine.  Shoot me an email to set up a time to see the  rest=
 of the
apt, and for me to figure out who you are.

$850 per month, Bushwick, 8x15, Great Room With Incredible Natural Light in=
 Friendly
Apartment
Available: 3/1/2013 through 3/1/2014
The Apartment:
A fully furnished, 950 sq. ft., 3-bedroom apartment with 12 ft.  ceilings, =
smack
 dab between the Montrose and Morgan stops off the L. We  have a dishwasher=
 AND=20
laundry in the building (I know!). Lots to do in  the area: bars, coffee sh=
ops,=20
fancy restaurants, not-so-fancy  restaurants, venues, flea markets, kind of=
 grimy
parks. 5-minute walk to  the train, and a 20-minute ride to Union Sq.
The Room:
Modestly sized at approx. 8x15ft, but tall ceilings and 9-foot  wall-to-wal=
l windows
make it feel much bigger. Room has a ceiling fan,  as well as individually =
controlled
AC and heat. Unless you have a ton of  stuff (in which case you probably ar=
en't=20
the ideal roommate for us),  you should fit very comfortably. Rent is 850 d=
ollars
a month and  includes gas, electric, water, cable internet and a bi-weekly =
cleaning
 lady (she's awesome).
The Roommates:
There are three of us -- all in our middish/late 20s. A couple in the  big =
room=20
(Him: a high school teacher. Her: a copywriter), and one other  dude (does =
fancy
 things for the Department of Education) in a room  approx. the same size a=
s yours.
We like each other a bunch, and would like to keep the current open,  consi=
derate,
and tidy environment going strong. We all have big kid  jobs, but our hours=
 are=20
slightly staggered, so sometimes we will go for a  few days without seeing =
each=20
other. We do not really party in the house  (though we are all social drink=
ers/=20
nonsmokers) but we do occasionally  have roof parties (the roof is GINORMOU=
S).
You:
You do you - as long as you are nice, and not dumb, or too noisy, and  can =
respect
other people's boundaries. People who like books and sports  and art and ma=
th and
.gifs and food and beer and wine are especially  encouraged to apply. We're=
 all=20
generally out of the house between 7am  and 7pm, so it would be nice if you=
 kept
 a similar schedule (although we  all share a bathroom, so ideally you aren=
't a=20
super early riser).
The Rent:
You will need first, last and one month security to move in (First  roommat=
e test:
850 dollars times 3) Rent is due on the first of the  month and includes ga=
s, electric,
water, cable internet and a bi-weekly  cleaning lady (again, she's awesome)=

apt with me and my pup in Chinatown
Available: End of Feb through 1 year
About me: I'm 23, queer, female with an adorable corgi named Monty.  Obviou=
sly,=20
you would need to be okay with these facts.I like to keep a  clean home- es=
pecially
the kitchen/dishes stuff. Also, I would prefer to  keep a no-shoes house (y=
eah,=20
I even wipe Monty's feet at the door)  cause there is some nasty stuff goin=
g on=20
in the streets and you know  that. Other than that, I'm super sociable and =
outgoing,
I love to  cook/bake and eat (mostly veg though).
About you:
Male or Female, dog and lgbtq friendly. Not passive aggressive or a  hermit=
 that
 treats me like an oddity.We don't have to be BFF, but being  friendly woul=
d be=20
a plus since no one likes being uncomfortable in their  own home right? You=
 always
clean up after yourself. And give me a  warning when you bring someone over=
. We=20
can throw small get-togethers  and dinner parties on our huge terrace this =
summer.
If I can have  friends crash on our couch once in a while, so can you. Resp=
ectful
and  quiet during sleepy time though.
Last but not least, you have 3x the monthly rent (2 months for the  securit=
y deposit
and the rent for March). The total cost depends if you  choose to take the =

terrace that wraps around the building (only 4  apts have direct access lik=
e us,
 plus one public door). It's a one  bedroom apartment that was recently ren=
ovated,

bedroom
I am renting  out is 12ft by 11ft with a closet 6ft wide and 3ft deep for $=
1150.
 OR  you can take the partitioned living room for $900, but I would need so=
me  access
to the patio doors so Monty and I don't trample on you. The  kitchen has ne=
w granite
counter tops and cabinets. I want to to leave a  portion of the living room=
 for=20
a couch/coffee table as a communal space.  The total rent we are splitting =
is $2050/month
with heat and water  included, no fee. We have to pay for AC/electricity an=

 is $750.
Bills (gas, electric, internet, cable) usually  come out to about $100 a mo=

u. No
 pets allowed, and no smoking in  the apartment.
We're pretty laid back and easy to get along with, and fall slightly on  th=

 I was able to meet with a few folks and have a couple of  good roomie poss=
ibilities
in the works, but since nothing is solidified  yet (and with time ticking),=
 I've
 decided to err on the safe side and  run this one last time:
Looking for a roommate to share a good-sized apartment in a fantastic  Gree=
npoint
location starting March 1.  The place is on Huron St., one  block from the =
G train
and close to all kinds of great things:  Word  bookstore, the waterfront, s=
everal
parks, the East River Ferry, and a  good selection of food options includin=
g several
grocery stores,  restaurants, cafes, a farmer's market at McCarren Park and=
 the=20
Eagle St.  Rooftop Farm in the summer.
For $878 a month (plus utilities/internet - about $55 a month) you get 2  p=
rivate
rooms - great for a bedroom plus home office, studio, sitting  room, giant =
walk=20
in closet, etc.  You also get a small closet in the  main hallway and we sh=
are a
 bathroom and kitchen/lounge that includes  tables and a futon couch.  All =
rooms
 have windows and get a good amount  of light.
I'm an artist, musician and freelance/adjunct educator, and spent  several =
years
 working in documentary film as well.  I usually teach  during the morning/=
early
 afternoon and then spend the late afternoon  working from home or at my ne=
arby=20
studio (with my hands full of clay).   I've lived here for a long while (mo=
ved here
in 1999 when I was 27, so  you can do the math!), love the place and the ne=
ighborhood,
have a good  relationship with the landlords and have had several great roo=
mmates
 over the years.  The place is set up for a lot of privacy (something I  ne=
ed),=20
but I also enjoy sharing a home and having someone around to say  hello to.
I'm queer and prefer living with other queer folk or straight girls.  On  t=
he messy
to clean spectrum I'm well on the clean side and get along  best with someo=
ne who
shares this desire to keep a clean and orderly  home (basically, this means=
 I need
to live with someone who always  cleans up after themselves -- someone who =
wouldn't
think of leaving  dirty dishes in the sink, but of course wipes up stray fo=
od from
the  table after eating, is more than happy to do their fair share of the  =
cleaning
-- you get the picture!).  Since I work from home most  afternoons, I'd pre=
fer to
live with someone who has a day job or some  such engagement during the day=
.  Also,
at this point in my life I prefer  to mix things up by having a new roommat=
e every
year or so (till the  day when I won't have need for a roommate anymore) wh=
ich means
I'm  looking for someone who wants about a year's commitment, with the  pos=
sibility
of staying on a little longer.  Heads up, the place is  fairly quiet in the=
 winter,
but we get lots of ambient noise during the  spring/summer with two outdoor=
 cafes
nearby, so this is not a good fit  for a light sleeper.  And sorry, but no =
smoking,
drugs or pets.
Overall, I'm looking for a new roommate who is friendly, responsible,  laid=
 back,
kind, and easy to live with (and I try to be the same!).
If interested, please send me a little info about yourself (and I  apologiz=
e in=20
advance for not being able to respond to everyone).  I'll  be inviting a fe=
w people
to visit during the weekend in order to see the  place and to feel out if w=
e have
good roommate chemistry.

$850 per month, Park Slope, 12' X 8 1/2', Small sun drenched room in cozy a=
pt  in
heart of the area
Available: March 1 through open ended
Room is in the 2nd floor apartment of a two story house on 12th Street  nea=
r 7th
 Avenue, Park Slope. It is 12 X 8 =BD, has a window overlooking a  garden, =
is sun-filled
and very quiet.  Rent is $850.00 per month, W-Fi  included. Utilities are $=
30.00
 per month.
The room is big enough for a queen size bed, dresser and chair..or a  twin =
bed which
would then allow room for a small desk as well.  There is  a clothes closet=
 with
 a storage shelf in the private upstairs landing  which would be for the ex=
clusive
use of the roommate. There is also room  for storing a bicycle in an empty =
space
 adjoining the stairwell.  The  room is being rented unfurnished, however I=
 would
consider providing  some furniture if necessary. Also I have a queen or twi=
n size
airbed  that I can provide temporarily, but it would not be a long term  so=
lution...these
beds tend to leak air after long term use.
The apartment itself is 600 sf and is newly renovated, with an all new  kit=
chen,
 bathroom, refinished hardwood floors, and beautiful new paint  job. It is =
two small
flights up from street level.
Although the apartment is a one bedroom, I am using it as a two bedroom  (t=
he "living
room" being the 2nd bedroom). The bedrooms are private,  with doors, and si=
tuated
on either side of the large kitchen which  includes a small common area wit=
h a table
and chairs.  The entrance to  the apartment opens into the kitchen.
Re the Kitchen: It is dream for someone who likes to cook..brand new 5  bur=
ner range
and stove, giant new refrigerator, and new very spacious  cabinets. It is f=
ully=20
outfitted with kitchen stuff like dishes, pots,  pans, knives, forks, cups,=
 bowls,
blender, toaster, etc.,  and a  cappuccino machine.
The bathroom is shared and is situated one window away from the room for  r=
ent,=20
so is very convenient for a roommate. The bathroom has a window,  gets lots=
 of light,
and has a very large bathtub and shower.
The apartment is also home to two friendly cats which basically stay in  my=
 room
 unless invited out by the roommate.  If you have a cat that you  would lik=
e to=20
bring with you that is negotiable, although I would prefer  not having any =
more=20
animals in the apt.
Note:* The apartment and entire building is a No-Smoking environment. So  i=
f you
 smoke you would have to do it outside of the building.
Room is available starting March 1, but could be available sooner if  neces=
sary.
 My current roommate is moving out to start living with her  boyfriend and =
would
 be glad to vacate earlier than March 1. To move in  you will need first mo=
nth's
 rent in advance plus one month's rent as  Security Deposit.
About me:
Photographer, male, 70's, work in the arts, hang out with artists and  acad=
emics.
Spend very little time at home, mostly working in my studio,  or out with f=
riends.
When I'm home I like the space to be a respite from  the somewhat hectic li=
fe I=20
lead outside of it, and would hope that a  roommate would have that same fe=
eling
 about their living space.
About you:
Somehow connected to the arts, able to pay the rent on time, reasonably  ne=
at, considerate
of others, done with your partying days, or if not, at  least not into brin=
ging=20
the party home.
It would be nice if we had enough in common so that when we pass each  othe=
r coming
in or out, or happen to be in the common space at the same  time, we might =
engage
in some interesting bits of conversation, but that  would be a plus, not a =
necessity.
The neighborhood is full of great restaurants, bars, cafes, shops of  every=
 description,
Park Slope Food Coop and other food stores, &  many laundromats, Zipcar gar=
age down
the street, F & B trains a  block away, and the R a five minute walk; Two b=
locks
 from the 5th Ave  bus line, =BD block from the 7th Ave bus lines, 4 blocks=
 to a YMCA
with a  great pool, and Yoga all over the place.

$775 per month, Bushwick, Large, windowey room available/ 1br in a 2br apar=
tment
Available: February 12, 2013 through April 2014
The room is large, has two big windows, wood floors, and a private  entranc=
e. It's
a railroad-style apartment, but there's a window in every  room.  Besides t=
he two
bedrooms, there's a kitchen, a bath, and a small  communal room.  The kitch=
en and
the back room look out onto a big tree,  a garden space, and a bird feeder.
The Dekalb L stop is a block-and-a-half away, as is the laundry and the  gr=
ocery.
 Otherwise, the area itself is growing fast and there are  restaurants, bar=
s, and
coffee shops all over the place--there's even a  new used books store (Mola=
sses=20
Books) down the street.  Maria Hernandez  Park is just around the corner an=
d boasts
a great running track and a  new dog area. It's a great, convenient place t=
o live.
I am a 24-year-old artist.  I work in a screen printing studio four days  a=
 week
 and otherwise am involved with my own projects at home.  Really,  what I'm=
 looking
for is to lead an easy, responsible, respectful  existence with my roommate=
.  I'm
pretty easy going; I cook often, have  friends over for cards once-in-a-whi=
le, and
love to be outdoors.  Small  dogs are welcome, but I'm allergic to cats.

$1540 per month, East Village, 500 sq ft, Lovely mosaic building, quiet apa=
rtment
in an awesome area
Available: Immediate through Mid August
Background
I'm moving just up the street into an apartment with my best friend from  c=
ollege
(yay!) so I'm looking someone to sublet my room from around  February 15 to=
 mid-August.
 The apartment was newly renovated when we  moved in 6 months ago. My roomm=
ate and
I are rarely at home so the place  hasn't really been lived in much at all.=
 The=20
apartment is fully  furnished. The bed-room is fully furnished as well, I c=
an even
leave my  recently bought a new bed and desk from Ikea last week.
Features
Great kitchen:
- Black marble floor
- Gas Stove
- Lots of cabinets and natural lighting
Living room:
- Great natural lighting
- Awesomely comfy sofa!
-  Nice set up to chill after work and have breakfast in the morning
-   Internet and utilities already set up
Bedroom:
- A newly furnished room with a full-size bed from Ikea
- Lots of storage space in the closet
Local Attractions:
- 3 blocks from a Latin American supermarket (great foods you cannot find e=
asy at
the other markets)
- 15 minute walk from Chinatown
- The conventional grocery store is around the block and there are two  Lau=
ndromats
and dry-cleaners on the same block (one of them is organic)
- There's also a gym on the same block
-  Lots of great restaurants less than 5 minutes away
- 3 streets up from Houston and LES,
-  Katz Delicatessen
Your New Roommate!:
My roommate is a consultant. He's a great guy, very respectful and  clean. =
He travels
a lot for work during the week so he's usually only  back in NYC on some of=
 the=20
weekends so you pretty much have the whole  apartment to yourself most of t=
he time.
About me:
I'm an engineer, turned potter, turned consultant. Hoping to get back to
pottery someday :), but now management consulting is paying the bills.
I fell in love with this apartment because it is very well maintained, has =
great
 character, and has an amazing landlady.
I pay $1540 for it but can flexible with the price a bit. Please let me  kn=
ow if
 you may be interested!! I look forward to talking to you.

$900 per month, Harlem, 150 sq ft, Central Park Sublet
Available: April 3 through TBD
Hi, I am a bit of a regular on Stephanie's list, and have always been  than=
kful=20
for the wonderful people her project has sent me to rent my  lovely furnish=
ed apartment.
For this time around I will be going away for 6 weeks to Asia for a  projec=
t and
 am looking for a quiet, clean and respectful roommate for a  short term su=
blet=20
that has the potential to become a longer term rental.
From April 3 to May 18 I will be subletting my furnished bedroom for  $900 =
a month.
It is the smaller bedroom of a real 800 sq ft two bedroom  apartment in a b=
rand=20
new elevator building. The larger master bedroom is  currently being rented=
 by a
 lovely young musical couple from Spain who  will be in the apartment until=
 May=20
11. Once they leave to go back to  Spain for the summer, their furnished be=
droom
 will be available to rent  for a longer period of time. This means the ren=
t would
change to $1,200 a  month.
The rent includes all utilities and internet, shared bathroom and a  fully =
stocked
kitchen (tend to try to keep it close to vegetarian with  just chicken or f=
ish.)
 Both rooms are furnished with a bed, chairs,  storage shelves, a closet, s=
heets,
towels and blankets. My smaller room  has a murphy bed that can be raised t=
o allow
space for working at a desk  or practicing yoga. The Master bedroom has a b=
ed that
can fold up into a  couch, a desk, a few smaller tables and a wonderful ant=
ique=20
dining  table for eating in.
While I am away the living room will be available to share with a dining  t=
able,
 desks and couch. When I return in May I use the living room as  my office/=
studio
when I work at home. I have a lot of plants, so while I  am away I hope you=
 can=20
help me take care of them.  I would leave  detailed watering instructions.
I am on the second floor facing north on a quiet residential street with  t=
ree top
views, AC, WiFi, hard wood floors and good clean neighbors,  very safe. Ala=
s there
is no laundry in the building, but plenty of  Laundromats around the corner=
, as=20
well as 2 major subway stops, nice  supermarket and lots of cool restaurant=
s and
 bars nearby. The best part  is only being 2 blocks north of Central Park!

$570 per month, Astoria, Queens, 15' x 8.5', One Room Sublet in 4-Bedroom A=
partment
Available: 4/1/13 through 8/31/13
I work in Client Services at Ticketmaster and I'm relocating my position  t=
o North
Carolina at the end of March.  I'm looking for someone bright  and responsi=
ble to
take over the remainder of my lease, which I share  with my 3 roommates - a=
n artist,
a law student, and a journalism  graduate student.
Our apartment is located in Astoria, a cozy, residential neighborhood of  Q=
ueens,
which over the past few years has attracted a large number of  young people=
 seeking
an inexpensive, lively community that is easily  accessible to Manhattan.
The entire apartment is 1200 square feet, and includes, in addition to 4  b=
edrooms,
a living room, kitchen, sunroom (which we use mostly for  storage), and a b=
athroom.
 You can walk home on Ditmars Blvd, a busy  street with numerous grocery st=
ores,
 restaurants, and small shops.   There's a large Greek population in Astori=
a so=20
you'll find lots of  excellent Greek food.  We're also about a 15-20 minute=
 walk
 from Little  Egypt.
Heat is included, but electricity is not.  Per person it usually ends up  b=
eing=20
around $30-$40, but in the summer can be higher because of window  air cond=
itioners.
 Internet + basic cable is $11 per person.  We buy  household goods every 2=
 months
in bulk from Costco and split the cost -  ends up usually being about $10 p=
er person.
 We also rotate cleaning  chores on a weekly basis.  I'm very fond of my ro=
ommates
(2 girls, 1  guy).  They are clean, fun, and hospitable people, each accomp=
lished
in  his or her own right.  I'll miss them a lot.  You should definitely be =
a  team
player if you'd like to live here!

$650 per month, Long Island City, About 12' by 20', It's huge, cheap,  conv=
enient,
and you get to take care of my cats for the month.
Available: February 28th through March 31st
Hi,
I'm a scientist and musician and writer.  I'm looking to sublet my  bedroom=
 in Long
Island City for the month of March.  It's an extremely  large room in a two=
 bedroom
basement apartment, comfortable and livable  and large, and convenient to M=
anhattan.
 It's in a quiet and safe area,  five minutes walk from the E, M, 7, and G =
trains
and 10 minutes walk  from the F, N, and Q lines.  There is a beautiful view=
 of the
city from  the rooftop (the building is only two stories, but all the other=
  buildings
around here are even shorter), a rooftop which is big, easily  accessible, =
and best
of all, mostly unused by anybody except me (and now  you!).  You will be sh=
aring
 the apartment with a metal worker /  sculptor, nice guy, quiet, cool, won'=
t get
 in your hair about much of  anything.  The room is easily big enough to sl=
eep in
and use as a studio  as well.
I pay $900 a month for the room; I'm only asking $650, because I want  the =
subletter
to take care of my two cats during that period.  The cats  are nice, cute o=
ne very
friendly the other rather shy but sweet too.  It  takes about two minutes a=
 day=20
of effort to take care of cats.
Price is somewhat negotiable.  Let me know if you are interested!
Best,
Peter Insley

Hello there,
I'm a 30-year-old SF to Brooklyn transplant trying to get on my feet.   I'v=

Barter, Park Slope/Gowanus - Atlantic Subway, Pilates/Yoga/Massage/BodyWork
Hello Barter-Friendly Body Workers -
I have a professional quality Pilates Machine and would like to be  trained=
 to use
it properly. It's an older model wooden Reformer (with  box, springs and ba=
r) but
has all the pieces and is very solid.
I'm in search of an instructor who's familiar with this particular  machine=
 (see
 photo) and would be interested in a mutually beneficial  barter/partial ba=
rter=20
arrangement. (Perhaps bartering use of the space  and machine with your per=
sonal
 clients in exchange for training me).
I also have a small in-home studio space in Brooklyn  (near the  Atlantic/B=
arclays
Station) with space & equipment for a variety of  healing modalities. I am =
eager
 to get back to optimal health and would  be interested in working out a si=
milar
 arrangement with other body  workers & healers.
If you have personal clients but don't want to spend money renting your  ow=
n space
- please consider calling - I'm open to all sorts of  interesting ideas!
And if you are seeking a much larger space for something really  ambitious =
I'd be
happy to show you the 1,000sq ft event space below me.
Lets make something healthy happen!!
Many Thanks & Blessings,
Linda

e: Feb. 15, 2013 through Dec. 31, 2013<br /><br /> I'm currently looking fo=
r a person or persons to occupy a 300 sq ft  portion of a larger studio. A =
wall runs the length of the 600 sf studio  and divides it.  It has large wi=
ndows, lots of light, and a slop sink.   It is available immediately for a =
period of 6-11 months with the  possibility to renew after one year.  The b=
uilding is located at 1717  Troutman off of the Jefferson L stop. I've atta=
ched a few photos of the  studio which is currently occupied and a photo of=
 the building's rooftop  with good views of the city.<br /><br /> <a style=

0 per month, Bed Stuy, 10x8 feet, Cozy sunlit room with a beautiful view<br=
 /> Available: starting February 20 through open ended<br /><br /> My name =
is Jeanne and I recently moved from San Francisco to NY. I found  a beautif=
ul 2 br apartment in a 1930's building in the heart of Bed  Stuy and I'm lo=
oking for a like-minded roommate (male or female) to  share it with me.<br =
/> I am a 31 year old film editor/assistant editor and often work from  hom=
e so I would like to live with someone who has a day job/classes  during th=
e day. I am looking for a mellow, respectful person who wants a  clean and =
calm household. I am friendly and social and hope to live  with someone who=
 I really get along with, but I tend to be on the quiet  side when I'm home=
. I have a great group of friends and family here so  am out most nights fo=
r dinners, movies, plays and shows but like to come  home to a quiet haven =
where I can be in bed by midnight on weeknights!<br /> <br /> The room:<br =
/> <br /> The room is on the small side, but has a large window with pretty=
  moulding and a fire escape for enjoying the warm summer nights. There is =
 no closet in the room (you would need a dresser or armoire) but there  is =
some space available to hang clothes in the hall closet.<br /> <br /> The a=
partment:<br /> <br /> Please note: since the pictures were taken I painted=
 the bathroom blue  and put up shelves in the living room. The apartment is=
 fully furnished  (furniture is still being shipped from CA so isn't in pic=
tures..living  room will have a nice wooden dining room table, record playe=
r and couch -  no TV!) so please plan to bring your bedroom furniture and s=
ome kitchen  stuff if you have that, but unfortunately there isn't room for=
 any more  furniture in the living room.<br /> The building is clean and pr=
etty, with 1930's details and the apartment  itself feels like a little jew=
el box - hardwood floors, nice bathroom  and new appliances in the kitchen.=
 It's on the fourth floor and there's a  great view of the Manhattan skylin=
e.<br /> The kitchen is quite small so if you are really into cooking this =
may  be frustrating for you. I have come up with a few ingenious ways to ma=
ke  cooking easier with the limited space (big cutting board over the sink =
 makes more counter space..) but I only cook a couple of times a week  (and=
 by cook I mean boil water and toss something in) so I am happy with  the m=
inimalist kitchen! <br /> <br /> The location:<br /> <br /> The location is=
 great: it's right on Lewis near the Stuyvesant Heights  historical distric=
t. Peaches and Saraghina restaurants, 24 hour organic  grocery store, multi=
ple delis, beautiful little library, Therapy wine  bar and more restaurants=
/cafes are all close by. 10 min walk to A  express train to Manhattan (A/C =
at Utica and C at Kingston/Throop) or 15  minute walk to the M stop at Gate=
s. The A/C also connects to the G in 2  stops @ Hoyt-Schemerhorn (or B52 bu=
s drops off near the G). The J/M/Z  and L connect one stop away at Broadway=
 Junction.<br /><br /> <a style=3D"color: black;" shape=3D"rect" href=3D"ht=

ent<br /> Available: March 1 through ongoing<br /><br /> Come live in my be=
autiful Bushwick apartment!  The corner bedroom has  opened up for a new ro=
ommate from March 1-onward.  It's bright, sunny (4  windows), BIG (used to =
be the living room ages ago), so bring your  king-sized bed - it will fit -=
 and has a new closet.  The apartment  itself was "spruced up" in October: =
new drywall, new fixtures, new  closet doors, refinished floors, new fixtur=
es in the bathroom, and a  completely redone kitchen.  It's just adorable. =
 And we have a  washer-dryer unit. It's a corner unit, so it gets lots of l=
ight, stays  relatively cool in the summer, and my landlord is NOT stingy w=
ith the  heat, so we are toasty from November-April. The neighborhood is tr=
endy,  and on the up-and-up: we're blocks from Northeast Kingdom, 1 block f=
rom  Hana, across the street from Pearl's, and there are about 4 other bars=
  in the 4 block radius, plus a new juice bar, a few coffee shops, and  Bat=
haus coworking space across the street. 1 Block from the train.   Literally=
. And we have an awesome building super - very attentive, and  very friendl=
y.<br /> <br /> Photos are of the bedroom, only - and the room will be unfu=
rnished.  The  bed in the photos is a full-size bed, to give you an idea of=
 the size  of the room.<br /> <br /> About me: I split my time between my m=
usic and art: I teach violin,  perform on the weekends, and am at my studio=
 playing with clay when I'm  not doing one of those.  I do my socializing o=
utside of the home, and I  chill at the apartment.  Once in a blue moon, I'=
ll have a friend over  for drinks or dinner. My schedule varies, and I use =
the apartment as my  space to recharge before attacking the next thing for =
the day.  It's my  home.  <br /> <br /> A few rules: if you can't jive with=
 these, we won't get along, and I wish you luck elsewhere:<br /> 1) NO DRUG=
S, NO DRUG DEALING, NO FUNNY STUFF. Period.  But you can smoke  cigarettes =
out your window (I do) or on the fire escape.<br /> 2) No revolving door of=
 hook-ups, one-night stands, friends-from-afar,  and distant relations.  Th=
is is a home, not a hotel. NB: guests are cool  on a case-by-case basis, af=
ter discussion of length of stay, etc.  More  on that topic in person.<br /=
> 3) No pets. :( Landlord said so.  But service animals are fine.  <br /> <=
br /> So, all I know about you is that: 1) you're employed 2) work outside =
of  the home 3) and are a communicative, peaceful, non-passive-aggressive  =
individual.  If you're interested in the place, tell me me more about  your=
self, what you do, how you spend your time, and your idea of a home.   If y=
ou can jive with the above, you have a couch, and you know who  Augustine, =
Clive Staples Lewis, Gilbert Keith Chesterton, J.P. Moreland  and Tommy Peo=
ples are, (one of these things is not like the others)...  we'll get along =
fine.  Shoot me an email to set up a time to see the  rest of the apt, and =
for me to figure out who you are.<br /><br /> <a style=3D"color: black;" sh=

 Apartment:<br /> A fully furnished, 950 sq. ft., 3-bedroom apartment with =
12 ft.  ceilings, smack dab between the Montrose and Morgan stops off the L=
. We  have a dishwasher AND laundry in the building (I know!). Lots to do i=

ts, venues, flea markets, kind of grimy parks. 5-minute walk to  the train,=
 and a 20-minute ride to Union Sq.<br /> <br /> The Room:<br /> Modestly si=
zed at approx. 8x15ft, but tall ceilings and 9-foot  wall-to-wall windows m=
ake it feel much bigger. Room has a ceiling fan,  as well as individually c=
ontrolled AC and heat. Unless you have a ton of  stuff (in which case you p=
robably aren't the ideal roommate for us),  you should fit very comfortably=
. Rent is 850 dollars a month and  includes gas, electric, water, cable int=
ernet and a bi-weekly cleaning  lady (she's awesome).<br /> <br /> The Room=
mates:<br /> There are three of us -- all in our middish/late 20s. A couple=
 in the  big room (Him: a high school teacher. Her: a copywriter), and one =
other  dude (does fancy things for the Department of Education) in a room  =
approx. the same size as yours. <br /> <br /> We like each other a bunch, a=
nd would like to keep the current open,  considerate, and tidy environment =
going strong. We all have big kid  jobs, but our hours are slightly stagger=
ed, so sometimes we will go for a  few days without seeing each other. We d=
o not really party in the house  (though we are all social drinkers/ nonsmo=
kers) but we do occasionally  have roof parties (the roof is GINORMOUS). <b=
r /> <br /> You:<br /> You do you - as long as you are nice, and not dumb, =
or too noisy, and  can respect other people's boundaries. People who like b=
ooks and sports  and art and math and .gifs and food and beer and wine are =
especially  encouraged to apply. We're all generally out of the house betwe=
en 7am  and 7pm, so it would be nice if you kept a similar schedule (althou=
gh we  all share a bathroom, so ideally you aren't a super early riser). <b=
r /> <br /> The Rent:<br /> You will need first, last and one month securit=
y to move in (First  roommate test: 850 dollars times 3) Rent is due on the=
 first of the  month and includes gas, electric, water, cable internet and =
a bi-weekly  cleaning lady (again, she's awesome).<br /> <br /> Please emai=

0 per month, Chinatown/ LES, Looking for someone to share this newly renova=
ted apt with me and my pup in Chinatown<br /> Available: End of Feb through=
 1 year<br /><br /> About me: I'm 23, queer, female with an adorable corgi =
named Monty.  Obviously, you would need to be okay with these facts.I like =
to keep a  clean home- especially the kitchen/dishes stuff. Also, I would p=
refer to  keep a no-shoes house (yeah, I even wipe Monty's feet at the door=
)  cause there is some nasty stuff going on in the streets and you know  th=
at. Other than that, I'm super sociable and outgoing, I love to  cook/bake =
and eat (mostly veg though).<br /> <br /> About you:<br /> Male or Female, =
dog and lgbtq friendly. Not passive aggressive or a  hermit that treats me =
like an oddity.We don't have to be BFF, but being  friendly would be a plus=
 since no one likes being uncomfortable in their  own home right? You alway=
s clean up after yourself. And give me a  warning when you bring someone ov=
er. We can throw small get-togethers  and dinner parties on our huge terrac=
e this summer. If I can have  friends crash on our couch once in a while, s=
o can you. Respectful and  quiet during sleepy time though.<br /> <br /> La=
st but not least, you have 3x the monthly rent (2 months for the  security =
deposit and the rent for March). The total cost depends if you  choose to t=
ake the private room or the partitioned living room.<br /> <br /> About the=
 Apt/Building<br /> The building has 24 hour security and cameras on every =
floor and angle.  There is a coin laundry in the basement they are updating=
 in June and an  elevator so no need to schlep. The apt is on the 2nd floor=
 with direct  access to the HUGENORMOUS terrace that wraps around the build=
ing (only 4  apts have direct access like us, plus one public door). It's a=
 one  bedroom apartment that was recently renovated, wood floors, open and =
 sunny, plus we control the heat/ac. The unfurnished bedroom I am renting  =
out is 12ft by 11ft with a closet 6ft wide and 3ft deep for $1150. OR  you =
can take the partitioned living room for $900, but I would need some  acces=
s to the patio doors so Monty and I don't trample on you. The  kitchen has =
new granite counter tops and cabinets. I want to to leave a  portion of the=
 living room for a couch/coffee table as a communal space.  The total rent =
we are splitting is $2050/month with heat and water  included, no fee. We h=
ave to pay for AC/electricity and internet.<br /><br /> <a style=3D"color: =

8 per month, Greenpoint, 10'x9'7, 2 private rooms available - fantastic loc=
ation<br /> Available: March 1<br /><br /> Hello!  A quick preface to my li=
sting.  I ran this last week and had a  big response.  I was able to meet w=
ith a few folks and have a couple of  good roomie possibilities in the work=
s, but since nothing is solidified  yet (and with time ticking), I've decid=
ed to err on the safe side and  run this one last time: <br /> <br /> Looki=
ng for a roommate to share a good-sized apartment in a fantastic  Greenpoin=
t location starting March 1.  The place is on Huron St., one  block from th=
e G train and close to all kinds of great things:  Word  bookstore, the wat=
erfront, several parks, the East River Ferry, and a  good selection of food=
 options including several grocery stores,  restaurants, cafes, a farmer's =
market at McCarren Park and the Eagle St.  Rooftop Farm in the summer.<br /=
> <br /> For $878 a month (plus utilities/internet - about $55 a month) you=
 get 2  private rooms - great for a bedroom plus home office, studio, sitti=
ng  room, giant walk in closet, etc.  You also get a small closet in the  m=
ain hallway and we share a bathroom and kitchen/lounge that includes  table=
s and a futon couch.  All rooms have windows and get a good amount  of ligh=
t.  <br /> <br /> I'm an artist, musician and freelance/adjunct educator, a=
nd spent  several years working in documentary film as well.  I usually tea=
ch  during the morning/early afternoon and then spend the late afternoon  w=
orking from home or at my nearby studio (with my hands full of clay).   I'v=
e lived here for a long while (moved here in 1999 when I was 27, so  you ca=
n do the math!), love the place and the neighborhood, have a good  relation=
ship with the landlords and have had several great roommates  over the year=
s.  The place is set up for a lot of privacy (something I  need), but I als=
o enjoy sharing a home and having someone around to say  hello to. <br /> <=
br /> I'm queer and prefer living with other queer folk or straight girls. =
 On  the messy to clean spectrum I'm well on the clean side and get along  =
best with someone who shares this desire to keep a clean and orderly  home =
(basically, this means I need to live with someone who always  cleans up af=
ter themselves -- someone who wouldn't think of leaving  dirty dishes in th=
e sink, but of course wipes up stray food from the  table after eating, is =
more than happy to do their fair share of the  cleaning -- you get the pict=
ure!).  Since I work from home most  afternoons, I'd prefer to live with so=
meone who has a day job or some  such engagement during the day.  Also, at =
this point in my life I prefer  to mix things up by having a new roommate e=
very year or so (till the  day when I won't have need for a roommate anymor=
e) which means I'm  looking for someone who wants about a year's commitment=
, with the  possibility of staying on a little longer.  Heads up, the place=
 is  fairly quiet in the winter, but we get lots of ambient noise during th=
e  spring/summer with two outdoor cafes nearby, so this is not a good fit  =
for a light sleeper.  And sorry, but no smoking, drugs or pets.  <br /> <br=
 /> Overall, I'm looking for a new roommate who is friendly, responsible,  =
laid back, kind, and easy to live with (and I try to be the same!). <br /> =
<br /> If interested, please send me a little info about yourself (and I  a=
pologize in advance for not being able to respond to everyone).  I'll  be i=
nviting a few people to visit during the weekend in order to see the  place=
 and to feel out if we have good roommate chemistry.<br /><br /> <a style=

 for a queen size bed, dresser and chair..or a  twin bed which would then a=

age shelf in the private upstairs landing  which would be for the exclusive=
 use of the roommate. There is also room  for storing a bicycle in an empty=
 space adjoining the stairwell.  The  room is being rented unfurnished, how=

 queen or twin size airbed  that I can provide temporarily, but it would no=

 an all new  kitchen, bathroom, refinished hardwood floors, and beautiful n=

Although the apartment is a one bedroom, I am using it as a two bedroom  (t=
he "living room" being the 2nd bedroom). The bedrooms are private,  with do=
ors, and situated on either side of the large kitchen which  includes a sma=
ll common area with a table and chairs.  The entrance to  the apartment ope=
ns into the kitchen. <br /> <br /> Re the Kitchen: It is dream for someone =
who likes to cook..brand new 5  burner range and stove, giant new refrigera=
tor, and new very spacious  cabinets. It is fully outfitted with kitchen st=
uff like dishes, pots,  pans, knives, forks, cups, bowls, blender, toaster,=
 etc.,  and a  cappuccino machine. <br /> <br /> The bathroom is shared and=
 is situated one window away from the room for  rent, so is very convenient=
 for a roommate. The bathroom has a window,  gets lots of light, and has a =
very large bathtub and shower.<br /> <br /> The apartment is also home to t=
wo friendly cats which basically stay in  my room unless invited out by the=
 roommate.  If you have a cat that you  would like to bring with you that i=
s negotiable, although I would prefer  not having any more animals in the a=
pt. <br /> <br /> Note:* The apartment and entire building is a No-Smoking =
environment. So  if you smoke you would have to do it outside of the buildi=
ng. <br /> <br /> Room is available starting March 1, but could be availabl=
e sooner if  necessary. My current roommate is moving out to start living w=
ith her  boyfriend and would be glad to vacate earlier than March 1. To mov=
e in  you will need first month's rent in advance plus one month's rent as =
 Security Deposit. <br /> <br /> About me: <br /> Photographer, male, 70's,=
 work in the arts, hang out with artists and  academics. Spend very little =
time at home, mostly working in my studio,  or out with friends. When I'm h=
ome I like the space to be a respite from  the somewhat hectic life I lead =
outside of it, and would hope that a  roommate would have that same feeling=
 about their living space. <br /> <br /> About you:<br /> Somehow connected=
 to the arts, able to pay the rent on time, reasonably  neat, considerate o=
f others, done with your partying days, or if not, at  least not into bring=
ing the party home. <br /> <br /> It would be nice if we had enough in comm=
on so that when we pass each  other coming in or out, or happen to be in th=
e common space at the same  time, we might engage in some interesting bits =
of conversation, but that  would be a plus, not a necessity. <br /> <br /> =

br /> Background<br /> I'm moving just up the street into an apartment with=
 my best friend from  college (yay!) so I'm looking someone to sublet my ro=
om from around  February 15 to mid-August.  The apartment was newly renovat=
ed when we  moved in 6 months ago. My roommate and I are rarely at home so =
the place  hasn't really been lived in much at all. The apartment is fully =
 furnished. The bed-room is fully furnished as well, I can even leave my  r=
ecently bought a new bed and desk from Ikea last week.  <br /> <br /> Featu=
res<br /> Great kitchen:<br /> - Black marble floor<br /> - Gas Stove<br />=

Great natural lighting<br /> - Awesomely comfy sofa! <br /> -  Nice set up =
to chill after work and have breakfast in the morning<br /> -   Internet an=
d utilities already set up<br /> <br /> Bedroom:<br /> - A newly furnished =
room with a full-size bed from Ikea<br /> - Lots of storage space in the cl=
oset<br /> <br /> Local Attractions:<br /> - 3 blocks from a Latin American=
 supermarket (great foods you cannot find easy at the other markets)<br /> =
- 15 minute walk from Chinatown<br /> - The conventional grocery store is a=
round the block and there are two  Laundromats and dry-cleaners on the same=
 block (one of them is organic)<br /> - There's also a gym on the same bloc=
k  <br /> -  Lots of great restaurants less than 5 minutes away<br /> - 3 s=
treets up from Houston and LES,<br /> -  Katz Delicatessen<br /> <br /> You=
r New Roommate!:  <br /> My roommate is a consultant. He's a great guy, ver=
y respectful and  clean. He travels a lot for work during the week so he's =
usually only  back in NYC on some of the weekends so you pretty much have t=
he whole  apartment to yourself most of the time. <br /> <br /> About me: <=
br /> I'm an engineer, turned potter, turned consultant. Hoping to get back=
 to <br /> pottery someday :), but now management consulting is paying the =
bills. <br /> <br /> I fell in love with this apartment because it is very =
well maintained, has great character, and has an amazing landlady.<br /> <b=
r /> I pay $1540 for it but can flexible with the price a bit. Please let m=

3 through TBD<br /><br /> Hi, I am a bit of a regular on Stephanie's list, =
and have always been  thankful for the wonderful people her project has sen=
t me to rent my  lovely furnished apartment.<br /> <br /> For this time aro=
und I will be going away for 6 weeks to Asia for a  project and am looking =
for a quiet, clean and respectful roommate for a  short term sublet that ha=
s the potential to become a longer term rental.  <br /> <br /> From April 3=
 to May 18 I will be subletting my furnished bedroom for  $900 a month. It =
is the smaller bedroom of a real 800 sq ft two bedroom  apartment in a bran=
d new elevator building. The larger master bedroom is  currently being rent=
ed by a lovely young musical couple from Spain who  will be in the apartmen=
t until May 11. Once they leave to go back to  Spain for the summer, their =
furnished bedroom will be available to rent  for a longer period of time. T=
his means the rent would change to $1,200 a  month.<br /> <br /> The rent i=
ncludes all utilities and internet, shared bathroom and a  fully stocked ki=
tchen (tend to try to keep it close to vegetarian with  just chicken or fis=
h.) Both rooms are furnished with a bed, chairs,  storage shelves, a closet=
, sheets, towels and blankets. My smaller room  has a murphy bed that can b=
e raised to allow space for working at a desk  or practicing yoga. The Mast=
er bedroom has a bed that can fold up into a  couch, a desk, a few smaller =
tables and a wonderful antique dining  table for eating in. <br /> <br /> W=
hile I am away the living room will be available to share with a dining  ta=
ble, desks and couch. When I return in May I use the living room as  my off=
ice/studio when I work at home. I have a lot of plants, so while I  am away=
 I hope you can help me take care of them.  I would leave  detailed waterin=
g instructions.<br /> <br /> I am on the second floor facing north on a qui=
et residential street with  tree top views, AC, WiFi, hard wood floors and =
good clean neighbors,  very safe. Alas there is no laundry in the building,=
 but plenty of  Laundromats around the corner, as well as 2 major subway st=
ops, nice  supermarket and lots of cool restaurants and bars nearby. The be=
st part  is only being 2 blocks north of Central Park!<br /><br /> <a style=

ke over the remainder of my lease, which I share  with my 3 roommates - an =
artist, a law student, and a journalism  graduate student.<br /> <br /> Our=
 apartment is located in Astoria, a cozy, residential neighborhood of  Quee=
ns, which over the past few years has attracted a large number of  young pe=
ople seeking an inexpensive, lively community that is easily  accessible to=
 Manhattan.<br /> <br /> The entire apartment is 1200 square feet, and incl=
udes, in addition to 4  bedrooms, a living room, kitchen, sunroom (which we=
 use mostly for  storage), and a bathroom.  You can walk home on Ditmars Bl=
vd, a busy  street with numerous grocery stores, restaurants, and small sho=
ps.   There's a large Greek population in Astoria so you'll find lots of  e=
xcellent Greek food.  We're also about a 15-20 minute walk from Little  Egy=
pt.<br /> <br /> Heat is included, but electricity is not.  Per person it u=
sually ends up  being around $30-$40, but in the summer can be higher becau=
se of window  air conditioners.  Internet + basic cable is $11 per person. =
 We buy  household goods every 2 months in bulk from Costco and split the c=
ost -  ends up usually being about $10 per person.  We also rotate cleaning=
  chores on a weekly basis.  I'm very fond of my roommates (2 girls, 1  guy=
).  They are clean, fun, and hospitable people, each accomplished in  his o=
r her own right.  I'll miss them a lot.  You should definitely be a  team p=
layer if you'd like to live here!<br /><br /> <a style=3D"color: black;" sh=

 quality Pilates Machine and would like to be  trained to use it properly. =
It's an older model wooden Reformer (with  box, springs and bar) but has al=
l the pieces and is very solid.<br /> <br /> I'm in search of an instructor=
 who's familiar with this particular  machine (see photo) and would be inte=
rested in a mutually beneficial  barter/partial barter arrangement. (Perhap=
s bartering use of the space  and machine with your personal clients in exc=
hange for training me).<br /> <br /> I also have a small in-home studio spa=
ce in Brooklyn  (near the  Atlantic/Barclays Station) with space & equipmen=
t for a variety of  healing modalities. I am eager to get back to optimal h=
ealth and would  be interested in working out a similar arrangement with ot=
her body  workers & healers. <br /> <br /> If you have personal clients but=
 don't want to spend money renting your  own space - please consider callin=
g - I'm open to all sorts of  interesting ideas! <br /> <br /> And if you a=
re seeking a much larger space for something really  ambitious I'd be happy=
 to show you the 1,000sq ft event space below me.<br /> Lets make something=
 healthy happen!!<br /> Many Thanks & Blessings,<br /> Linda<br /><br /> <a=
