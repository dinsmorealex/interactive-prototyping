Listings Project Story of the Week:
My partner and I found an amazing loft apartment in Bushwick on Listings Pr=
oject.
It's unbelievably beautiful and we couldn't be happier with this new space.=
 Our=20
roommate is an artist, like myself, and our interests overlap in many areas=
. She
 has lived there for 13 years and the apartment is designed and filled with=
 great
artwork and furniture, and matched our aesthetic perfectly.
Thanks!
John

$500 per month, Bushwick, 500 sq ft, Beautiful, well maintained, well visit=
ed studio
Available: Dec 4
I'm looking to sublet and share my space to another serious artist. 500 plu=
s $30
 for utilities.
http://www.566johnsonave.com/
Looking for someone short or long term, but ideally you want to stay for  a=
t least
6 months.  The space is in bushwick at "the active space", a  studio that i=
s a fixture
of the open studio trail.  Close to the  jefferson L, be at the heart of th=
e bushwick
scene in a building full of  real artists.  I will be the only one on the l=
ease=20
so you don't have to  worry about that, just need a months notice before yo=
u decide
to move  out.
I'm a painter and I will be putting up a curtain or wall at some point,  th=
e studio
is large, and you will still have a really big space to work  in, as well a=
s a lot
of wall.  There is a window in the studio but it is  on my side, depending =
on what
kind of work you do we may be able to  figure out how to share it.
I'm really laid back and friendly, 30 yr old male, will be in my studio  al=
l the
 time, but will not intrude on your privacy if we separate the  space.  If =
we get
along and our work is compatible I'm open to keeping  the floorplan open an=
d just
sharing the whole space.  Please no one who  makes a lot of dust, does a lo=
t of=20
sanding, etc need apply.  I paint in  oils sometimes and I can't have a lot=
 of airborne
material.
the building has slop sinks, bathrooms, everything you need.

$1100 per month, Astoria, 2 Adjacent Rooms for Rent, Huge Light Bedroom & S=
tudio/Office
in shared 3 bdrm
Available: Dec. 15 through open
Hey artists, musicians, filmmakers, writers, designers and other beautiful =
city=20
folk!
Looking for an easygoing, clean, drama-free roommate in late 20s-early 30s =
to share
my awesome 3 bedroom apartment in Astoria.
The place is huge by NYC standards - it's the first floor of a 2 story  hou=
se with
a large living room, huge eat-in kitchen (with a  dishwasher!), and a large=
 green
backyard with plenty of space for summer  parties. There's room to store a =
bike=20
in the house hallway.  A group of  young, friendly actors live upstairs.
The apartment is in a great area - 5 min from the "Steinway" R, M stop  or =
10 min
walk from the "Broadway" N, Q stop. 15 minutes to Manhattan  and LIC or 30 =
min to
Greenpoint and Williamsburg. There's a 24 hr Duane  Reade on the corner, re=
staurants,
bars, supermarkets, laundromats, gyms  and plenty of shopping all around. T=
he Kaufman
Astoria movie theater is  15 min away.
I'm looking to rent out 2 rooms:
- the bedroom which is bright and very large (16x15.5 ft, there's  currentl=
y a king
size bed, a wardrobe, and 3 dressers in there, with  plenty of space left),=
 with
 2 tall windows facing the street.
- the attached smaller room (10.5x10 ft, perfect for an art  studio/workspa=
ce, office
or a second bedroom) which has a nice sized  closet in it.
I'm a 30 year old artist and freelance translator, so usually I work  from =
home=20
during the day and go out with friends at night. Whatever your  schedule, a=
s long
as we can peacefully coexist, it's all good.
**Allergy disclaimer** you'd be sharing the house with a very sweet, very a=
ffectionate,
fluffy cat named Molly.
The rooms are available from Dec. 15. You'll need first month's rent  plus =
an additional
month's rent for security deposit to move in. Rent is  $1100 for 1 person, =
or $1400
for 2 people. Heat and gas are included in  the rent, and we'd split the mo=
nthly
 electricity and the cable TV &  internet bills. Short and long term rental=
s welcome.
If this sounds like it would work for you, send me a note.

$1575 per month, Fort Greene, Large Room available, Gigantic beautiful room=
 in brownstone
apartment
Available: January 1
I live in a beautiful brownstone in Fort Greene less than a block to the  G=
 train
and a 10 minute walk to the C. The room for rent has a  non-working firepla=
ce, original
details and great light. It's a special  place, and because it's as big as =
a 1 bedroom
apt, there is room to set  up a bedroom and a living room, or a bedroom and=
 a workspace.
The room  is at least 350 square feet, but probably way bigger. It's locate=
d in=20
a  very safe area and close to a lot of great restaurants and bars. The  re=
st of
 the apartment is large with a lot of original details. There is  also a fi=
replace
in the living room.
The room is available January 1. You would be living with me-a 35 year  old=
 female
artist, photography professor and photographer. I have a  studio space outs=
ide of
the apartment where I work, but I do work from  home sometimes. I'm a veget=
arian,
but you don't have to be. Shared  living room, bathroom and kitchen.  Sorry=
 no pets.
Short term stays are ok.
Please email me some information about yourself-what hours you keep,  what =
you do
for a living, etc. and if you are available to come see the  room soon.
The rent is $1,575 plus utilities (which come out to around $50 a month)
You really have to see this apartment to believe it!
I hope to hear from you!

n a great
Prospect Heights/North Slope apartment
Available: immediately through May 2013
The apartment is a lovely two bedroom + office. I am looking for a roommate=

a bedroom and office. It is the third floor of a bright and spacious throug=

 use=20
for the extra room or office or art studio.

Neighborhood: The apartment is on Vanderbilt Ave. and St. Marks. A short wa=
lk to
 Prospect Park, Brooklyn Botanic Gardens and Brooklyn Museum. Easy subway a=
ccess
 -- B,Q at 7th Ave., 2,3 at Grand Army Plaza and C at Clinton-Washington. A=
n easy
30 minute commute to mid-town. The neighborhood is fantastic with plenty of=
 great
restaurants (James, The Vanderbilt, Franny's, Geido, Amorina, and many othe=

not crazy.
I work at home some days and out others, and travel quite a bit for work. W=
hile=20
I have lived in the apartment with two other roommates, I find the space is=
 best
 shared between two. I'm open to 2 people or a couple if it's the right sit=

My current roommate uses the extra room as an office but it could work as a=
 small
art studio as well. Preferably looking for someone through May (option to r=

for the remainder of December. Pretty  much all my furniture budget is tied=
 up with
the full amount of this  month's rent, so the sooner I find a roommate the =
sooner
we can actually  decorate the place.
I'm a novelist with occasional administrative day jobs looking for  someone=
 to take
a new twelve-month lease on my apartment in Crown  Heights. The living room=
 is particularly
spacious and in need of new  d=E9cor -- my old roommate took her stuff, and=
 I gave
 away pretty much all  my belongings when I left California about six month=
s ago.
I have the larger of the two bedrooms in the apartment, and the second  bed=
room=20
is smaller and probably best suited for someone who wants a  peaceful place=
 to come
home to but doesn't have much stuff. Currently, I  don't have pets but a ca=
t or=20
two would be fine. No dogs, sorry.
There's a 24hour bodega on the corner, a half-dozen grocery stores of  vary=
ing quality
nearby, and it's a short walk to Prospect Park and  Brooklyn Museum.  The 3=
-train
is on the corner of the block, and the  Franklin 2/3/4/5 express stop is on=
ly two
blocks away.

all the restaurants, bars, cafes and shops you could  want  at your doorste=
p. Its
a rare find at the right price.
The rent includes all utilities including wifi and a bi monthly maid servic=
e for
 the common areas.
I have used the listings project many times to find flat mates, studio mate=
s and
 sublets and it has always worked out great.
Cheers

amsburg
room with private entrance and bathroom.  Fit for one or a  couple!
Available: December 23rd through January 5th
I am looking to sublet one room in a two bedroom apartment. The cool  thing=
 about
the set-up here is that it's essentially two studio  apartments connected b=
y a kitchen.
You will have your own full bathroom  (shower w/ tub, commode, etc) and a s=
eparate
key entry. The only shared  space is the large kitchen which you will share=
 with
 my roommate.  She  is a lovely up and coming playwright.
The ROOM itself has a peaceful sunny feel, hardwood floors, and comes  full=
y furnished
with a queen size bed, couch, desk, and large closet.   The neighborhood is=
 vibrant
and lovely with new bars, coffeeshops and  restaurants within blocks. Natur=
al organic
food market and laundry  within one block, and a 3-5 minute walk to the Gra=
ham or
the Grand L  stop. A hop skip and step to Mccaren park where you can run ar=
ound=20
the  track or visit the Saturday farmer's market.
$1,400 for two weeks will include rent/utilities/internet and (if you  woul=
d like)
use of my sewing machine, easel, guitar, and large  chalkboard calendar dur=
ing your
stay. I'm asking for a $1000 security  deposit to be reimbursed at the end =
of your
stay and your trust to look  over my lovingly selected thrift store trinket=
s.  Please
also be  prepared to list two references as well as providing a copy of you=
r  passport
or ID.
I'm looking for someone respectful, artist-friendly, tidy, and  non-smoking=
. The
 room is big enough for a couple and perfect if you are  looking to spend s=
ome time
in New York over the holidays.  No parties,  please!   I'm a little flexibl=
e on=20
the price AND DATES so please do  inquire if you are curious.
Happy Holidays!

$1036 per month, Crown Heights, Gigantic Room, Big beautiful room overlooki=

backyard in a 2BR brownstone
Available: January 3rd through March 2nd
Hi! I'm subletting my room for the months of January and February.  It's  a=
 huge,
gorgeous room on the ground floor of a brownstone in Crown  Heights.  The r=
oom used
to be the dining room and has a built-in oak  mantel, built in oak buffet (=
that=20
I use as a dresser), french doors, and  three windows that overlook the apa=
rtment's
semi-private backyard.   It's furnished with a queen-sized bed, desk, comfy=
 chair,
and side  table.
Our block is really safe and quiet.  It's mostly families and people  actua=
lly say
Hi to you when you pass them on the street.  It's off the  2/5 at President=
 or the
3 at Nostrand.  It's a 10 minute walk to  restaurants and bars on Franklin =
Ave,=20
a 20 minute walk to the Brooklyn  Museum, and just a few minutes more to Pr=
ospect
Park.
You would be sharing the apartment with a couple in their late 20s who  mov=
ed here
from Spain last year.  They're very friendly and social and  really into th=
e music
scene.  They're really really good people.  Very  kind, inclusive, and fun.=
  You
 would also be sharing the apartment with  my two sweet and affectionate ca=
ts. =20
My roommates will be taking care of  them while I'm gone, but they'll proba=
bly still
want to come in my  (your) room and sleep on the chair or wherever, so you =
should
be ok with  this.  No other pets.  Sorry :(
The apartment has a huge living space and huge bathroom.  Our landlord live=
s next
door and is great.
The most important thing, for me and my roommates, is that we find  someone=
 who=20
is pleasant and trustworthy.  It's a nice little home we  have here and we'=
d like
to maintain the balance.
Check out the pics, and write me if you would like to come see it.
Other financial stuff: utilities and wifi are included but heat is not.   W=
e haven't
gotten our first bill but we're guessing it will be $75  each.  Also, I'm r=
equiring
that the subletter either pay both months up  front or leave a $500 deposit=
.

she loves
the place. I'm sure they would serve as my  references if you want to email=

Available: 1/14/13 through 8/31/13
I'm subletting my spacious and sun filled apartment because I'm going to  a=
nother
city to take some classes. It has 2 bedrooms - one is much  larger than the=
 other
so it's ideal for a couple or a person who wants  to live and work here but=
 can=20
also be used for 2 roommates. The location  is great! It's equidistant to t=
he Lorimer
L/ Metropolitan G stops and  the J/M Hewes stop (about a 7 minute walk). Th=
e Williamsburg
bridge is  less than a 5 minute bike ride away for those who commute by bik=
e into
 Manhattan. It's around the corner from Union & Grand, which is  constantly=
 popping
up with new restaurants and bars, but it's on a  quieter safe street away f=
rom the
hustle and bustle.
There are windows on both sides of the apartment so it gets a lot of  light=
 and=20
there are 4 big closets. The entire apt has hardwood floors  and the refrig=
erator
was replaced this year. It's a 2nd floor walk up  and cats are welcome. The=
 apartment
will be unfurnished though my full  size bed is up for grabs as I'm not tak=
ing it
with me. The $2000 /month  covers rent as well as all utilities: gas, elect=
ric,=20
heat, hot water,  and wireless internet. I am also asking for a $2000 secur=
ity deposit
as  well as the subletter(s) to sign a sublease agreement. First month and =
 deposit
will be needed upfront.

$2600 per month, Bushwick (On the Bed Stuy/Williamsburg border), Two  Bedro=
om/One
Bath, Enormous Private Duplex Apartment with Garden
Available: Mid January through May 1st
We are subletting our beautiful two-story, two-bedroom apartment (that  fee=
ls more
like a house) from mid-January to May 1, 2013. It is insanely  spacious for=
 New=20
York, and also very sunny, quiet and convenient to the  city.
It was built in 1899 and we have the parlor floor and upstairs, which  feat=
ures=20
several small skylights.  It has a huge beautiful kitchen with  good applia=
nces=20
(gas stove, dishwasher, microwave) that overlooks the  wonderful backyard w=
hich=20
we share with our downstairs neighbors. The  kitchen and living room are wo=
nderful
for entertaining - very open, high  ceilings and lots of natural light.
It has two real bedrooms and one bath, and a small third room that we  use =
for our
baby. There are floor to ceiling built in bookshelves  everywhere and a gre=
at washer/dryer.
 It has been recently renovated  with taste, so although it has unbelievabl=
e old
 world charm, everything  feels clean and new.
This place is very special to us, (and really an amazing find in  general) =
 so we
very much want to find the right people. It is ideal for  a couple, or poss=
ibly=20
for two people who are renting together, but  we're not able to rent each b=
edroom
out separately.
It is located at the nexus of Williamsburg/Bushwick/Bed Stuy. It is a  five=
 minute
walk from the JMZ Flushing stop which gets you to the Lower  East Side in 7=
 minutes,
and the W4th St stop in ten. If you have a car  the street parking is relat=
ively
 easy.
Unfortunately, although we love them, we cannot have pets. It's fully  furn=
ished
 with nice things - couch, dining table, chairs, king bed, etc -  so you wo=
n't be
able to bring in furniture.
We'll also need a security deposit of one month's rent. We'd love to  answe=
r your
questions, and have you come see the place, so please get in  touch.   $2,6=
00 /=20
month includes utilities

 two=20
short stays (12/18-12/23) and (1/16-1/25) - ish
Available: Two periods in Dec & Jan (see dates)
My apartment is a spacious New York style 1-bedroom. It has five large  win=
dows=20
-- its a bright and happy place - and it's on the third floor of  a pre-war=
 building.
(No elevator.) Located on the border of Little  Italy and Soho, the apartme=
nt is
 perfectly placed in the center of the  city, only a few blocks from Chinat=
own,=20
Nolita, TriBeCa, and the Lower  East Side, and the East Village is a 15-min=
ute walk
away.
Towels and bedding and mattress are all new and freshly cleaned.
My neighborhood is filled with excellent restaurants, bars, shops and  bout=
iques,
and there are several subways (6/N/Q/B/D/J/M/Z) and a parking  lot all very=
 close.
I am looking for a cat lover -- there are two very cute and well-behaved  c=
ats here
and I am looking for someone who not only knows how to care  for cats but e=
njoys
 doing so.
There's also wireless internet, cable TV and a DVD player.
This is very important:
I'm looking for someone mature, quiet, responsible and discreet. This is  N=
OT a=20
social or party situation and therefore not the best for a young  student o=
r someone
who would like to bring the party home....
The apartment works for couples, though I prefer a single/solo person to en=
sure=20
that my neighbors are not disturbed.
Please only non-smokers. I love smokers, but not the smoking.
If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to contact me. I a=
m always
available.

My friend and I are starting 2013 with a fresh start! We need to find a  2-=
BR apt.
in Clinton HIll/Bed Stuy or Prospect Heights by Jan. 1.
The two of us met and bonded as papermakers and artists 4+ years ago  when =
we first
moved to NYC. We both are practicing artists/musicians  outside of our full=
 time
 jobs @ 2 major galleries. Due to recent  relationship upheaval, respective=
ly, we've
both been through a series of  sublets in the Clinton Hill/Bed Stuy neighbo=
rhoods.
It's time to join  forces and sign a 1-year lease!
We're looking for a reasonable 2-BR apt. preferably with laundry in the  bu=
ilding
and a place to store our bikes. We prefer to live closer to  either the A,C=
 or G
 trains.
Neither of us have pets. We're both vegetarian-(ish) simply looking for a  =
nice=20
home to settle into and cook dinners and drink a glass of wine.

> Hey artists, musicians, filmmakers, writers, designers and other beautifu=
l city folk!<br /> <br /> Looking for an easygoing, clean, drama-free roomm=
ate in late 20s-early 30s to share my awesome 3 bedroom apartment in Astori=
a. <br /> <br /> The place is huge by NYC standards - it's the first floor =
of a 2 story  house with a large living room, huge eat-in kitchen (with a  =
dishwasher!), and a large green backyard with plenty of space for summer  p=
arties. There's room to store a bike in the house hallway.  A group of  you=
ng, friendly actors live upstairs. <br /> <br /> The apartment is in a grea=
t area - 5 min from the "Steinway" R, M stop  or 10 min walk from the "Broa=
dway" N, Q stop. 15 minutes to Manhattan  and LIC or 30 min to Greenpoint a=
nd Williamsburg. There's a 24 hr Duane  Reade on the corner, restaurants, b=
ars, supermarkets, laundromats, gyms  and plenty of shopping all around. Th=
e Kaufman Astoria movie theater is  15 min away.<br /> <br /> I'm looking t=
o rent out 2 rooms:<br /> <br /> - the bedroom which is bright and very lar=
ge (16x15.5 ft, there's  currently a king size bed, a wardrobe, and 3 dress=
ers in there, with  plenty of space left), with 2 tall windows facing the s=
treet. <br /> <br /> - the attached smaller room (10.5x10 ft, perfect for a=
n art  studio/workspace, office or a second bedroom) which has a nice sized=
  closet in it. <br /> <br /> I'm a 30 year old artist and freelance transl=
ator, so usually I work  from home during the day and go out with friends a=
t night. Whatever your  schedule, as long as we can peacefully coexist, it'=
s all good. <br /> <br /> **Allergy disclaimer** you'd be sharing the house=
 with a very sweet, very affectionate, fluffy cat named Molly.&nbsp;<br /> =
<br /> The rooms are available from Dec. 15. You'll need first month's rent=
  plus an additional month's rent for security deposit to move in. Rent is =
 $1100 for 1 person, or $1400 for 2 people. Heat and gas are included in  t=
he rent, and we'd split the monthly electricity and the cable TV &  interne=
t bills. Short and long term rentals welcome.<br /> <br /> If this sounds l=
ike it would work for you, send me a note. &nbsp;<br /> <br /> Elayne<br />=

 ok.<br /> <br /> Please email me some information about yourself-what hour=

s/North Slope apartment<br /> Available: immediately through May 2013<br />=
 <br /> The apartment is a lovely two bedroom + office. I am looking for a =
roommate to take a bedroom and office. It is the third floor of a bright an=
d spacious through-apartment in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn. All rooms have =
wood floors and windows. The main room is open and sunny and the kitchen ha=
s a dishwasher. It is a beautiful apartment, and the perfect place for some=
one who loves Brooklyn, Prospect Park and has use for the extra room or off=
ice or art studio. &nbsp;</p>
<p style=3D"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=3D"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Neighborhood: The apartme=
nt is on Vanderbilt Ave. and St. Marks. A short walk to Prospect Park, Broo=
klyn Botanic Gardens and Brooklyn Museum. Easy subway access -- B,Q at 7th =
Ave., 2,3 at Grand Army Plaza and C at Clinton-Washington. An easy 30 minut=
e commute to mid-town. The neighborhood is fantastic with plenty of great r=
estaurants (James, The Vanderbilt, Franny's, Geido, Amorina, and many other=
s close by), bars (Weather Up, Hot Bird, Washington Commons, Soda, etc.), g=
rocery stores (Natural Land, Brooklyn Larder, Met Foods, bodegas), coffee s=
hops (Milk Bar, Joyce). Convenient to other Brooklyn neighborhoods -- Park =
Slope, Ft. Greene, Crown Heights (easy to many others by bike). Great for b=
iking and the park is wonderful -- great for running, riding, BBQs, the sum=
mer stage, etc.<br /> <br /> I'm a photojournalist and musician and like to=
 swim, surf, hike, and run in the park nearby. Looking for someone who's re=
sponsible, clean, easy-going, and not crazy. I work at home some days and o=
ut others, and travel quite a bit for work. While I have lived in the apart=
ment with two other roommates, I find the space is best shared between two.=
 I'm open to 2 people or a couple if it's the right situation. My current r=
oommate uses the extra room as an office but it could work as a small art s=
tudio as well. Preferably looking for someone through May (option to renew =
the lease then) but open to shorter-term as well. <br /> <br /> Please note=
 - photos are a little outdated, so some of the furniture is no longer in t=
he apt. <br /> <br /> thank you!</p>

nerous space for working, dinning table,  functional kitchen and a large ou=
t door terrace which is very enjoyable  in the spring and summer months. Th=
ere are two separate loft bedroom  areas (King size bed and full size bed) =
and one bathroom with a bathtub.  There is a laundry room in the building's=
 basement and roof access with  terrific views of the city. The building is=
 largely inhabited by  working artists.<br /> <br /> Williamsburg is a live=
ly neighborhood with cafes, bookstores, parks,  bars, boutiques, very simil=
ar to the same mood that characterizes the  East Villlage in Manhattan. The=
 loft is one stop away from Manhattan on  the on the JMZ subway train to Ma=
rcy Ave or the L subway train to  Bedford Ave, which makes the commute to u=
ptown or downtown Manhattan  fast. The loft is easy to access by taxi and b=

 /> Available: December 23rd through January 5th<br /><br /> I am looking t=
o sublet one room in a two bedroom apartment. The cool  thing about the set=
-up here is that it's essentially two studio  apartments connected by a kit=

nd a separate key entry. The only shared  space is the large kitchen which =
you will share with my roommate.  She  is a lovely up and coming playwright=
.  <br /> <br /> The ROOM itself has a peaceful sunny feel, hardwood floors=
, and comes  fully furnished with a queen size bed, couch, desk, and large =
closet.   The neighborhood is vibrant and lovely with new bars, coffeeshops=
 and  restaurants within blocks. Natural organic food market and laundry  w=
ithin one block, and a 3-5 minute walk to the Graham or the Grand L  stop. =
A hop skip and step to Mccaren park where you can run around the  track or =
visit the Saturday farmer's market. <br /> <br /> $1,400 for two weeks will=
 include rent/utilities/internet and (if you  would like) use of my sewing =
machine, easel, guitar, and large  chalkboard calendar during your stay. I'=
m asking for a $1000 security  deposit to be reimbursed at the end of your =
stay and your trust to look  over my lovingly selected thrift store trinket=
s.  Please also be  prepared to list two references as well as providing a =
copy of your  passport or ID. <br /> <br /> I'm looking for someone respect=
ful, artist-friendly, tidy, and  non-smoking. The room is big enough for a =
couple and perfect if you are  looking to spend some time in New York over =
the holidays.  No parties,  please!   I'm a little flexible on the price AN=
D DATES so please do  inquire if you are curious. <br /> <br /> Happy Holid=

36 per month, Crown Heights, Gigantic Room, Big beautiful room overlooking =
private backyard in a 2BR brownstone<br /> Available: January 3rd through M=
arch 2nd<br /><br /> Hi! I'm subletting my room for the months of January a=
nd February.  It's  a huge, gorgeous room on the ground floor of a brownsto=
ne in Crown  Heights.  The room used to be the dining room and has a built-=
in oak  mantel, built in oak buffet (that I use as a dresser), french doors=
, and  three windows that overlook the apartment's semi-private backyard.  =
 It's furnished with a queen-sized bed, desk, comfy chair, and side  table.=
<br /> <br /> Our block is really safe and quiet.  It's mostly families and=
 people  actually say Hi to you when you pass them on the street.  It's off=
 the  2/5 at President or the 3 at Nostrand.  It's a 10 minute walk to  res=
taurants and bars on Franklin Ave, a 20 minute walk to the Brooklyn  Museum=
, and just a few minutes more to Prospect Park.<br /> <br /> You would be s=
haring the apartment with a couple in their late 20s who  moved here from S=
pain last year.  They're very friendly and social and  really into the musi=
c scene.  They're really really good people.  Very  kind, inclusive, and fu=
n.  You would also be sharing the apartment with  my two sweet and affectio=
nate cats.  My roommates will be taking care of  them while I'm gone, but t=
hey'll probably still want to come in my  (your) room and sleep on the chai=
r or wherever, so you should be ok with  this.  No other pets.  Sorry :( <b=
r /> <br /> The apartment has a huge living space and huge bathroom.  Our l=
andlord lives next door and is great. <br /> <br /> The most important thin=
g, for me and my roommates, is that we find  someone who is pleasant and tr=
ustworthy.  It's a nice little home we  have here and we'd like to maintain=
 the balance.  <br /> <br /> Check out the pics, and write me if you would =
like to come see it. <br /> <br /> Other financial stuff: utilities and wif=
i are included but heat is not.   We haven't gotten our first bill but we'r=
e guessing it will be $75  each.  Also, I'm requiring that the subletter ei=
ther pay both months up  front or leave a $500 deposit.<br /><br /> <a styl=

s/bars. And a few short blocks (10 to 15 minute walk)  to the beautiful Pro=
spect Park for runs/walks/bike rides. It is also  close to the historic Gre=

ubway connections at Atlantic Ave. Also not too far from the F and G trains=
.<br /> <br /> I recently had subletters from Denmark who told me they abso=
lutely loved  staying here and I currently have a subletter from Sweden who=
 has  already told me she loves the place. I'm sure they would serve as my =
 references if you want to email them. The apt is clean and easy - all  woo=

. This does not include utilities -   which add up to about $50 month total=
 for electric and gas. And the  internet will be another 20 - 40 depending.=

y, quiet and convenient to the  city.  <br /> <br /> It was built in 1899 a=
nd we have the parlor floor and upstairs, which  features several small sky=
lights.  It has a huge beautiful kitchen with  good appliances (gas stove, =
dishwasher, microwave) that overlooks the  wonderful backyard which we shar=
e with our downstairs neighbors. The  kitchen and living room are wonderful=
 for entertaining - very open, high  ceilings and lots of natural light. <b=
r /> <br /> It has two real bedrooms and one bath, and a small third room t=
hat we  use for our baby. There are floor to ceiling built in bookshelves  =
everywhere and a great washer/dryer.  It has been recently renovated  with =
taste, so although it has unbelievable old world charm, everything  feels c=
lean and new. <br /> <br /> This place is very special to us, (and really a=
n amazing find in  general)  so we very much want to find the right people.=
 It is ideal for  a couple, or possibly for two people who are renting toge=
ther, but  we're not able to rent each bedroom out separately. <br /> <br /=
> It is located at the nexus of Williamsburg/Bushwick/Bed Stuy. It is a  fi=
ve minute walk from the JMZ Flushing stop which gets you to the Lower  East=
 Side in 7 minutes, and the W4th St stop in ten. If you have a car  the str=
eet parking is relatively easy.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, although we lov=
e them, we cannot have pets. It's fully  furnished with nice things - couch=
, dining table, chairs, king bed, etc -  so you won't be able to bring in f=
urniture. <br /> <br /> We'll also need a security deposit of one month's r=
ent. We'd love to  answer your questions, and have you come see the place, =
so please get in  touch.   $2,600 / month includes utilities<br /><br /> <a=

ated on the border of Little  Italy and Soho, the apartment is perfectly pl=

TriBeCa, and the Lower  East Side, and the East Village is a 15-minute walk=
 away. <br /> <br /> Towels and bedding and mattress are all new and freshl=

s, bars, shops and  boutiques, and there are several subways (6/N/Q/B/D/J/M=
/Z) and a parking  lot all very close.<br /> <br /> I am looking for a cat =
lover -- there are two very cute and well-behaved  cats here and I am looki=

.<br /> <br /> There's also wireless internet, cable TV and a DVD player.<b=

ture, quiet, responsible and discreet. This is  NOT a social or party situa=

 disturbed.<br /> <br /> Please only non-smokers. I love smokers, but not t=
