Label News

Alright everyone, it's September, it's hot as all hell, Hopscotch is
this weekend, I'm a hair's breadth away from the latter half of my
thirties, and it's time to write this update. Let's get to it.

So, the new releases are dangerously close to being ready. Currently
we have approved test pressings for Whatever Brains, Louder,
Davidians, Skem=C3=A4ta, and Gay Kiss, and all we need is final word from
Dark Ages and those will be on their as well. Still waiting on tests
for Broken Prayer.

The Whatever Brains double 12" has also been pressed and the vinyl is
slowly ambling across the United States as I start the long and
arduous process of screen printing 300 jackets and obi strips. We'll
definitely have a bunch of these ready for the band's official record
release show at Nice Price Books on September 19
(https://www.facebook.com/events/823299667680575/ (
https://www.facebook.com/events/823299667680575/ )), and hopefully
we'll have enough assembled to start selling them online and in the
store on that date as well. It seems like, after years of calling them
the most underrated band in the world, there's actually a buzz about
this record. There have been track premiers and accompanying kind
words on well-respected music sites like Noisey (
http://noisey.vice.com/en_ca/blog/whatever-brains-ny-dodger-premiere )
and Tiny Mix Tapes (
http://www.tinymixtapes.com/chocolate-grinder/premiere-whatever-brains-sto=
xx-or-athletics
) (note: we didn't hire a publicist, these things just happened), and
there are even more people than usual coming up to me and saying how
much they love the Brains. So here's hoping this release will be a big
one.

I'm sure you're all itching for a track premier, and luckily I have
one for you. Here's "The Dark One" from the upcoming Dark Ages LP:

So, even though our crazy release schedule has me losing sleep at
night, I actually have a couple more things to announce this update.
First off, we'll be helping to release the US pressing of
Oblivionation's phenomenal Language of Violence LP. If you remember
from my previous distro update, I kind of flipped out about this LP
when the European pressing passed through the distro, and when Rock N
Roll Disgrace ran into some problems getting the record out we stepped
in to lend a hand. My admiration for this band was only cemented this
past weekend when they made it all the way down to Raleigh to peel
back my face in person. So, hopefully this will be out on vinyl
sometime in September, but for now you can listen to the whole thing
on Oblivionation's BandCamp site:

Language Of Violence by OBLIVIONATION (
http://oblivionation.bandcamp.com/album/language-of-violence )

Finally, me and Seth's band No Love just finished recording six new
tracks. Two of these will serve as Volume 2 of Sorry State's North
Carolina Singles Series (the aforementioned Davidians record is volume
1), and the other four songs will comprise our second cassette
release, this time on Sorry State rather than being self-released.
We'll have a few copies of the cassette (along with new shirts (
http://instagram.com/p/sao-Vlpzz9/?modal=3Dtrue )) at this weekend's
Hopscotch Music Fest ( http://hopscotchmusicfest.com/ ) in Raleigh,
and the official version should be out and available online in 2 weeks
or so. If you're itching to hear some of it before then, word is that
NPR Music will be premiering a new song tomorrow or Thursday as part
of their coverage of Hopscotch, and our pal Matt at Damaged Goods
Radio ( http://www.damagedgoodsradio.com/ ) is going to be premiering
a track or two and also broadcasting an interview with us on the next
episode of his show. If you miss it, though, don't worry because he
posts links to download each show after they air.

I think that's enough news for now... I'm exhausted just typing it all
out! And of course I'll be in touch as each of these new releases
drop.

Jeff's Update

Hey Sorry Staters!

Before I get into my record picks for August, I want to mention a few
things first:

I=E2=80=99ve only had a little over a week to catch up since I got back =
from
being on tour with Skem=C3=A4ta.  It was awesome!  Thanks so much to
everyone who took care of us and showed us a good time!  We also just
got done playing a killer show in Richmond with Impalers.  Always
awesome to see those dudes tear it up!  We=E2=80=99ve got another show =
with
Oblivionation (which I=E2=80=99m beyond stoked about).  We=E2=80=99ll have =
just a
small handful of leftover pre-release LPs for the show.  After that,
Cameron will be on tour with Davidians, so Skem=C3=A4ta won=E2=80=99t be =
doing a
hell of a lot until after our LP officially comes out.

Speaking of records coming out, I can personally say that Sorry State
is about to drop some serious bangers in quick succession!  It=E2=80=99ll =
be
a little while before they=E2=80=99re available, but we have a few of the
test presses for the upcoming releases sitting here in the store, and
I can=E2=80=99t help but blast them constantly.  The Louder LP is really
cool.  Gay Kiss=E2=80=99s new record destroys.  Davidians=E2=80=99 new =
single
surpasses their first 7=E2=80=9D.  And if any of you reading this have =
been
anticipating it as eagerly as I have, prepare to be blown away by the
new Dark Ages record.

As always, there have also been some great records added to the
distro.  First and foremost, the new Glue 7=E2=80=9D is so killer!  Also
check out Ivy=E2=80=99s new LP, Nervous Trend LP, Orden Mundial: =
Obediencia
Debida 12=E2=80=9D, Juanita Y Los Feos: Nueva Numancia 12=E2=80=9D, and =
again,
probably a bunch of stuff that I missed.

Thanks for reading.

Until next month!

-Jeff

Seth's Update

It=E2=80=99s been a great month for records.  We=E2=80=99ve gotten a ton =
of stuff
in this month that has been awesome.  The two 7=E2=80=9Ds I kept finding
myself listening to over and over were the Frau 7=E2=80=9D (super punk and
snotty with an early Bratmobile feel) and the Nancy 7=E2=80=9D (super =
poppy
but driving stuff similar to maybe Nobunny or the Spits).  We just got
in the new Ex-Cult 7=E2=80=9D also which I=E2=80=99ve been listening to =
all day
while typing this.  Also the Neo Punx, Screaming Sneakers, and PF
Commando represses have been getting a lot of play from me lately.
The Flesh Wounds Lp has gotten tons of play for me, it=E2=80=99s great
throaty garage punk.  I think we=E2=80=99re almost out again so jump on it
fast.  Also get the new Apache Dropout LP, it=E2=80=99s a super solid LP
from start to end.   I also suggest the Ty Segall, Crime, Slugz, and
Inmates 12=E2=80=9Ds.  Oh yeah and the Crisis LP is amazing and I was =
really
excited to see the New Hope Comp get repressed.  So get that stuff.
Do it.

-Seth

Daniel's Update

Seth and Jeff did a good job of hitting the highlights, especially
given that six of my most listened-to records of the month--the new
Hank Wood LP, the Mystic Inane 7", the Juanita Y Los Feos LP, the
Outsiders LP reissue, the Savageheads 7", and the Primetime 7"--are
already out of stock. Hopefully we can restock all of those very soon
because they're all well worth owning. As for what's left, Seth's
right... that Frau 7" is an absolute banger... gnarly girl-punk that
goes right up to the edge chaos without going over... pure intensity.
For garage-y stuff you can't go wrong with the Flesh Wounds or Slugz
LPs, and if you like those you should grab the Golden Pelicans LP when
we restock that as well. Finally, the Glue 7" is just disgustingly
good, easily matching and even surpassing their incredible demo.

Featured Distro Items

Protester: S/T 7" (Trash King)
After a total stomper of a demo, here's the debut 7" from Washington,
DC's Protester. Protester are another one of those one-man bands with
one guy playing all the instruments, and you can tell that Connor is
probably more than a little bit inspired by Violent Reaction's similar
origins. However, while both bands unabashedly rep the straight edge,
Protester have a bit more in common with the youth crew classics and
dispense with the oi! edge that VxRx has. Admittedly, I'm not one to
jam much youth crew now that I'm in my mid-30s, but that has as much
Agnostic Front and Abused in it as it does Bold and Side by Side, and
like the best bands on The Way It Is Connor definitely knows how to
write a catchy, memorable hardcore song. Great production, explosive
performance... if you're into this style of hardcore this record is
100% essential.

Zex: Savage City 7" (Electric Assault)
2nd EP from this new Canadian band, and I have to say I am totally in
love with this thing... when I heard their first EP I kind of wondered
if it was a fluke, because it sounded like the band couldn't really
make up their mind whether they wanted to be a UK82-style punk band or
more of NWOBHM revival-type thing, and the tension between those two
sounds led to some really interesting songwriting. However, this time
around the a-side is a bit different... a totally straightforward
melodic punk banger with huge, powerful lady vox. Honestly, this is
kind of what I always wished that Vice Squad sounded like, but they
don't... it's basically simple and straightforward UK82 punk with
vocals that have a ton of personality a la X Ray Spex or something
like that. The b-side does have that UK82-meets-NWOBHM hybrid sound of
the first single, so if you liked that you'll probably be way into the
b-side track. Both songs, though, have great production and are
carried by a vocalist that has more charisma than just about anyone I
can think of at the moment. Definitely recommended.

Much Worse: Ambivalence cassette (self-released)
Brand new limited tour cassette release from this Minneapolis band
that I think can now officially claim veteran status within the
hardcore scene. From the first time I heard Much Worse my line on them
was "Jerry's Kids meets Gauze..." a comment which I'm pretty sure
directly led to them putting out a record on No Way. I think that line
still pretty much holds up, particularly given that on this recording
they're joined for the first time by Raleigh's own Jerry's Kids
fanatic Ira Rogers, he of skin-pounding in the mighty Stripmines (as
well as me and Jeff's band Prosthesis). The riffs come at you fast and
furious one after the other, with very few pauses for traditional
hardcore buildups and breakdowns. I know there are some who derisively
refer to this style of songwriting as "riff salad," but when the riffs
are as inventive and exciting as these there's definitely a lot of
pleasure to be had in letting them just wash over you. Definitely an
essential release for you fast hardcore fanatics, and hopefully it'll
see vinyl sooner or later.

Glue: S/T 7" (Katorga Works)
Debut EP (their previous one was their demo pressed to vinyl) from
Texas's Glue, and I'm calling it right now that this is one of the top
5 hardcore records of the year. I absolutely loved their demo... along
with the Oblivionation LP and the S.H.I.T. 7"s it's one of my most
listened-to hardcore records of recent memory, and this EP might be
even better. It's still in the same vein, pounding along with kind of
an SSD sensibility... tons of bands go for that, but there's something
about Glue that just elevates them to another level. The riffs are
obscenely catchy, and the vocals seem like your standard hardcore
garbled nonsense at first, but they're also perfectly placed and
utterly memorable. There are also a few new little twists here, like a
blazing guitar solo on the last track and some Oblivionation-style
quirky but catchy little changes scattered throughout. Basically, if
you care anything about hardcore in the year 2014 you need this
record... completely essential and highly recommended.

Institute: Giddy Boys 7" (Katorga Works)
Debut EP from this band out of Texas and it's a considerable step up
from their demo, which was recently pressed onto a 12" by Deranged.
The sound here is anarcho-punk, but it's definitely on the more
straightforwardly punk (even hardcore?) end of that spectrum. Crisis
seems like an obvious inspiration (particularly on the b-side track,
"Fate in a Pleasant Mood"), and honestly I can't think of a single
recent band off the top of my head that has captured the sound and
spirit of catchy anarcho bands like Crisis and Zounds as adeptly as
Institute has here. Like the best of those bands, there's a lot to
like here, with lots of interesting interplay between the guitars and
bass and a kind of muted pop sensibility throughout. Yet another
winner from Katorga Works.

Pink Sock: Flexi 7" (Lumpy)
7-song, 1-sided flexi from this St. Louis band... that's quite a lot
of songs to fit onto one side of a flexi, so as you can imagine these
are short, snappy, and raw as hell. The recording is terrible in a
good way, with drums pretty much non-existent except for a
consistently crashing cymbal and vocals right up front spewing snot
everywhere. The playing is also absolutely unhinged... it sounds like
the band is playing way faster than they're used to and barely keeping
it together, and the energy level is just through the roof... if
you're into the This Is Boston Not LA-era recordings of the Freeze,
the FU's, and Gang Green you'll definitely be able to get down with
this.

Cal and the Calories: Demo 7" (Lumpy)
So, if you're like me and you actually sat down to listen to that
giant pile of cassingles that Lumpy / Spotted Race put out a while
back, you probably know that the Cal and the Calories one was the pick
of the litter, and this is a vinyl pressing of that very tape. The
story I remember hearing on this is that these were recorded just like
the Lumpy & the Dumpers tracks, with Martin playing all of the
instruments, but that these tracks were too poppy for Lumpy, whether
by design or by accident I'm not sure. At any rate, this has the same
stomping, driving punk sensibility and nasty production of the Lumpy
records, but they're poppier and more vocal-oriented. There's
definitely a palpable Ramones influence, particularly in "My Calorie,"
and that added catchy/melodic makes this go down even smoother. Some
people will almost certainly prefer this to the proper Lumpy material,
and I'm thinking I may count myself among that group...

Nancy: [Get the] Revvup 7" (Eat the Life)
Debut single from this NYC band who had a killer demo a while back.
The only bad thing I can say about this record is that it's almost
painfully short... Nancy sound like a slightly poppier version of the
Spits... the guitars are big, simple, and Ramones-influenced, and the
vocals have the kind of nasal sound of early Europunk bands like Lost
Kids or Ivy Green. Like the Spits, they're also about concision, so
only two songs leaves me really, REALLY wanting more... if you like
garage-punk whose guitars have balls while the vocals satisfy your pop
sweet tooth this is bound to be a favorite.

Ivy: S/T 12" (Katorga Works)
Debut 12" from this NYC band. Even though this is on Katorga Works
it's kind of more in the Toxic State camp... like those bands, there's
a kind of minimalist / artsy tendency at work while at the same time
being straightforwardly, aggressively punk. You know their guitarist
Shiva from Deformity and his Stooges-influenced wailing is in full
effect here, and the vocalist previously sang in Brown Sugar and if
you liked that band you'll immediately recognize his unique vocal
stylings. As Katorga Works' description notes, on the surface this
seems totally straightforward, but the band has an underlying
uniqueness that can't help but shine through here.

Golden Pelicans: S/T 12" (Total Punk)
I think Florida's Golden Pelicans have kind of a parallel history to
North Carolina's Flesh Wounds, who I've also been listening to and
thinking about a lot lately. The bands sound quite similar (almost
strikingly similar in places, really). Both bands put out 7"s that I
thought were solid without totally blowing me away. Both bands also
stepped things up considerably when they made the jump to big vinyl,
and like the Flesh Wounds LP, the Golden Pelicans 12" is one of the
must-hear garage releases of the season. There's nothing terribly out
of the box here, just amped-up, catchy garage-punk in the tradition
that runs from the Stones to the Heartbreakers to the Oblivians to
now. However, either a band like this has it or they don't, and this
is one of the good ones.

Mystic Inane: Deep Creep 7" (Negative Jazz)
After two fantastic tapes (the second of which in particular has been
one of my favorite tape releases of the past few years), we finally
get a vinyl debut from New Orleans' Mystic Inane. If you dug that
great second tape this one pretty much picks up right where that left
off... it's got a recording that's bright and clear, but with a kind
of thin, sharp, and angular guitar sound. A couple of the songs on the
tape had kind of an upbeat, quirky, Minutemen-type feel, but this time
around Mystic Inane settle into more of a groove, relying less on
quirky riffs and more on their charisma and ability to write really
stellar hooks. If you're into old, minimal punk like the Urinals or
Wire, or even the new London stuff like Personnel, Frau, and Good
Throb this is a 7" you definitely want to check out... highly
recommended.

Party Plates: S/T 7" (Non Commercial)
Another new band/record from the familiar Cleveland crew that's
brought us dozens of great bands over the past 20 years or so...
there's a reason that people collect everything that comes from this
little micro-scene, because whatever the genre (whether it's the
straight up hardcore of Inmates, the street punk of Cider, or Party
Plates' more metallic sound), there's an unhinged, nihilistic quality
to the records that very, very few bands are able to capture
successfully on vinyl. As I mentioned, Party Plates are a little more
metal than your typical Clevo hardcore, but it's still raw, fast, and
unhinged... I'm reminded of tons of bands... early GISM, Venom's first
LP, forgotten thrash metal demos like Black Task... if you're into
punk-tinged early 80s metal or if you just like to keep an eye on
everything coming out of Cleveland you'll definitely want to check
this out.

Step Forward: S/T 7" (Painkiller)
Long in the works 2nd 7" from this Boston straight edge band. When I
say it's been long in the works, I mean it... the band's first stab at
recording it was way back in 2009. Musically, this thing is really
cool, and a bit different from the more recent Boston stuff that's
extremely singular in its intent and purpose. This is a little more
all over the map, mixing a bunch of different styles of straight edge
hardcore from the more melodic end of the spectrum like Chain of
Strength with some faster, clearly Straight Ahead-inspired parts. A
snappy little hardcore EP.

System Fucker: S/T 12" (Distort Reality)
New 12" from this gnarly Japanese hardcore band that toured the US a
few months ago. Like their live set, this is blistering stuff... sort
of somewhere between a traditional, heavy Japanese hardcore sound and
the noisier end of things like D-Clone. Live they actually reminded me
a lot of DSB, though things are a little wilder, rawer, and noisier
here. Recommended for the kind of people who chased down Blood Sucker
Records releases in the late 90s and early 00s.

The Outsiders: Close Up 12" (Captured Tracks)
Reissue of this 70s UK punk band that was led by Adrian Boreland
before he went on to form the Sound, one of the very best post-punk
bands. As you might expect from "the punk band before the post-punk
band" (as my friend Neil put it), this is a little more
straightforward and guitar-oriented than the Sound stuff (even their
great first record, Jeopardy), but Boreland already has the seeds of
greatness in his songwriting. As a lover of '77 punk, it's great to
hear his knack for hooks applied to such high-energy, guitar-oriented
music. Definitely an essential reissue if you're a fan of the Sound,
but anyone into tuneful, energetic '77 punk like the Lurkers or the
Boys should definitely pick this up as well.

Mercy Killings: 2-song promo cassette (Beach Impediment)
So, this is titled 2-song promo cassette because it features 2 songs
from their upcoming EP on Beach Impediment (which is even better than
their first, I assure you), but it also features a well-recorded live
set from Boston, so you're getting a lot more than just two songs
here. Highly recommended, naturally.

Slugz: S/T 12" (Feel It)
Long in the works debut LP from this Virginia punk band featuring
members of a slew of Richmond hardcore and punk bands like Southside
Stranglers, Nightstalker, Cretins, and many more I'm sure. This is
definitely more punk than hardcore, though... on their earlier records
I think Slugz were going for more of a '77/KBD kind of thing, but this
time around the tempos are a little faster, the vocals are a little
grittier, and the recording is quite a bit stronger. I think that if
someone just put this on and I didn't know what it was I would assume
that it was from Japan in the 90s... it definitely has the amped-up,
high-energy rock and roll vibe of classics like the Teengenerate and
the Registrators, and the kind of garbled vocals even sound at times
like the singer has a Japanese accent. Aside from maybe Louder and the
Black and Whites (both of whom are slightly more on the melodic, UK
'77 end of the spectrum), I can't think of any band in the world
(Japan included) who are doing this style this well... if your idea of
heaven is the combination of garage-punk hooks and hardcore energy you
need to get this now.

Nuts #14 zine
Latest issue of this great, giant zine out of NYC. This time around
it's shorter, but there's a ton of content crammed into it, including
an interview with Gas Rag, a long review of New York's Alright Fest,
and a bunch of other content including the usual top-notch artwork.

Orden Mundial: Obediencia Debida 12" (La Vida Es Un Mus)
Second LP from this band out of Mallorca, Spain, and it's a big
improvement over their first in my opinion. The label description
references noisy hardcore greats like Wretched and United Mutation,
and I'm inclined to agree. To me, it has the wildness and rawness
(particularly in the guitar tone) of Wretched, but some songs sound
like they've been filtered through the lens of 80s USHC... as someone
who came up worshipping old USHC and only later latched on to the
rawer, more Discharge-influenced stuff this is quite a pleasing sound.
Really, though, this is a tough one to pigeonhole as it isn't one of
those records where every song sounds the same... you know that Paco
at LVEUM only releases top-notch hardcore, and this fits the bill.

In School: Tour Tape 2014 cassette (self-released)
Tour-only cassette from these gnarly NYC ladies. Collects their demo
tape and their Praxis of Hate EP on one cassette... angry, literate,
and bruising hardcore... a feminist Agnostic Front? Nog Watt if they
were skinheads? Whatever you want to call it, this rips.

Hank Wood & the Hammerheads: Stay Home 12" (Toxic State)
Yes, the new Hank Wood LP is finally here! Like a lot of you, I've
been jamming mp3s of this for the past few weeks, and after finally
hearing the vinyl I have to say it sounds a lot better... the
mastering job here sounds a little denser and more straightforward
than the digital version, which when combined with the always-spot-on
Toxic State packaging makes this absolutely essential to own on wax.
If you haven't heard Hank Wood yet, they're one of the most unique and
exciting bands in punk today... kinda surf-y, kinda garage-y riffs
augmented with Sonics-style farfisa organ, a supplementary
percussionist that makes some totally wild rhythms, and vocals that
are more like really simple rapping than any punk vocalist you've
heard before. It's a wild combination, but it's completely infectious,
as anyone who has heard the band will tell you. Definitely one of the
best LPs of 2014, and highly recommended.

Neo-Punkz: Fascist Fuckerz 7" (La Vida Es Un Mus)
Official reissue of this banger from Holland 1980... total
Bloodstains vibes on this one with its raw, tinny guitar sound,
tossed-off-feeling song structures, and mega-snotty vocals. I know
that's a turn off to some people, but for followers of the KBD
religion it's the ultimate turn-on, and this one has it in spades. I
swear, if I didn't know better I'd almost assume that this was one of
those "fake punk" projects (i.e. non-punks parodying punk music),
because everything about this is just so over-the-top punk that it's
almost silly. Still, a total banger...

Suspense: Murder with the Axe (La Vida Es Un Mus)
Official reissue of the 4-song 7" from this Dutch band who started
off as Neo Punkz but went through a couple of lineup changes and
changed their name to Suspense. If you think they've matured since
their days in Neo Punkz you'll be sorely disappointed as this is
similarly raw and obnoxious. I guess they may have "progressed" a
little bit as the a-side here is a 3-minute long dirge, but it's a
dead-simple Euro punker built around a cheesy but memorable phaser
effect on the guitar. On the b-side you get 3 hard-and-fast tracks
that are more or less in line with the songs on the Neo Punkz 7", but
maybe with a little bit more of a UK82-type influence. Honestly,
though, what it really sounds like is old DC hardcore like Teen Idles
or the Untouchables... these tracks could have easily fit on the Flex
Your Head LP. Totally killer.

Crisis: Kollectiv 2x12" (La Vida Es Un Mus)
So, La Vida Es Un Mus reissued Crisis's great full-length a couple of
years ago, but this is the Crisis reissue I was really waiting for. If
you don't know Crisis, along with Zounds and the Mob they kind of form
the holy trinity of melodic-anarcho-post-punk (sorry, I couldn't fit
any more adjectives in there!). Taking musical influence from bands
like Joy Division and fusing it with the politics of Crass, these were
some of the best punk bands ever, and Crisis is right at the top of
the pack. One of the members also famously went on to form Death in
June, whose early records at least have a similar melodic sensibility
to Crisis. Now that we have that out of the way, here we have two
entire LPs devoted to the band's early career. Side A plays the band's
three immaculate singles straight through, and you'd be hard-pressed
to find a stronger run of three singles outside the mainstream '77 set
that everyone knows... all of the a-sides and b-sides are great, and
"Holocaust" (the a-side to their first single) is an all-time punk
anthem. Moving onto side two, we have a demo session from 1978
including alternate versions of a couple of tracks also on the singles
and the LP as well as two unreleased tracks (though they did appear on
the Holocaust Hymns CD collection released some years ago). Don't let
"demo session" scare you off... these are strong recordings and the
mastering job here absolutely explodes out of the speakers. On the
second LP you get a live set recorded in Norway in 1979, and like the
demo session the fidelity here is strong and you will actually listen
to it more than once. I should also mention the packaging here, which
is a heavy tip-on gatefold with full-color reproductions of the single
covers on the inside along with a bunch of vintage press clippings. A
fitting testament to a truly seminal band.

Los Crudos: Cobardes 7" (La Vida Es Un Mus)
Four hard to find Crudos tracks comped onto one 7"... includes three
tracks that were originally released on compilations back in the day
as well as one that was a CD-only bonus track on their discography CD.
Four vintage slices of Crudos' 90s hardcore attack and they sound
great on wax!

Juanita Y Los Feos: Nueva Numancia 12" (La Vida Es Un Mus)
Oh man, total banger alert here... this LP is different from just
about anything that Paco has ever released (at least to my mind), but
I just can't stop listening to it. I'm hesitant to throw out genre
descriptors here because this LP is totally unique and throwing around
words like "new wave," "post-punk," or "melodic punk" is bound to be
misleading, but there are elements of all three at work here. The
guitarist is doing this kind of minimal thing where most of the time
he's just bouncing around on one or two strings, playing these simple,
infectious melodies while the bass is more straightforward, holding
down the rhythm with simpler riffs... the interplay between the two is
akin to some of the early Joy Division songs (like, say, "Shadowplay")
but these songs are upbeat, bouncy, and fun rather than dour. There's
also some super catchy synth in the mix (not a ton, though), and
mega-catchy lady vocals that remind me of Silla Electrica. It's kind
of hard to describe how it all comes together since it's so totally
unique, but everyone who I've played this for has been totally taken
aback by how original, catchy, and vital it sounds. If the right
people hear this I could see this band getting huge, at least within
our little corner of the punk scene. Regardless, if the above
description interests you I highly encourage you to get this... it's
totally great.

Primetime: S/T 7" (La Vida Es Un Mus)
Absolutely BRILLIANT debut EP by this new all-lady band from London.
Word is that this band originally formed out of a project called First
Timers, which brings together people who have never played music
before (or maybe are playing new instruments? Not sure what the actual
rules are...) to create exciting new sounds. When I listen to these
four tracks I can't help but think of the mighty Delta 5 as the singer
has quite a similar voice, but if you want a more contemporary
reference these gals have a similarly awesome combination of fuck you
punk spirit and complete joy de vivre as Good Throb. I can see fans of
the classic power-pop stylings of bands like the #1s also being into
this, but the music is a lot simpler and more direct, with just a
smidge of post-punk-iness. I just can't say enough good things about
this record... it's one of things that just gives me a huge smile
every time I put it on. Highly recommended.

Qloaqa Letal: S/T 12" (Metadona)
Vinyl reissue of the 1983 cassette by this early Spanish punk band.
Apparently this tape has been heavily circulated in Spain and is
well-known among Spanish punks, but virtually unknown to the rest of
the world. It's hard to understand why this has been buried so long,
because it's totally great! The music exists right on that fruitful
border between punk and hardcore, in the same place occupied by bands
like the Stalin, LP-era Germs, early Black Flag, and others who sought
to make something more intense than regular old punk but were either
ignorant of or did not care about the emerging conventions of the
hardcore scene. Musically, this actually reminds me quite a bit of the
Stalin (with both some of the rawness of Trash and some of the
riffiness of Stop Jap), but Seth mentioned that the vocals have a
gnarly, GISM-like quality and I must say I have to agree. Really,
though, if this has anything in common with Japanese punk it would be
more with the early ADK kind of sound, and like some of those bands
there's also a bit of a Killing Joke / proto-industrial influence at
work here as well. The songs and performance are great, the production
is raw without losing any power, and the vocalist is insanely
charismatic... I know there are a lot of reissues these days and it's
hard to figure out what to actually get excited about, but this is
something special.

Mankind: S/T 7" (Quality Control HC)
I'm not sure that the world needs another band named after an Infest
song, but UKHC is killing it so hard right now that I decided to give
these guys a listen anyway, and I'm glad that I did. Given the
geographic connection I imagine that people will probably compare
these guys to the Flex, and indeed both bands share an affinity for
breakdowns that nudge right up to the edge of cheesiness without going
over. I call it the "tasteful breakdown." Where Mankind shines, to me,
though, are on the fast parts... they have a real early 80s USHC feel,
reminding me of stuff like Articles of Faith or Mecht Mensch, or maybe
even early Corrosion of Conformity. I don't know if other people will
necessarily make that comparison as most people into early 80s HC will
probably just hear the breakdowns and be turned off, but the hoarse,
powerful vocals and interesting rhythms on the fast parts are
definitely a cut above.

Pertti Kurikan Nimipaivat: Jarmo 7" (JT Classics)
Debut 7" from this Finnish punk band, released on JT Classics, which
is a label run by one of the guys from Hard Skin. Apparently there is
a documentary film about this band and all four of the members are
learning disabled, but even if you didn't know that this is a nice
little slab of raw and direct punk. The rhythms are dead simple in a
early oi! kind of way, but the vocals are a little catchier, reminding
me of the early Euro punk sound. This also has a great recording... it
kind of reminds me of the Achtungs stuff in that it's both raw and
powerful, vintage without sounding retro in a goofy way. I'm not sure
if these guys are actually "punks" per se, but something about it
seems to me like the band is responding to punk, but isn't bogged down
by the awareness of punk's long history that so many bands nowadays
tend to have (and, in some respects, are often shackled by)... in
other words, this sounds incredibly fresh and direct in a way that few
bands since the glory days of the late '70s have. It won't be for
everyone since it's ever so slightly outside of the box, but that very
uniqueness means that the people who love this will REALLY love it.

Screaming Sneakers: S/T 7" (bootleg)
7" reissue of the uber-rare 12" by this 80s punk band out of Florida.
Screaming Sneakers' lone record is such an odd piece of music, and a
total 80s artifact... even though this is definitely punk, there's
something about this record (in particular the vocals) that have such
an 80s pop sensibility... it's like the singer had fully internalized
the melodic sensibilities of 80s pop artists like the Go-Gos, the
Bangles, and Cyndi Lauper and even though she's singing in a punk band
those influences can't help but come out in a subtle way. Who knows if
anyone else gets that impression from this record, but that's what I
hear. Anyway, the music is the kind of melodic punk that seemed to be
big in the 80s, but died at some point... I guess there are still
melodic punk bands, but nowadays they tend to be way too polished and
end up sounding like a Lookout! or Fat Wreck type thing. However, this
is just big-hooks, melodic punk in the tradition of 70s punk bands but
with the raw production of 80s hardcore. Kind a museum piece, but a
good one, and way cheaper than an original copy.

Foreseen: S/T 7" (Mind Rot)
Raging two-song single of blistering thrash metal from this band out
of Helsinki, Finland. Total mid-80s-style production and sound all the
way around, recalling classics like Nuclear Assault, Slayer, and the
best moments of later D.R.I. and Crumbsuckers. This was released on a
small hardcore label out of Richmond, Virginia, so I'm not sure how
hip the metalheads are to this yet, but this is easily one of the best
retro-thrash records I've heard in ages.

Crown Court: Trouble from London cassette (Mind Rot)
Note: now available in a US pressing at a lower price. Demo tape from
this new London band originally released on the impeccable Quality
Control HC label. This isn't really HC, but it definitely keeps with
the theme of quality control because it absolutely rules. Crown Court
are an oi! band, but it seems like most of the bands with an
oi!-influenced sound these days tend to mix that influence with
American hardcore (think Violent Future, Violent Reaction, etc.);
however, Crown Court are straight up, melodic oi!. They bear more than
a passing resemblance to a certain band who started as a great rootsy
rock band and later turned into the most famous bonehead band in the
world (hint: they're named after a common tool)... there's definitely
some rocked-out riffing and leads, and the vocals are just perfect...
hoarse and catchy, belting out simple melodies you can chant on your
next trip down to the football stadium. The oi! trend is definitely
starting to run a little dry, but this is completely different and
wholly invigorating. Highly recommended.

PF Commando: Rough Sound 7" (Ugly Pop)
Reissue of the 1980 EP by this classic Swedish punk band. This single
shows considerable development over their earlier LP, with the a-side
"Rough Sound" capturing a raw, driving rock and roll sound that brings
to mind the unhinged sound of early Australian punk 45s by bands like
the Chosen Few and the Victims. You also get two tracks on the b-side
in roughly the same vein, perhaps with a bit of second-wave UK punk
flavor thrown in... all in all a blistering little single that I'm
glad to see is back in print.

PF Commando: Manipulerade Mongon 12" (Ugly Pop)
Reissue of this Swedish band's 1979 debut LP, which is considered by
many to be the first Swedish punk LP. The label mentions the Dead
Boys, the Germs, and Black Flag as touchstones for this, and of the
three I'd say the Dead Boys is the closest reference... this is less
fully-formed punk per se and more like totally hateful, revved-up rock
and roll music. Rather than relying on the basic pop hooks of
first-wave Euro punkers like Ivy Green and Lost Kids, this is all
about the power of the riff, and as such sounds more like the early
Australian punk bands like Radio Birdman and the Murder Punk groups,
though without such a pronounced Stooges influence. All in all it's a
great little slice of punk history, and Ugly Pop has done their usual
stellar job with the reissue, even including a rad 36"x12" insert with
liner notes, vintage flyers and press, and other info about the band
and release.

Flesh Wounds: S/T 12" (Snot Releases)
After a single on Merge(!), here's the debut LP from North Carolina's
Flesh Wounds. I liked the Merge single but thought it sounded a bit
too produced for the band, but this LP captures Flesh Wounds at their
raw, snotty, and catchy best. Flesh Wounds is definitely in the same
minimal garage-punk vein as bands like Sick Thoughts, the Reatards,
Teengenerate, etc., which is a style I can really love but really hate
when it's done poorly. Flesh Wounds nail it here, though... fast,
near-hardcore tempos, raw vocals, and insanely catchy lead guitar all
over everything. The best garage rock record to come out of North
Carolina ever? Maybe, and I think it's a national contender as well.
Self-released and crazy limited (I think I heard something about 200
copies?), so if you're interested don't sleep...

Running for Cover: demo 12" (Painkiller)
12" re-release of the 2003 demo by this band who I think hailed from
upstate New York. Yeah, this is fast and as such all of the usual
power violence pioneers (No Comment, Crossed Out, etc.) deserve a
namecheck, but Running for Cover are a lot more straightforward.
Rather than relying on the fast/slow dynamic that propels a lot of
bands like this, Running for Cover are more or less all go no slow...
listening to this is less like listening to some power violence
tribute act and more like listening to a good 80s USHC record on 45RPM
instead of 33. The recording also sounds absolutely fantastic... the
drums in particular really cut through, and the drummer plays a lot on
the ride and the recording perfectly captures that propulsive ping
that makes this sound insanely energetic. Definitely the kind of
record that can appeal both to people who love power violence as well
as those of us who just love straight up hardcore.

Inmates: S/T 12" (Painkiller)
Brand new, long-awaited album from these Cleveland miscreants. It's
been a while since we heard from Inmates, and you'll probably not be
surprised to learn that they haven't lost a step. They still play
blistering, almost manic hardcore with great riffs, a slight Japanese
hardcore influence (more Systematic Death than Death Side though) and
super mean and nasty lyrics. This new LP has a totally killer
recording, and if the songs weren't already energetic enough this
recording makes them totally explode out of the speakers... I think
it's safe to say that no existing Inmates fans will be disappointed by
this record, and I'm sure there will be a lot of new people on the
bandwagon thanks to this.

Savageheads: S/T 7" (Twerp)
After a blistering demo tape here's the debut vinyl from Boston's
Savageheads, and it's even BETTER than the demo! They're still
unabashedly influenced by the Partisans, making absolutely brilliant
use of that classic 1-2, 1-2 UK82 beat. I can't really think of
anything to say about this other than GET IT, because if you're a punk
you will love this record. Simple, catchy riffs, bruising vocals, and
a rhythm section that sounds like it's done a pharmacy full of
speed... what's not to like? Great packaging, too, including a huge
poster. Highly recommended!

Frau: Punk Is My Boyfriend 7" (Static Shock)
More great punk out of the absolutely untouchable London scene... as
I mentioned when I wrote about their demo (which has recently been
re-pressed on a 12" by Dead Beat), Frau features Ash from Good Throb
on vocals, and while I would venture to guess that Good Throb fans
will dig Frau, it might be for different reasons. Far less
straightforward than their demo, this 7" is a sound I haven't heard
before... quirky, agitated, hyper-fast, aggressive but not tough...
it's basically everything that I want punk to be. I guess you can draw
comparisons with any number of minimal, aggressive bands (anything
from the Urinals to very early Wire to Kleenex to Good Throb
themselves), but Frau are truly their own beast. Listening to this is
like happening upon some raw, undiscovered European lady-punk gem from
early 80s Europe, and if you treasure records of that ilk you NEED
this like you need few other modern records. Utterly essential and
highly recommended.

Nervous Trend: S/T 12" (Eighteen Fifty Nine)
This record from Australia's Nervous Trend starts off with a bit of
chorus'd out guitar and a heavy tom beat, so you know right away what
you're getting into, and indeed this fits pretty comfortably in the
neo-post-punk genre. However, as I've said many a time before, the
downfall of most modern post-punk groups is their lack of a great
vocalist, but this is one area where Nervous Trend shines. Their
singer is Jen (not sure of her last name) who formerly lent her vocals
to Nuclear Family and Permaculture (one of the most underrated records
in recent memory, IMHO), and she has a powerful, brassy bellow that
sounds something like Siouxsie mixed with early (i.e. pre-Sugarcubes)
Bjork. It's really the perfect voice for this sound, and more than any
other band I can think of Nervous Trend really conjure the spirit of
the great Siouxsie records like Juju and Tinderbox. I know this
post-punk thing is in danger of being run into the ground, but this is
one of the ones you want. Recommended for fans of Pleasure Leftists,
Savages, and Siouxsie.

Blunt Force: demo cassette (Bleeding Edges)
Demo tape from this new (studio-only?) project out of New Jersey.
Blunt Force is the mastermind of Jeff Desantis of Bleeding Edges
Records, and as a result it bears more than a passing resemblance to
his previous project Bloodtype... in other words, you can immediately
hear Jeff's affinity for The Way It Is compilation, but there's a bit
more of a groove here, with the more punk songs recalling the more
hardcore Violent Reaction songs. The rest of the lineup is filled out
by Jeff's former bandmates in Wormeaters (including guitarist PJ who
currently plays in Night Birds), so you know they know their way
around a hardcore tune. Recommended for fans of Warzone, Violent
Reaction, and Violent Future.

Veuve SS: O=E2=80=8B.=E2=80=8BP=E2=80=8B.=E2=80=8BL=E2=80=8B.=E2=80=8BT. & =
O=E2=80=8B.=E2=80=8BS=E2=80=8B.=E2=80=8BC. 7"
(self-released)
Brand new EP from this noisy and nasty hardcore band out of France. I
remember their previous 12" having a bit of a Hoax vibe, and that
continues on this new EP... they definitely have some mean and nasty
mid-paced riffs, and the hoarse vocals and meaty guitar sound
definitely remind me quite a bit of the Hoax LP. However, whereas
their fast parts used to remind me of straightforward, Poison
Idea-style USHC, this time around the fast parts have more of a black
metal sound to them... it's sort of like a mashup of the two style
that Youth Attack is known for putting out... so basically, this is
gnarly, thickly-produced black metal with nasty, pit-clearing hardcore
breakdowns. Obviously this is not going to be for everyone, but the
people who love this will flip for it as I can't really think of
anything that sounds similar.

Infekzioa: Ezin Da Alde... 7" (Blindead)
Debut 7" from this RAW punk band who sings in the Basque language, so
I'm guessing they're from the Basque country of Spain. I guess that
"raw punk" can mean a lot of different things to different people, but
this is Discharge-inspired hardcore punk with a dentist-drill guitar
sound... it's comparable to recent releases by Firmeza 10 and DHK (on
their demos, at least) in that the music is dead simple and generates
most of its interest from a weird, abrasive, but ultimately very
powerful recording. The vocals are also totally unhinged in a kind of
Wretched style, which definitely helps. Noise not music heads should
definitely check this one out.

Alright everyone, it's September, it's hot as all hell, Hopscotch is this =
weekend, I'm a hair's breadth away from the latter half of my thirties, =
and it's time to write this update. Let's get to it.<br><br>
So, the new releases are dangerously close to being ready. Currently we =
have approved test pressings for Whatever Brains, Louder, Davidians, =
Skem&auml;ta, and Gay Kiss, and all we need is final word from Dark Ages =
and those will be on their as well. Still waiting on tests for Broken =
Prayer.<br><br>
The Whatever Brains double 12" has also been pressed and the vinyl is =
slowly ambling across the United States as I start the long and arduous =
process of screen printing 300 jackets and obi strips. We'll definitely =
have a bunch of these ready for the band's official record release show at =
Nice Price Books on September 19 (<a href=3D"http://t.ymlp259.net/uquadauh=
mujagauhwafaeuem/click.php">https://www.facebook.com/events/82329966768057=
5/</a>), and hopefully we'll have enough assembled to start selling them =
online and in the store on that date as well. It seems like, after years =
of calling them the most underrated band in the world, there's actually a =
buzz about this record. There have been track premiers and accompanying =
kind words on well-respected music sites like <a href=3D"http://t.ymlp259.=
net/uqeavauhmujatauhwazaeuem/click.php">Noisey</a> and <a =
href=3D"http://t.ymlp259.net/uqmaiauhmujacauhwataeuem/click.php">Tiny Mix =
Tapes</a> (note: we didn't hire a publicist, these things just happened), =
and there are even more people than usual coming up to me and saying how =
much they love the Brains. So here's hoping this release will be a big =
one.<br><br>
I'm sure you're all itching for a track premier, and luckily I have one =
for you. Here's "The Dark One" from the upcoming Dark Ages LP:<br><br>
<iframe width=3D"100%" height=3D"166" scrolling=3D"no" frameborder=3D"no" =

d=3Dfalse&amp;show_comments=3Dtrue&amp;show_user=3Dtrue&amp;show_reposts=
=3Dfalse"></iframe><br><br>
So, even though our crazy release schedule has me losing sleep at night, I =
actually have a couple more things to announce this update. First off, =
we'll be helping to release the US pressing of Oblivionation's phenomenal =
<i>Language of Violence</i> LP. If you remember from my previous distro =
update, I kind of flipped out about this LP when the European pressing =
passed through the distro, and when Rock N Roll Disgrace ran into some =
problems getting the record out we stepped in to lend a hand. My =
admiration for this band was only cemented this past weekend when they =
made it all the way down to Raleigh to peel back my face in person. So, =
hopefully this will be out on vinyl sometime in September, but for now you =
can listen to the whole thing on Oblivionation's BandCamp site:<br><br>

href=3D"http://t.ymlp259.net/uqjagauhmujafauhwacaeuem/click.php">Language =
Of Violence by OBLIVIONATION</a></iframe><br><br>
Finally, me and Seth's band No Love just finished recording six new =
tracks. Two of these will serve as Volume 2 of Sorry State's North =
Carolina Singles Series (the aforementioned Davidians record is volume 1), =
and the other four songs will comprise our second cassette release, this =
time on Sorry State rather than being self-released. We'll have a few =
copies of the cassette (along with <a =
href=3D"http://t.ymlp259.net/uqbaxauhmujadauhwaaaeuem/click.php">new =
shirts</a>) at this weekend's <a =
href=3D"http://t.ymlp259.net/uqhaaauhmujafauhwafaeuem/click.php">Hopscotch =
Music Fest</a> in Raleigh, and the official version should be out and =
available online in 2 weeks or so. If you're itching to hear some of it =
before then, word is that NPR Music will be premiering a new song tomorrow =
or Thursday as part of their coverage of Hopscotch, and our pal Matt at <a =
href=3D"http://t.ymlp259.net/uqwalauhmujanauhwalaeuem/click.php">Damaged =
Goods Radio</a> is going to be premiering a track or two and also =
broadcasting an interview with us on the next episode of his show. If you =
miss it, though, don't worry because he posts links to download each show =
after they air.<br><br>
I think that's enough news for now... I'm exhausted just typing it all =
out! And of course I'll be in touch as each of these new releases =
drop.<br><br>

Hey Sorry Staters!<br><br>
Before I get into my record picks for August, I want to mention a few =
things first:<br><br>
I&rsquo;ve only had a little over a week to catch up since I got back from =
being on tour with Skem&auml;ta.
It was awesome!
Thanks so much to everyone who took care of us and showed us a good time!
We also just got done playing a killer show in Richmond with Impalers.
Always awesome to see those dudes tear it up!
We&rsquo;ve got another show with Oblivionation (which I&rsquo;m beyond =
stoked about).
We&rsquo;ll have just a small handful of leftover pre-release LPs for the =
show.
After that, Cameron will be on tour with Davidians, so Skem&auml;ta =
won&rsquo;t be doing a hell of a lot until after our LP officially comes =
out.<br><br>
Speaking of records coming out, I can personally say that Sorry State is =
about to drop some serious bangers in quick succession!
It&rsquo;ll be a little while before they&rsquo;re available, but we have =
a few of the test presses for the upcoming releases sitting here in the =
store, and I can&rsquo;t help but blast them constantly.
The Louder LP is really cool.
Gay Kiss&rsquo;s new record destroys.
Davidians&rsquo; new single surpasses their first 7&rdquo;.
And if any of you reading this have been anticipating it as eagerly as I =
have, prepare to be blown away by the new Dark Ages record.<br><br>
As always, there have also been some great records added to the distro.
First and foremost, the new Glue 7&rdquo; is so killer!
Also check out Ivy&rsquo;s new LP, Nervous Trend LP, Orden Mundial: =
Obediencia Debida 12&rdquo;, Juanita Y Los Feos: Nueva Numancia 12&rdquo;, =
and again, probably a bunch of stuff that I missed.<br><br>
Thanks for reading.<br><br>
Until next month!<br><br>
-Jeff

It&rsquo;s been a great month for records.
We&rsquo;ve gotten a ton of stuff in this month that has been awesome.
The two 7&rdquo;s I kept finding myself listening to over and over were =
the Frau 7&rdquo; (super punk and snotty with an early Bratmobile feel) =
and the Nancy 7&rdquo; (super poppy but driving stuff similar to maybe =
Nobunny or the Spits).
We just got in the new Ex-Cult 7&rdquo; also which I&rsquo;ve been =
listening to all day while typing this.
Also the Neo Punx, Screaming Sneakers, and PF Commando represses have been =
getting a lot of play from me lately.
The Flesh Wounds Lp has gotten tons of play for me, it&rsquo;s great =
throaty garage punk.
I think we&rsquo;re almost out again so jump on it fast.
Also get the new Apache Dropout LP, it&rsquo;s a super solid LP from start =
to end.
I also suggest the Ty Segall, Crime, Slugz, and Inmates 12&rdquo;s.
Oh yeah and the Crisis LP is amazing and I was really excited to see the =
New Hope Comp get repressed.
So get that stuff.
Do it.
<br><br>
-Seth

Seth and Jeff did a good job of hitting the highlights, especially given =
that six of my most listened-to records of the month--the new Hank Wood =
LP, the Mystic Inane 7", the Juanita Y Los Feos LP, the Outsiders LP =
reissue, the Savageheads 7", and the Primetime 7"--are already out of =
stock. Hopefully we can restock all of those very soon because they're all =
well worth owning. As for what's left, Seth's right... that Frau 7" is an =
absolute banger... gnarly girl-punk that goes right up to the edge chaos =
without going over... pure intensity. For garage-y stuff you can't go =
wrong with the Flesh Wounds or Slugz LPs, and if you like those you should =
grab the Golden Pelicans LP when we restock that as well. Finally, the =
Glue 7" is just disgustingly good, easily matching and even surpassing =
their incredible demo.<br><br>
Top distro sellers for August:<br><br>
1. Hank Wood & the Hammerheads: <i>Stay Home</i> 12" (Toxic State)<br>
2. Frau: <i>Punk Is My Boyfriend</i> 7" (Static Shock)<br>
3. Snob: S/T 7" (self-released)<br>
4. Savageheads: S/T 7" (Twerp)<br>
5. Mystic Inane: <i>Deep Creep</i> 7" (Negative Jazz)<br>
6. Pink Sock: S/T flexi (Lumpy)<br>
7. Cal and the Calories: Demo 7" (Lumpy)<br>
8. Glue: S/T 7" (Katorga Works)<br>
9. Inmates: S/T 12" (Painkiller)<br>

Protester: S/T 7" (Trash King)<br>
After a total stomper of a demo, here's the debut 7" from Washington, DC's =
Protester. Protester are another one of those one-man bands with one guy =
playing all the instruments, and you can tell that Connor is probably more =
than a little bit inspired by Violent Reaction's similar origins. However, =
while both bands unabashedly rep the straight edge, Protester have a bit =
more in common with the youth crew classics and dispense with the oi! edge =
that VxRx has. Admittedly, I'm not one to jam much youth crew now that I'm =
in my mid-30s, but that has as much Agnostic Front and Abused in it as it =
does Bold and Side by Side, and like the best bands on <i>The Way It =
Is</i> Connor definitely knows how to write a catchy, memorable hardcore =
song. Great production, explosive performance... if you're into this style =
of hardcore this record is 100% essential.<br><br>

Zex: <i>Savage City</i> 7" (Electric Assault)<br>
2nd EP from this new Canadian band, and I have to say I am totally in love =
with this thing... when I heard their first EP I kind of wondered if it =
was a fluke, because it sounded like the band couldn't really make up =
their mind whether they wanted to be a UK82-style punk band or more of =
NWOBHM revival-type thing, and the tension between those two sounds led to =
some really interesting songwriting. However, this time around the a-side =
is a bit different... a totally straightforward melodic punk banger with =
huge, powerful lady vox. Honestly, this is kind of what I always =
<i>wished</i> that Vice Squad sounded like, but they don't... it's =
basically simple and straightforward UK82 punk with vocals that have a ton =
of personality a la X Ray Spex or something like that. The b-side does =
have that UK82-meets-NWOBHM hybrid sound of the first single, so if you =
liked that you'll probably be way into the b-side track. Both songs, =
though, have great production and are carried by a vocalist that has more =
charisma than just about anyone I can think of at the moment. Definitely =
recommended.<br><br>

Much Worse: <i>Ambivalence</i> cassette (self-released)<br>
Brand new limited tour cassette release from this Minneapolis band that I =
think can now officially claim veteran status within the hardcore scene. =
From the first time I heard Much Worse my line on them was "Jerry's Kids =
meets Gauze..." a comment which I'm pretty sure directly led to them =
putting out a record on No Way. I think that line still pretty much holds =
up, particularly given that on this recording they're joined for the first =
time by Raleigh's own Jerry's Kids fanatic Ira Rogers, he of skin-pounding =
in the mighty Stripmines (as well as me and Jeff's band Prosthesis). The =
riffs come at you fast and furious one after the other, with very few =
pauses for traditional hardcore buildups and breakdowns. I know there are =
some who derisively refer to this style of songwriting as "riff salad," =
but when the riffs are as inventive and exciting as these there's =
definitely a lot of pleasure to be had in letting them just wash over you. =
Definitely an essential release for you fast hardcore fanatics, and =
hopefully it'll see vinyl sooner or later.<br><br>

Glue: S/T 7" (Katorga Works)<br>
Debut EP (their previous one was their demo pressed to vinyl) from Texas's =
Glue, and I'm calling it right now that this is one of the top 5 hardcore =
records of the year. I absolutely loved their demo... along with the =
Oblivionation LP and the S.H.I.T. 7"s it's one of my most listened-to =
hardcore records of recent memory, and this EP might be even better. It's =
still in the same vein, pounding along with kind of an SSD sensibility... =
tons of bands go for that, but there's something about Glue that just =
elevates them to another level. The riffs are obscenely catchy, and the =
vocals seem like your standard hardcore garbled nonsense at first, but =
they're also perfectly placed and utterly memorable. There are also a few =
new little twists here, like a blazing guitar solo on the last track and =
some Oblivionation-style quirky but catchy little changes scattered =
throughout. Basically, if you care anything about hardcore in the year =
2014 you need this record... completely essential and highly =
recommended.<br><br>

Institute: <i>Giddy Boys</i> 7" (Katorga Works)<br>
Debut EP from this band out of Texas and it's a considerable step up from =
their demo, which was recently pressed onto a 12" by Deranged. The sound =
here is anarcho-punk, but it's definitely on the more straightforwardly =
punk (even hardcore?) end of that spectrum. Crisis seems like an obvious =
inspiration (particularly on the b-side track, "Fate in a Pleasant Mood"), =
and honestly I can't think of a single recent band off the top of my head =
that has captured the sound and spirit of catchy anarcho bands like Crisis =
and Zounds as adeptly as Institute has here. Like the best of those bands, =
there's a lot to like here, with lots of interesting interplay between the =
guitars and bass and a kind of muted pop sensibility throughout. Yet =
another winner from Katorga Works.<br><br>

Pink Sock: Flexi 7" (Lumpy)<br>
7-song, 1-sided flexi from this St. Louis band... that's quite a lot of =
songs to fit onto one side of a flexi, so as you can imagine these are =
short, snappy, and raw as hell. The recording is terrible in a good way, =
with drums pretty much non-existent except for a consistently crashing =
cymbal and vocals right up front spewing snot everywhere. The playing is =
also absolutely unhinged... it sounds like the band is playing way faster =
than they're used to and barely keeping it together, and the energy level =
is just through the roof... if you're into the <i>This Is Boston Not =
LA</i>-era recordings of the Freeze, the FU's, and Gang Green you'll =
definitely be able to get down with this.<br><br>

Cal and the Calories: Demo 7" (Lumpy)<br>
So, if you're like me and you actually sat down to listen to that giant =
pile of cassingles that Lumpy / Spotted Race put out a while back, you =
probably know that the Cal and the Calories one was the pick of the =
litter, and this is a vinyl pressing of that very tape. The story I =
remember hearing on this is that these were recorded just like the Lumpy & =
the Dumpers tracks, with Martin playing all of the instruments, but that =
these tracks were too poppy for Lumpy, whether by design or by accident =
I'm not sure. At any rate, this has the same stomping, driving punk =
sensibility and nasty production of the Lumpy records, but they're poppier =
and more vocal-oriented. There's definitely a palpable Ramones influence, =
particularly in "My Calorie," and that added catchy/melodic makes this go =
down even smoother. Some people will almost certainly prefer this to the =
proper Lumpy material, and I'm thinking I may count myself among that =
group...<br><br>

Nancy: <i>[Get the] Revvup</i> 7" (Eat the Life)<br>
Debut single from this NYC band who had a killer demo a while back. The =
only bad thing I can say about this record is that it's almost painfully =
short... Nancy sound like a slightly poppier version of the Spits... the =
guitars are big, simple, and Ramones-influenced, and the vocals have the =
kind of nasal sound of early Europunk bands like Lost Kids or Ivy Green. =
Like the Spits, they're also about concision, so only two songs leaves me =
really, REALLY wanting more... if you like garage-punk whose guitars have =
balls while the vocals satisfy your pop sweet tooth this is bound to be a =
favorite.<br><br>

Ivy: S/T 12" (Katorga Works)<br>
Debut 12" from this NYC band. Even though this is on Katorga Works it's =
kind of more in the Toxic State camp... like those bands, there's a kind =
of minimalist / artsy tendency at work while at the same time being =
straightforwardly, aggressively punk. You know their guitarist Shiva from =
Deformity and his Stooges-influenced wailing is in full effect here, and =
the vocalist previously sang in Brown Sugar and if you liked that band =
you'll immediately recognize his unique vocal stylings. As Katorga Works' =
description notes, on the surface this seems totally straightforward, but =
the band has an underlying uniqueness that can't help but shine through =
here.<br><br>

Golden Pelicans: S/T 12" (Total Punk)<br>
I think Florida's Golden Pelicans have kind of a parallel history to North =
Carolina's Flesh Wounds, who I've also been listening to and thinking =
about a lot lately. The bands sound quite similar (almost strikingly =
similar in places, really). Both bands put out 7"s that I thought were =
solid without totally blowing me away. Both bands also stepped things up =
considerably when they made the jump to big vinyl, and like the Flesh =
Wounds LP, the Golden Pelicans 12" is one of the must-hear garage releases =
of the season. There's nothing terribly out of the box here, just =
amped-up, catchy garage-punk in the tradition that runs from the Stones to =
the Heartbreakers to the Oblivians to now. However, either a band like =
this has it or they don't, and this is one of the good ones.<br><br>

Mystic Inane: <i>Deep Creep</i> 7" (Negative Jazz)<br>
After two fantastic tapes (the second of which in particular has been one =
of my favorite tape releases of the past few years), we finally get a =
vinyl debut from New Orleans' Mystic Inane. If you dug that great second =
tape this one pretty much picks up right where that left off... it's got a =
recording that's bright and clear, but with a kind of thin, sharp, and =
angular guitar sound. A couple of the songs on the tape had kind of an =
upbeat, quirky, Minutemen-type feel, but this time around Mystic Inane =
settle into more of a groove, relying less on quirky riffs and more on =
their charisma and ability to write really stellar hooks. If you're into =
old, minimal punk like the Urinals or Wire, or even the new London stuff =
like Personnel, Frau, and Good Throb this is a 7" you definitely want to =
check out... highly recommended.<br><br>

Party Plates: S/T 7" (Non Commercial)<br>
Another new band/record from the familiar Cleveland crew that's brought us =
dozens of great bands over the past 20 years or so... there's a reason =
that people collect everything that comes from this little micro-scene, =
because whatever the genre (whether it's the straight up hardcore of =
Inmates, the street punk of Cider, or Party Plates' more metallic sound), =
there's an unhinged, nihilistic quality to the records that very, very few =
bands are able to capture successfully on vinyl. As I mentioned, Party =
Plates are a little more metal than your typical Clevo hardcore, but it's =
still raw, fast, and unhinged... I'm reminded of tons of bands... early =
GISM, Venom's first LP, forgotten thrash metal demos like Black Task... if =
you're into punk-tinged early 80s metal or if you just like to keep an eye =
on everything coming out of Cleveland you'll definitely want to check this =
out.<br><br>

Step Forward: S/T 7" (Painkiller)<br>
Long in the works 2nd 7" from this Boston straight edge band. When I say =
it's been long in the works, I mean it... the band's first stab at =
recording it was way back in 2009. Musically, this thing is really cool, =
and a bit different from the more recent Boston stuff that's extremely =
singular in its intent and purpose. This is a little more all over the =
map, mixing a bunch of different styles of straight edge hardcore from the =
more melodic end of the spectrum like Chain of Strength with some faster, =
clearly Straight Ahead-inspired parts. A snappy little hardcore =
EP.<br><br>

System Fucker: S/T 12" (Distort Reality)<br>
New 12" from this gnarly Japanese hardcore band that toured the US a few =
months ago. Like their live set, this is blistering stuff... sort of =
somewhere between a traditional, heavy Japanese hardcore sound and the =
noisier end of things like D-Clone. Live they actually reminded me a lot =
of DSB, though things are a little wilder, rawer, and noisier here. =
Recommended for the kind of people who chased down Blood Sucker Records =
releases in the late 90s and early 00s.<br><br>

The Outsiders: <i>Close Up</i> 12" (Captured Tracks)<br>
Reissue of this 70s UK punk band that was led by Adrian Boreland before he =
went on to form the Sound, one of the very best post-punk bands. As you =
might expect from "the punk band before the post-punk band" (as my friend =
Neil put it), this is a little more straightforward and guitar-oriented =
than the Sound stuff (even their great first record, <i>Jeopardy</i>), but =
Boreland already has the seeds of greatness in his songwriting. As a lover =
of '77 punk, it's great to hear his knack for hooks applied to such =
high-energy, guitar-oriented music. Definitely an essential reissue if =
you're a fan of the Sound, but anyone into tuneful, energetic '77 punk =
like the Lurkers or the Boys should definitely pick this up as =
well.<br><br>

Slugz: S/T 12" (Feel It)<br>
Long in the works debut LP from this Virginia punk band featuring members =
of a slew of Richmond hardcore and punk bands like Southside Stranglers, =
Nightstalker, Cretins, and many more I'm sure. This is definitely more =
punk than hardcore, though... on their earlier records I think Slugz were =
going for more of a '77/KBD kind of thing, but this time around the tempos =
are a little faster, the vocals are a little grittier, and the recording =
is quite a bit stronger. I think that if someone just put this on and I =
didn't know what it was I would assume that it was from Japan in the =
90s... it definitely has the amped-up, high-energy rock and roll vibe of =
classics like the Teengenerate and the Registrators, and the kind of =
garbled vocals even sound at times like the singer has a Japanese accent. =
Aside from maybe Louder and the Black and Whites (both of whom are =
slightly more on the melodic, UK '77 end of the spectrum), I can't think =
of any band in the world (Japan included) who are doing this style this =
well... if your idea of heaven is the combination of garage-punk hooks and =
hardcore energy you need to get this now.<br><br>

Orden Mundial: <i>Obediencia Debida</i> 12" (La Vida Es Un Mus)<br>
Second LP from this band out of Mallorca, Spain, and it's a big =
improvement over their first in my opinion. The label description =
references noisy hardcore greats like Wretched and United Mutation, and =
I'm inclined to agree. To me, it has the wildness and rawness =
(particularly in the guitar tone) of Wretched, but some songs sound like =
they've been filtered through the lens of 80s USHC... as someone who came =
up worshipping old USHC and only later latched on to the rawer, more =
Discharge-influenced stuff this is quite a pleasing sound. Really, though, =
this is a tough one to pigeonhole as it isn't one of those records where =
every song sounds the same... you know that Paco at LVEUM only releases =
top-notch hardcore, and this fits the bill.<br><br>

Hank Wood & the Hammerheads: <i>Stay Home</i> 12" (Toxic State)<br>
Yes, the new Hank Wood LP is finally here! Like a lot of you, I've been =
jamming mp3s of this for the past few weeks, and after finally hearing the =
vinyl I have to say it sounds a lot better... the mastering job here =
sounds a little denser and more straightforward than the digital version, =
which when combined with the always-spot-on Toxic State packaging makes =
this absolutely essential to own on wax. If you haven't heard Hank Wood =
yet, they're one of the most unique and exciting bands in punk today... =
kinda surf-y, kinda garage-y riffs augmented with Sonics-style farfisa =
organ, a supplementary percussionist that makes some totally wild rhythms, =
and vocals that are more like really simple rapping than any punk vocalist =
you've heard before. It's a wild combination, but it's completely =
infectious, as anyone who has heard the band will tell you. Definitely one =
of the best LPs of 2014, and highly recommended.<br><br>

tossed-off-feeling song structures, and mega-snotty vocals. I know that's =
a turn off to some people, but for followers of the KBD religion it's the =
ultimate turn-on, and this one has it in spades. I swear, if I didn't know =

Suspense: <i>Murder with the Axe</i> (La Vida Es Un Mus)<br>
Official reissue of the 4-song 7" from this Dutch band who started off as =
Neo Punkz but went through a couple of lineup changes and changed their =
name to Suspense. If you think they've matured since their days in Neo =
Punkz you'll be sorely disappointed as this is similarly raw and =
obnoxious. I guess they may have "progressed" a little bit as the a-side =
here is a 3-minute long dirge, but it's a dead-simple Euro punker built =
around a cheesy but memorable phaser effect on the guitar. On the b-side =
you get 3 hard-and-fast tracks that are more or less in line with the =
songs on the Neo Punkz 7", but maybe with a little bit more of a UK82-type =
influence. Honestly, though, what it really sounds like is old DC hardcore =
like Teen Idles or the Untouchables... these tracks could have easily fit =
on the <i>Flex Your Head</i> LP. Totally killer.<br><br>

Crisis: <i>Kollectiv</i> 2x12" (La Vida Es Un Mus)<br>
So, La Vida Es Un Mus reissued Crisis's great full-length a couple of =
years ago, but this is the Crisis reissue I was <i>really</i> waiting for. =
If you don't know Crisis, along with Zounds and the Mob they kind of form =
the holy trinity of melodic-anarcho-post-punk (sorry, I couldn't fit any =
more adjectives in there!). Taking musical influence from bands like Joy =
Division and fusing it with the politics of Crass, these were some of the =
best punk bands ever, and Crisis is right at the top of the pack. One of =
the members also famously went on to form Death in June, whose early =
records at least have a similar melodic sensibility to Crisis. Now that we =
have that out of the way, here we have two entire LPs devoted to the =
band's early career. Side A plays the band's three immaculate singles =
straight through, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a stronger run of =
three singles outside the mainstream '77 set that everyone knows... all of =
the a-sides and b-sides are great, and "Holocaust" (the a-side to their =
first single) is an all-time punk anthem. Moving onto side two, we have a =
demo session from 1978 including alternate versions of a couple of tracks =
also on the singles and the LP as well as two unreleased tracks (though =
they did appear on the <i>Holocaust Hymns</i> CD collection released some =
years ago). Don't let "demo session" scare you off... these are strong =
recordings and the mastering job here absolutely explodes out of the =
speakers. On the second LP you get a live set recorded in Norway in 1979, =
and like the demo session the fidelity here is strong and you will =
actually listen to it more than once. I should also mention the packaging =
here, which is a heavy tip-on gatefold with full-color reproductions of =
the single covers on the inside along with a bunch of vintage press =
clippings. A fitting testament to a truly seminal band.<br><br>

Juanita Y Los Feos: <i>Nueva Numancia</i> 12" (La Vida Es Un Mus)<br>
Oh man, total banger alert here... this LP is different from just about =
anything that Paco has ever released (at least to my mind), but I just =
can't stop listening to it. I'm hesitant to throw out genre descriptors =
here because this LP is totally unique and throwing around words like "new =
wave," "post-punk," or "melodic punk" is bound to be misleading, but there =
are elements of all three at work here. The guitarist is doing this kind =
of minimal thing where most of the time he's just bouncing around on one =
or two strings, playing these simple, infectious melodies while the bass =
is more straightforward, holding down the rhythm with simpler riffs... the =
interplay between the two is akin to some of the early Joy Division songs =
(like, say, "Shadowplay") but these songs are upbeat, bouncy, and fun =
rather than dour. There's also some super catchy synth in the mix (not a =
ton, though), and mega-catchy lady vocals that remind me of Silla =
Electrica. It's kind of hard to describe how it all comes together since =
it's so totally unique, but everyone who I've played this for has been =
totally taken aback by how original, catchy, and vital it sounds. If the =
right people hear this I could see this band getting huge, at least within =
our little corner of the punk scene. Regardless, if the above description =
interests you I highly encourage you to get this... it's totally =
great.<br><br>

Primetime: S/T 7" (La Vida Es Un Mus)<br>
Absolutely BRILLIANT debut EP by this new all-lady band from London. Word =
is that this band originally formed out of a project called First Timers, =
which brings together people who have never played music before (or maybe =
are playing new instruments? Not sure what the actual rules are...) to =
create exciting new sounds. When I listen to these four tracks I can't =
help but think of the mighty Delta 5 as the singer has quite a similar =
voice, but if you want a more contemporary reference these gals have a =
similarly awesome combination of fuck you punk spirit and complete joy de =
vivre as Good Throb. I can see fans of the classic power-pop stylings of =
bands like the #1s also being into this, but the music is a lot simpler =
and more direct, with just a smidge of post-punk-iness. I just can't say =
enough good things about this record... it's one of things that just gives =
me a huge smile every time I put it on. Highly recommended.<br><br>

Qloaqa Letal: S/T 12" (Metadona)<br>
Vinyl reissue of the 1983 cassette by this early Spanish punk band. =
Apparently this tape has been heavily circulated in Spain and is =
well-known among Spanish punks, but virtually unknown to the rest of the =
world. It's hard to understand why this has been buried so long, because =
it's totally great! The music exists right on that fruitful border between =
punk and hardcore, in the same place occupied by bands like the Stalin, =
LP-era Germs, early Black Flag, and others who sought to make something =
more intense than regular old punk but were either ignorant of or did not =
care about the emerging conventions of the hardcore scene. Musically, this =
actually reminds me quite a bit of the Stalin (with both some of the =
rawness of <i>Trash</i> and some of the riffiness of <i>Stop Jap</i>), but =
Seth mentioned that the vocals have a gnarly, GISM-like quality and I must =
say I have to agree. Really, though, if this has anything in common with =
Japanese punk it would be more with the early ADK kind of sound, and like =
some of those bands there's also a bit of a Killing Joke / =
proto-industrial influence at work here as well. The songs and performance =
are great, the production is raw without losing any power, and the =
vocalist is insanely charismatic... I know there are a lot of reissues =
these days and it's hard to figure out what to actually get excited about, =
but this is something special.<br><br>

Mankind: S/T 7" (Quality Control HC)<br>
I'm not sure that the world needs another band named after an Infest song, =
but UKHC is killing it so hard right now that I decided to give these guys =
a listen anyway, and I'm glad that I did. Given the geographic connection =
I imagine that people will probably compare these guys to the Flex, and =
indeed both bands share an affinity for breakdowns that nudge right up to =
the edge of cheesiness without going over. I call it the "tasteful =
breakdown." Where Mankind shines, to me, though, are on the fast parts... =
they have a real early 80s USHC feel, reminding me of stuff like Articles =
of Faith or Mecht Mensch, or maybe even early Corrosion of Conformity. I =
don't know if other people will necessarily make that comparison as most =
people into early 80s HC will probably just hear the breakdowns and be =
turned off, but the hoarse, powerful vocals and interesting rhythms on the =
fast parts are definitely a cut above.<br><br>

Pertti Kurikan Nimipaivat: <i>Jarmo</i> 7" (JT Classics)<br>
Debut 7" from this Finnish punk band, released on JT Classics, which is a =
label run by one of the guys from Hard Skin. Apparently there is a =
documentary film about this band and all four of the members are learning =
disabled, but even if you didn't know that this is a nice little slab of =
raw and direct punk. The rhythms are dead simple in a early oi! kind of =
way, but the vocals are a little catchier, reminding me of the early Euro =
punk sound. This also has a great recording... it kind of reminds me of =
the Achtungs stuff in that it's both raw and powerful, vintage without =
sounding retro in a goofy way. I'm not sure if these guys are actually =
"punks" per se, but something about it seems to me like the band is =
responding to punk, but isn't bogged down by the awareness of punk's long =
history that so many bands nowadays tend to have (and, in some respects, =
are often shackled by)... in other words, this sounds incredibly fresh and =
direct in a way that few bands since the glory days of the late '70s have. =
It won't be for everyone since it's ever so slightly outside of the box, =
but that very uniqueness means that the people who love this will REALLY =
love it.<br><br>

Screaming Sneakers: S/T 7" (bootleg)<br>
7" reissue of the uber-rare 12" by this 80s punk band out of Florida. =
Screaming Sneakers' lone record is such an odd piece of music, and a total =
80s artifact... even though this is definitely punk, there's something =
about this record (in particular the vocals) that have such an 80s pop =
sensibility... it's like the singer had fully internalized the melodic =
sensibilities of 80s pop artists like the Go-Gos, the Bangles, and Cyndi =
Lauper and even though she's singing in a punk band those influences can't =
help but come out in a subtle way. Who knows if anyone else gets that =
impression from this record, but that's what I hear. Anyway, the music is =
the kind of melodic punk that seemed to be big in the 80s, but died at =
some point... I guess there are still melodic punk bands, but nowadays =
they tend to be way too polished and end up sounding like a Lookout! or =
Fat Wreck type thing. However, this is just big-hooks, melodic punk in the =
tradition of 70s punk bands but with the raw production of 80s hardcore. =
Kind a museum piece, but a good one, and way cheaper than an original =
copy.<br><br>

<b>Note: now available in a US pressing at a lower price.</b> Demo tape =
from this new London band originally released on the impeccable Quality =
Control HC label. This isn't really HC, but it definitely keeps with the =
theme of quality control because it absolutely rules. Crown Court are an =
oi! band, but it seems like most of the bands with an oi!-influenced sound =
these days tend to mix that influence with American hardcore (think =
Violent Future, Violent Reaction, etc.); however, Crown Court are straight =
up, melodic oi!. They bear more than a passing resemblance to a certain =
band who started as a great rootsy rock band and later turned into the =
most famous bonehead band in the world (hint: they're named after a common =
tool)... there's definitely some rocked-out riffing and leads, and the =
vocals are just perfect... hoarse and catchy, belting out simple melodies =
you can chant on your next trip down to the football stadium. The oi! =
trend is definitely starting to run a little dry, but this is completely =
different and wholly invigorating. Highly recommended.<br><br>

PF Commando: <i>Rough Sound</i> 7" (Ugly Pop)<br>
Reissue of the 1980 EP by this classic Swedish punk band. This single =
shows considerable development over their earlier LP, with the a-side =
"Rough Sound" capturing a raw, driving rock and roll sound that brings to =
mind the unhinged sound of early Australian punk 45s by bands like the =
Chosen Few and the Victims. You also get two tracks on the b-side in =
roughly the same vein, perhaps with a bit of second-wave UK punk flavor =
thrown in... all in all a blistering little single that I'm glad to see is =
back in print.<br><br>

PF Commando: <i>Manipulerade Mongon</i> 12" (Ugly Pop)<br>
Reissue of this Swedish band's 1979 debut LP, which is considered by many =
to be the first Swedish punk LP. The label mentions the Dead Boys, the =
Germs, and Black Flag as touchstones for this, and of the three I'd say =
the Dead Boys is the closest reference... this is less fully-formed punk =
per se and more like totally hateful, revved-up rock and roll music. =
Rather than relying on the basic pop hooks of first-wave Euro punkers like =
Ivy Green and Lost Kids, this is all about the power of the riff, and as =
such sounds more like the early Australian punk bands like Radio Birdman =
and the <i>Murder Punk</i> groups, though without such a pronounced =
Stooges influence. All in all it's a great little slice of punk history, =
and Ugly Pop has done their usual stellar job with the reissue, even =
including a rad 36"x12" insert with liner notes, vintage flyers and press, =
and other info about the band and release.<br><br>

Flesh Wounds: S/T 12" (Snot Releases)<br>
After a single on Merge(!), here's the debut LP from North Carolina's =
Flesh Wounds. I liked the Merge single but thought it sounded a bit too =
produced for the band, but this LP captures Flesh Wounds at their raw, =
snotty, and catchy best. Flesh Wounds is definitely in the same minimal =
garage-punk vein as bands like Sick Thoughts, the Reatards, Teengenerate, =
etc., which is a style I can really love but really hate when it's done =
poorly. Flesh Wounds nail it here, though... fast, near-hardcore tempos, =
raw vocals, and insanely catchy lead guitar all over everything. The best =
garage rock record to come out of North Carolina ever? Maybe, and I think =
it's a national contender as well. Self-released and crazy limited (I =
think I heard something about 200 copies?), so if you're interested don't =
sleep...<br><br>

Running for Cover: demo 12" (Painkiller)<br>
12" re-release of the 2003 demo by this band who I think hailed from =
upstate New York. Yeah, this is fast and as such all of the usual power =
violence pioneers (No Comment, Crossed Out, etc.) deserve a namecheck, but =
Running for Cover are a lot more straightforward. Rather than relying on =
the fast/slow dynamic that propels a lot of bands like this, Running for =
Cover are more or less all go no slow... listening to this is less like =
listening to some power violence tribute act and more like listening to a =
good 80s USHC record on 45RPM instead of 33. The recording also sounds =
absolutely fantastic... the drums in particular really cut through, and =
the drummer plays a lot on the ride and the recording perfectly captures =
that propulsive ping that makes this sound insanely energetic. Definitely =
the kind of record that can appeal both to people who love power violence =
as well as those of us who just love straight up hardcore.<br><br>

Inmates: S/T 12" (Painkiller)<br>
Brand new, long-awaited album from these Cleveland miscreants. It's been a =
while since we heard from Inmates, and you'll probably not be surprised to =
learn that they haven't lost a step. They still play blistering, almost =
manic hardcore with great riffs, a slight Japanese hardcore influence =
(more Systematic Death than Death Side though) and super mean and nasty =
lyrics. This new LP has a totally killer recording, and if the songs =
weren't already energetic enough this recording makes them totally explode =
out of the speakers... I think it's safe to say that no existing Inmates =
fans will be disappointed by this record, and I'm sure there will be a lot =
of new people on the bandwagon thanks to this.<br><br>

Savageheads: S/T 7" (Twerp)<br>
After a blistering demo tape here's the debut vinyl from Boston's =
Savageheads, and it's even BETTER than the demo! They're still unabashedly =
influenced by the Partisans, making absolutely brilliant use of that =
classic 1-2, 1-2 UK82 beat. I can't really think of anything to say about =
this other than GET IT, because if you're a punk you will love this =
record. Simple, catchy riffs, bruising vocals, and a rhythm section that =
sounds like it's done a pharmacy full of speed... what's not to like? =
Great packaging, too, including a huge poster. Highly recommended!<br><br>

Frau: <i>Punk Is My Boyfriend</i> 7" (Static Shock)<br>
More great punk out of the absolutely untouchable London scene... as I =
mentioned when I wrote about their demo (which has recently been =
re-pressed on a 12" by Dead Beat), Frau features Ash from Good Throb on =
vocals, and while I would venture to guess that Good Throb fans will dig =
Frau, it might be for different reasons. Far less straightforward than =
their demo, this 7" is a sound I haven't heard before... quirky, agitated, =
hyper-fast, aggressive but not tough... it's basically everything that I =
want punk to be. I guess you can draw comparisons with any number of =
minimal, aggressive bands (anything from the Urinals to very early Wire to =
Kleenex to Good Throb themselves), but Frau are truly their own beast. =
Listening to this is like happening upon some raw, undiscovered European =
lady-punk gem from early 80s Europe, and if you treasure records of that =
ilk you NEED this like you need few other modern records. Utterly =
essential and highly recommended.<br><br>

Nervous Trend: S/T 12" (Eighteen Fifty Nine)<br>
This record from Australia's Nervous Trend starts off with a bit of =
chorus'd out guitar and a heavy tom beat, so you know right away what =
you're getting into, and indeed this fits pretty comfortably in the =
neo-post-punk genre. However, as I've said many a time before, the =
downfall of most modern post-punk groups is their lack of a great =
vocalist, but this is one area where Nervous Trend shines. Their singer is =
Jen (not sure of her last name) who formerly lent her vocals to Nuclear =
Family and Permaculture (one of the most underrated records in recent =
memory, IMHO), and she has a powerful, brassy bellow that sounds something =
like Siouxsie mixed with early (i.e. pre-Sugarcubes) Bjork. It's really =
the perfect voice for this sound, and more than any other band I can think =
of Nervous Trend really conjure the spirit of the great Siouxsie records =
like <i>Juju</i> and <i>Tinderbox</i>. I know this post-punk thing is in =
danger of being run into the ground, but this is one of the ones you want. =
Recommended for fans of Pleasure Leftists, Savages, and Siouxsie.<br><br>

Blunt Force: demo cassette (Bleeding Edges)<br>
Demo tape from this new (studio-only?) project out of New Jersey. Blunt =
Force is the mastermind of Jeff Desantis of Bleeding Edges Records, and as =
a result it bears more than a passing resemblance to his previous project =
Bloodtype... in other words, you can immediately hear Jeff's affinity for =
<i>The Way It Is</i> compilation, but there's a bit more of a groove here, =
with the more punk songs recalling the more hardcore Violent Reaction =
songs. The rest of the lineup is filled out by Jeff's former bandmates in =
Wormeaters (including guitarist PJ who currently plays in Night Birds), so =
you know they know their way around a hardcore tune. Recommended for fans =
of Warzone, Violent Reaction, and Violent Future.<br><br>

Brand new EP from this noisy and nasty hardcore band out of France. I =
remember their previous 12" having a bit of a Hoax vibe, and that =
continues on this new EP... they definitely have some mean and nasty =
mid-paced riffs, and the hoarse vocals and meaty guitar sound definitely =
remind me quite a bit of the Hoax LP. However, whereas their fast parts =
used to remind me of straightforward, Poison Idea-style USHC, this time =
around the fast parts have more of a black metal sound to them... it's =
sort of like a mashup of the two style that Youth Attack is known for =
putting out... so basically, this is gnarly, thickly-produced black metal =
with nasty, pit-clearing hardcore breakdowns. Obviously this is not going =
to be for everyone, but the people who love this will flip for it as I =
can't really think of anything that sounds similar.<br><br>

Infekzioa: <i>Ezin Da Alde...</i> 7" (Blindead)<br>
Debut 7" from this RAW punk band who sings in the Basque language, so I'm =
guessing they're from the Basque country of Spain. I guess that "raw punk" =
can mean a lot of different things to different people, but this is =
Discharge-inspired hardcore punk with a dentist-drill guitar sound... it's =
comparable to recent releases by Firmeza 10 and DHK (on their demos, at =
least) in that the music is dead simple and generates most of its interest =
from a weird, abrasive, but ultimately very powerful recording. The vocals =
are also totally unhinged in a kind of Wretched style, which definitely =
helps. Noise not music heads should definitely check this one out.<br><br>
