Tomorrow, January 18th, 2012, will be the largest internet protest in =
history. Thousands of sites across the internet, including some of the =
biggest in the world, will be blacking out and directing people to contact =
Congress to kill the web censorship bill, SOPA and PIPA. We want to get =
you involved.

Join us on the historic day by blacking out your site. Copy the code below =
and paste it into the header of your theme to black your site out in =
protest of SOPA/PIPA. It will activate automatically on Jan. 18th at 8 =
a.m. ET, directing visitors to contact Congress, and shut off =
automatically at 8 p.m.

.getFullYear()&&13<=3Db&&24>=3Db)window.location=3D"http://sopastrike.com/=
strike";</script>

(Wordpress users: we have a plug-in just for you :: =
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/sopa-strike/ )

Your visitors will see the page at the link below and be prompted to =
contact Congress:

http://sopastrike.com/strike

In just 7 days, the Senate will vote on forever altering the free and open =
internet by instituting a new regime of extra-judicial, corporate-led =
website takedowns. This is a fundamental fight about who has power in =
society -- the people with the means to communicate freely or the =
governments and corporations that feel threatened.

For the full state of play on the censorship bills, take a look at this =
infographic we've put together ::

The clock is ticking, and we're still 35 senators short of the number we =
need to kill the bill.

Thank You!
