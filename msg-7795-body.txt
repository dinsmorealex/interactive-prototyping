Label News

Alright folks, the big news is that the new Whatever Brains double 12"
is out now!

Here's the official description:

Whatever Brains have always been a band inclined toward the grand
statement, but their latest release reaches new levels of epic. Not a
conventional LP or a double LP, SSR-63/SSR-64 is actually two separate
EPs packaged as one. SSR-63 is a single 22-minute track spread across
both sides of a 45RPM 12". A series of linked compositions a la
Venom=E2=80=99s At War with Satan or the Subhumans=E2=80=99 From the =
Cradle to the
Grave, SSR-63=E2=80=99s lyrics chronicle the plight of a Russian family =
who
lived in complete isolation in remote Siberia for more than 40 years.
The music is similarly wide in scope, drifting organically from
maximalist punk to minimalist, country-tinged lament to pumping
electronica in an astoundingly natural fashion. As for the other
12=E2=80=9D, it=E2=80=99s a new 4-song EP called SSR-64, which continues =
to
develop the wide sonic palette that the best tracks on their previous
LP hinted at. SSR-64 also delivers =E2=80=9CUVOD,=E2=80=9D the closest =
thing to a
pop hit Whatever Brains have ever created. As ever, a good portion of
the people reading this will be confused and repulsed by the Whatever
Brains, while the remainder will insist vocally that this is one of
the most truly innovative and exciting records of 2014.

I should also mention the physical characteristics of this release,
because it=E2=80=99s one that you=E2=80=99re definitely going to want to =
own on
vinyl. First of all, we put a lot of effort (and money) into mastering
for this release, and the result is easily the best-sounding
(fidelity-wise, at least) record that Sorry State has ever produced.
Since we splurged on the sonics, we=E2=80=99ve done our best to keep the
price of this thing low with screen printed jackets made from recycled
materials. In a world of tossed-off, insta-file releases, holding
SSR-63/SSR-64 in your hands will make you realize why you still care
about vinyl.

Click here to check out SSR-64 on BandCamp. (

to 300 copies and are already going very fast.

I really can't say enough how excited I am for this to finally be
out... Whatever Brains continue to be so ahead of the game, making
some of the most unique, intense, and infectious music around. I've
said it before, but following this band closely feels like following
Husker Du or the Kinks or the Fall at their peak... each new release
is a total surprise that somehow manages to completely up the ante. If
you haven't paid attention before, I highly encourage you to get on
board now. And if you need to get caught up, we've put their previous
records (as well as a few others from related bands) on sale. Check
out the sale here:
http://www.sorrystaterecords.com/collections/whatever-brains-sale

That isn't the only release we have for you right now, though: me and
Seth's band No Love also has a new tape. Here's the info on that:

After an earlier self-released demo, Raleigh, North Carolina=E2=80=99s No
Love move to Sorry State proper for their second release. Dispensing
with some of the poppier tendencies of their demo, No Love play
fist-pumping melodic punk along the lines of the Buzzcocks, the
Avengers, and the Canadian Subhumans, occasionally augmented with the
sarcastic snap of bands like the Angry Samoans. Tape #2 contains four
new tracks recorded by Colin Swanson-White (Davidians), and the new
recording does a much better job of capturing the band=E2=80=99s dense
combination of melodic bass lines, dueling lead guitar and anthemic
vocals. Cassettes are professionally duplicated and come with a
digital download. Limited to 100 copies.

Check it out on BandCamp here:

These are also flying out the door, so don't sleep! We're really proud
of this new No Love stuff. We also recorded two other songs during the
same session and those will be our debut single as part of the Sorry
State NC Singles Series... that should be out in November probably.

One more thing for this update. While we've always been hesitant to
sell much used stuff online, with the store's first anniversary right
around the corner (hard to believe!), we decided it's high time to
start selling more online... plus our bins are completely full and we
need to move some stock. We've been steadily adding stuff to the used
section of the site (
http://www.sorrystaterecords.com/collections/used-records ) (which you
should check regularly since most of the time these don't show up in
the regular new products feed), and we're also having a big sale to
clear out some space in our overflowing 7" bins. Here's the info on
that:

In an effort to clear some space, we=E2=80=99re unloading tons of used =
7=E2=80=9Ds
that have been sitting here for a while. Since we want to get rid of
as many as possible, if you order 5 or more we=E2=80=99ll give you 10% =
off,
or if you order 10 or more you=E2=80=99ll get 20% off.

Feel free to combine orders from this list with an order from the
Sorry State Records web site.

International customers: we can ship about 15 7=E2=80=9Ds in a flat-rate
priority mailer. We can send 15 7=E2=80=9Ds to Canada for $20 or 15 =
7=E2=80=9Ds
anywhere else in the world for $24.

Please email your order to daniel@sorrystaterecords.com. We=E2=80=99ll =
pull
everything and get back to you with a total for everything that=E2=80=99s
still available.

Distro Update

And here's a list of everything in the distro so far this month... I'm
a bit behind on writing descriptions, so hopefully some of these will
have descriptions written by the end of the month. However, in the
meantime be sure to look at the "Other New Distro Items" section
because there's some killer stuff in there!

Featured Distro Items

Wipers: Nome Noma 7" (Meanbean)
Not to be confused with the much more famous Portland band of the
same name, Meanbean Records' debut release is a reissue of the 1980
single by this obscure Toronto punk band. I hadn't heard of this
before the reissue, which is surprising because this is a top-notch
early punk record from a city with a well-known scene. Maybe it was
that this record was a bit behind the times... by 1980 the original
'77 punk scene that this single owes its clearest sonic debt to was
dying out and making way for hardcore, of which you'll find none here.
However, if your idea of punk is bands like Teenage Head, the Pointed
Sticks, Lost Kids, Buzzcocks, etc., these two tracks will hit your
sweet spot. Definitely recommended for all of you '77 punk / KBD heads
out there.

Nightfell: The Ever Living Mourn 12" (Southern Lord)
Debut LP from this new Portland project featuring Todd from Tragedy /
His Hero Is Gone and Tim from Aldebaran/Mournful Congregation. If I
had to choose one adjective to describe this record it would certainly
be BLEAK. While I'm sure Tragedy fans can get down with this... after
all, Todd's songwriting style is definitely apparent and there's
something of Tragedy's epic sweep in nearly every track here, but it's
sort of like they took away all of the catchier, more anthemic aspects
of Tragedy and left all of the bleak dirginess. It's definitely more
metal, leaning toward a kind of blackened doom sound, but there's a
lot of Hellhammer's primitive, almost punk take on metal as well.
Apparently this project came out of the members dealing with a bunch
of tragedy and loss, and that definitely comes across in the music...
it's the kind of record you listen to alone, in the dark, when you're
pondering how much life sucks.

Brotherhood: Till Death 12" (Southern Lord)
So this was a bit of a surprise... I know that Southern Lord has been
re-releasing a bunch of 80s hardcore over the past few years, but I
didn't expect them to start mining the well of late 80s straight edge
/ youth crew obscurities. However, Southern Lord owner / Sunn O)))
guitarist Greg Anderson was the guitarist in Brotherhood, so I guess
it makes sense (though he isn't even the most famous Brotherhood
alumnus... bassist Nate Mendel went on to play in Foo Fighters(!)).
Anyway, I remember owning the old Crucial Response version of this LP
back in the day and sold it in a purge of nearly all of my old youth
crew records, but revisiting this years down the line it's actually
way more ripping than I remember. It's definitely of its time and
isn't really breaking the mold in any way, but it's a concise,
well-recorded, and powerful document of the sound and style. At their
best Brotherhood could approach the stop/start intensity of Straight
Ahead (as they do on the classic first track, "The Deal"), and they
also have a bit common with the post-Youth of Today generation of NYHC
/ CBGB bands... bands like Breakdown, Outburst, Sick of It All, etc.
At its core, though, this is pure youth crew straight edge, clearly
inspired by Youth of Today, Side by Side, Wide Awake, etc., and it's
as strong a take on that sound as you're going to find. I should also
mention that the packaging on this is extensive and awesome. The
jacket is on a very heavy stock, it comes with an obi strip, and (most
importantly) a very thick, full-color, 7"-size booklet that not only
reproduces the layout of the band's lone 7" EP, but also adds dozens
of great photographs that look like they were ripped straight from the
pages of Schism or Hardware. I'm not sure that, at the end of the day,
this is great music or anything, but if like me you only need to own a
handful of youth crew records this should be a strong contender for
being one of them.

Various: Maggot Minded cassette (Maggot Mind)
New pressing (I assume?) of this 2008 compilation featuring a number
of bands from Olympia, Seattle, and surrounding areas, including HIV,
Loose Change, Horrible, White Boss, Funerot, Sisters, and Sex/Vid.
Like a good regional tape comp should be, everything is raw,
straightforward, and to the point. Some of these bands went on to
bigger things and some didn't (obviously Sex/Vid is the standout band
here and indeed their tracks are the strongest), but I would hardly
describe the quality is uneven, and everything kind of has that weird,
slightly artsy vibe that Washington (particularly Olympia) bands
always seem to have. Maybe a curiosity, but releases like this are
really what hardcore and punk are all about.

Pusrad: Errare Est Humanum 12" (Dead Beat)
2nd 12" from this great Swedish band. I know that a lot of people
don't like Pusrad, and I guess that's understandable because their
sound is a little goofy. If you haven't heard them, the "gimmick" (if
you could call it that) is that the songs are VERY short (averaging
about 20 seconds) and are built around all of these super tight little
changes and stops and starts. It isn't particularly heavy, though, and
even though it's very fast it doesn't really sound like hardcore. It's
really sort of like an updated version of early Wire if they only did
songs like "Field Day for the Sundays" and "Surgeon's Girl." On the
surface it sounds like an incredibly limiting framework, but every
time a new Pusrad record comes out it astounds me how much they can do
within it. Listening to this is kind of exhausting because it goes by
fast, but there are so many great hooks that you can't help but play
the record over and over... I'm on my fourth or fifth consecutive
listen as I type this. I feel like every new Pusrad record has been
better than the last, and this continues that trend. Recommended.

Total Control: Typical System 12" (Iron Lung)
Man, this was one follow-up I was really nervous about hearing. Even
though I'd heard their early singles, Total Control's first LP still
seemed to come totally out of nowhere... the whole post-punk revival
was just starting to get off the ground and it seemed instantly to
raise the bar several notches. But then the single on Sub Pop was
good, but not really explosive, and in my opinion the songs on the
split 12" with the Oh Sees didn't really stick out that much either.
However, it's clear now that Total Control were saving themselves for
this record, because it's really incredible. The environment in 2014
is very different... everyone and their brother seems to have a
post-punk band, yet Total Control still feel miles ahead. The intro
track is a total scorcher, a blistering blast of Depeche
Mode-influenced electro pop that I think is easily the best track
they've done (particularly in this style) since "Paranoid Video." Over
the course of the LP the band moves so fluidly between so many
styles... krautrock, new wave, garage-punk, and the big closer "Safety
Net," which could almost be like U2 or something with its big,
triumphant melody. I've probably listened to this 30+ times since it
came out, and I don't see it getting old any time soon. A serious
contender for best LP of 2014, and needless to say it gets our highest
possible recommendation.

Ty Segall: Manipulator 2x12" (Drag City)
Sorry State has been carrying Ty Segall's records since back when we
couldn't give them away, and like a lot of people I always liked him a
lot but thought he was capable of just a little bit more. Well,
Manipulator is that more... reading the press leading up to this album
Segall talked a lot about how he took his time with this one and it
really shows. He used to bury his melodies in so much fuzz that it
took a lot of effort on the listener's part to pick them out (not to
mention the lofty task of wading through his huge discography), but on
this record everything is right up front, waiting to be loved.
Admittedly it's not as furious as some of his other stuff, but this
sort of rootsy glam sound (I'd compare it to records like Bowie's The
Man Who Sold the World or Lou Reed's Transformer) is such a great
framework for Segall and every song is a legit hit. This is a big
record and will likely be all over NPR, Pitchfork, etc. in the months
to come (and on those respective publications' year-end best-of lists
too, I'm sure), but it's legit enough for those of us in the
underground as well. Until he makes a better record, but position is
that this is the Ty Segall you want in your collection.

General Speech Omnibus Vol 2 zine
Latest "omnibus issue" that collects the best content from this
long-running fanzine. The content is really top-notch... the bands and
labels interviewed and profiled (including DiE, Criaturas, Discrete
Records, Terveet K=C3=A4det, Fracaso, and a big feature on current Mexican
punk) are almost all really interesting, and the interview questions
and general level of thought is much higher than your typical punk
fanzine. If you're a zine-lover this is pretty much a must-read.

Aborticido: S/T 7" (General Speech)
5-song 7" from this raw hardcore band out of Mexico. Actually,
there's one song title in Japanese and one in English in addition to
two in Spanish (and one in apparent nonsense?), so as you might expect
these guys seem to have a good handle on the worldwide hardcore
scene... this isn't some backwoods grindcore band or anything.
Interestingly, Aborticido seem to be inspired primarily by 80s
Japanese punk... they remind me of the noisier, harsher bands on the
ADK label, and the singer's kind of whiny, high-pitched scream
actually sounds a LOT like the vocalist of Aburadako, whose flexi is
one of my favorite Japanese records. Some of this record is total
blur-core, but they rock things out on the last track, "Esta Culero,"
and it's really almost a dead ringer for the Aburadako flexi... if you
want a less obscure reference it also sounds a bit like the Stalin.
Any way you cut it, though, this is a cool little EP with some rad
artwork. Limited to 250 copies.

Koward: Desperate 7" (Side Two)
Brand new 7" from this Boston band, and it's a ripper. I guess the
sound they're going for is the kind of straightforward, barreling,
Doom-inspired kind of thing, and they definitely have that going on
(and in that respect they actually sound a bit like Sorry State faves
No Tomorrow), but I think it's the other aspects of their sound that
really elevate Koward. The vocals are very hardcore... it sounds more
like the type of singing on like a Boston Strangler record or
something, and I can't overstate how great it is to hear a
crusty-sounding record without boring vocals. They also have a couple
of little musical tricks up their sleeve... a blazing guitar solo
here, a "Protest & Survive"-esque palm-muted part there... it's
definitely enough variation to keep this 7" snapping along.

Low Threat Profile: Product #3 7" (Six Weeks)
Latest EP from this band composed of power violence legends.
Interestingly, there isn't as much of that whiplash-inducing power
violence sound on this as you might expect... yes, it's very tight,
but in general the intricacy of the changes is de-emphasized here in
favor of a much more powerful, straightforward hardcore sound. Aside
from the obvious power violence parts, this just sounds like angry old
dude hardcore like Inmates or Out Cold or something like that. Who
knows if anyone outside the PV scene will give this a listen, but it's
a bruiser.

The Ukiah Drag: In the Reaper's Quarters 12" (Wharf Cat)
I'm really surprised no enterprising British music journalist has
named this little emerging scene of American indie/punk bands that
seems to coalescing at the moment. While there isn't really a cohesive
sound, there does seem to be something rather coherent in the
aesthetic of bands like Merchandise, Destruction Unit, Milk Music, the
Men, and Ukiah Drag (which, I guess, would make the definitive
document of this scene the recent 3-way split LP on 540 Records). Even
if they sound quite different, these bands share similar stories, with
members coming up through the DIY hardcore scene and growing to make
music that's a little bit more ambitious and refined. I guess that you
might distill it down to kids discovering their dad's Neil Young
records (something that's been going on at least since Dinosaur Jr),
but still there seems to be something unique about these bands, and at
moments they can make it feel like a genuinely exciting scene is
happening. Well, with this debut LP Ukiah Drag seem determined to take
their place at this table, bringing a sound that's equal parts the
Neil Young-isms of the later Men stuff, Merchandise's druggy haze, and
Destruction Unit's psychedelic forward lurch. However, the Ukiah
Drag's signature move seems to be the Gun Club-esque punk/blues vamp,
something that takes up a big part of the a-side of this LP and
definitely serves as a sort of sonic trademark. However, by the end of
the record you don't know what you're listening to anymore as it
devolves into the ambient hum of "Night of Immaculacy." This is an
ambitious, captivating LP, and I'm sure it'll be too "mature" or artsy
for some, but if you dig the aforementioned bands this definitely fits
into your scene for a reason.

The Gotobeds: Poor People Are Revolting 12" (12XU)
Debut 12" from this Pittsburgh band featuring former members of Kim
Phuc. Kim Phuc was a big, noisy, and nasty band, but Gotobeds are
something completely different. I figure they must be named after the
drummer from Wire, and indeed Wire seems like an obvious influence
here. The music is upbeat, bouncy, melodic, and built around a guitar
sound that's muscular but at the same time razor-thin and biting.
Really, though, what the Gotobeds remind me of are Parquet Courts...
like that band this kind of sounds like Pavement, Neu!, and Wire all
thrown into a blender, sprinkled with a heavy dose of modern
indie/punk sarcasm (see "New York's Alright if You Like Sex & Phones")
and wrapped up in an aesthetic that almost blatantly bites the Fall
circa Hex Enduction Hour and Room to Live. It remains to be seen if
this has the staying power of Parquet Courts' Light Up Gold, but right
now I'm enjoying this upbeat, melodic indie rock.

Good Throb: Live in WFMU cassette (Muscle Horse)
Live-on-the-radio set from the almighty Good Throb! When I listen to
this tape I think pretty much the same thing I thought when I was
watching them play live earlier this year, i.e. "I really wish they
just played every single song they've ever written." Still, though,
this is a pretty solid set with early favorites like "Bag," a couple
of the best LP songs like "Double White Denim" and "Acid House," and a
cover of "Tube Disasters" by Flux of Pink Indians that they played
live at several dates. Not as essential as their vinyl, obviously, but
I can't get enough of this band and the set is well-recorded and
powerful.

Alright folks, the big news is that the new Whatever Brains double 12" is =
out now!<br><br>
<center><img border=3D0 width=3D"480" height=3D"480" src=3D"http://cdn.sho=
pify.com/s/files/1/0255/7539/products/2014-09-21_17.38.23_large.jpg?v=3D14=
11336673"></center><br><br>
Here's the official description:
<p>Whatever Brains have always been a band inclined toward the grand =
statement, but their latest release reaches new levels of epic. Not a =
conventional LP or a double LP, SSR-63/SSR-64 is actually two separate EPs =
packaged as one. SSR-63 is a single 22-minute track spread across both =
sides of a 45RPM 12". A series of linked compositions a la Venom&rsquo;s =
<i>At War with Satan</i> or the Subhumans&rsquo; <i>From the Cradle to the =
Grave</i>, SSR-63&rsquo;s lyrics chronicle the plight of a Russian family =
who lived in complete isolation in remote Siberia for more than 40 years. =
The music is similarly wide in scope, drifting organically from maximalist =
punk to minimalist, country-tinged lament to pumping electronica in an =
astoundingly natural fashion. As for the other 12&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s a new =
4-song EP called SSR-64, which continues to develop the wide sonic palette =
that the best tracks on their previous LP hinted at. SSR-64 also delivers =
&ldquo;UVOD,&rdquo; the closest thing to a pop hit Whatever Brains have =
ever created. As ever, a good portion of the people reading this will be =
confused and repulsed by the Whatever Brains, while the remainder will =
insist vocally that this is one of the most truly innovative and exciting =
records of 2014.</p>
<p>I should also mention the physical characteristics of this release, =
because it&rsquo;s one that you&rsquo;re definitely going to want to own =
on vinyl. First of all, we put a lot of effort (and money) into mastering =
for this release, and the result is easily the best-sounding =
(fidelity-wise, at least) record that Sorry State has ever produced. Since =
we splurged on the sonics, we&rsquo;ve done our best to keep the price of =
this thing low with screen printed jackets made from recycled materials. =
In a world of tossed-off, insta-file releases, holding SSR-63/SSR-64 in =
your hands will make you realize why you still care about vinyl.</p>

These are limited to 300 copies and are already going very fast.<br><br>
I really can't say enough how excited I am for this to finally be out... =
Whatever Brains continue to be so ahead of the game, making some of the =
most unique, intense, and infectious music around. I've said it before, =
but following this band closely feels like following Husker Du or the =
Kinks or the Fall at their peak... each new release is a total surprise =
that somehow manages to completely up the ante. If you haven't paid =
attention before, I highly encourage you to get on board now. And if you =
need to get caught up, we've put their previous records (as well as a few =
others from related bands) on sale. Check out the sale here: <a =

That isn't the only release we have for you right now, though: me and =
Seth's band No Love also has a new tape. Here's the info on that:<br><br>
<center><img border=3D0 width=3D"480" height=3D"480" src=3D"http://cdn.sho=
pify.com/s/files/1/0255/7539/products/IMG_1309_large.jpg?v=3D1411085162"><=
/center><br><br>
After an earlier self-released demo, Raleigh, North Carolina&rsquo;s No =
Love move to Sorry State proper for their second release. Dispensing with =
some of the poppier tendencies of their demo, No Love play fist-pumping =
melodic punk along the lines of the Buzzcocks, the Avengers, and the =
Canadian Subhumans, occasionally augmented with the sarcastic snap of =
bands like the Angry Samoans. Tape #2 contains four new tracks recorded by =
Colin Swanson-White (Davidians), and the new recording does a much better =
job of capturing the band&rsquo;s dense combination of melodic bass lines, =
dueling lead guitar and anthemic vocals. Cassettes are professionally =
duplicated and come with a digital download. Limited to 100 =
copies.<br><br>
Check it out on BandCamp here: <a href=3D"http://t.ymlp222.net/uyeaaauhhju=
afaushafaeuem/click.php">https://sorrystaterecords.bandcamp.com/album/tape=
-2</a><br><br>
These are also flying out the door, so don't sleep! We're really proud of =
this new No Love stuff. We also recorded two other songs during the same =
session and those will be our debut single as part of the Sorry State NC =
Singles Series... that should be out in November probably.<br><br>
One more thing for this update. While we've always been hesitant to sell =
much used stuff online, with the store's first anniversary right around =
the corner (hard to believe!), we decided it's high time to start selling =
more online... plus our bins are completely full and we need to move some =
stock. We've been steadily adding stuff to <a =
href=3D"http://t.ymlp222.net/uymagauhhjuaiaushapaeuem/click.php">the used =
section of the site</a> (which you should check regularly since most of =
the time these don't show up in the regular new products feed), and we're =
also having a big sale to clear out some space in our overflowing 7" bins. =
Here's the info on that:<br><br>
In an effort to clear some space, we&rsquo;re unloading tons of used =
7&rdquo;s that have been sitting here for a while. Since we want to get =
rid of as many as possible, if you order 5 or more we&rsquo;ll give you =
10% off, or if you order 10 or more you&rsquo;ll get 20% off.<br><br>
Feel free to combine orders from this list with an order from the Sorry =
State Records web site.<br><br>
International customers: we can ship about 15 7&rdquo;s in a flat-rate =
priority mailer. We can send 15 7&rdquo;s to Canada for $20 or 15 =
7&rdquo;s anywhere else in the world for $24.<br><br>
Please email your order to daniel@sorrystaterecords.com. We&rsquo;ll pull =
everything and get back to you with a total for everything that&rsquo;s =
still available.<br><br>

Wipers: <i>Nome Noma</i> 7" (Meanbean)<br>
Not to be confused with the much more famous Portland band of the same =
name, Meanbean Records' debut release is a reissue of the 1980 single by =
this obscure Toronto punk band. I hadn't heard of this before the reissue, =
which is surprising because this is a top-notch early punk record from a =
city with a well-known scene. Maybe it was that this record was a bit =
behind the times... by 1980 the original '77 punk scene that this single =
owes its clearest sonic debt to was dying out and making way for hardcore, =
of which you'll find none here. However, if your idea of punk is bands =
like Teenage Head, the Pointed Sticks, Lost Kids, Buzzcocks, etc., these =
two tracks will hit your sweet spot. Definitely recommended for all of you =
'77 punk / KBD heads out there.<br><br>

Nightfell: <i>The Ever Living Mourn</i> 12" (Southern Lord)<br>
Debut LP from this new Portland project featuring Todd from Tragedy / His =
Hero Is Gone and Tim from Aldebaran/Mournful Congregation. If I had to =
choose one adjective to describe this record it would certainly be BLEAK. =
While I'm sure Tragedy fans can get down with this... after all, Todd's =
songwriting style is definitely apparent and there's something of =
Tragedy's epic sweep in nearly every track here, but it's sort of like =
they took away all of the catchier, more anthemic aspects of Tragedy and =
left all of the bleak dirginess. It's definitely more metal, leaning =
toward a kind of blackened doom sound, but there's a lot of Hellhammer's =
primitive, almost punk take on metal as well. Apparently this project came =
out of the members dealing with a bunch of tragedy and loss, and that =
definitely comes across in the music... it's the kind of record you listen =
to alone, in the dark, when you're pondering how much life sucks.<br><br>

Brotherhood: <i>Till Death</i> 12" (Southern Lord)<br>
So this was a bit of a surprise... I know that Southern Lord has been =
re-releasing a bunch of 80s hardcore over the past few years, but I didn't =
expect them to start mining the well of late 80s straight edge / youth =
crew obscurities. However, Southern Lord owner / Sunn O))) guitarist Greg =
Anderson was the guitarist in Brotherhood, so I guess it makes sense =
(though he isn't even the most famous Brotherhood alumnus... bassist Nate =
Mendel went on to play in Foo Fighters(!)). Anyway, I remember owning the =
old Crucial Response version of this LP back in the day and sold it in a =
purge of nearly all of my old youth crew records, but revisiting this =
years down the line it's actually way more ripping than I remember. It's =
definitely of its time and isn't really breaking the mold in any way, but =
it's a concise, well-recorded, and powerful document of the sound and =
style. At their best Brotherhood could approach the stop/start intensity =
of Straight Ahead (as they do on the classic first track, "The Deal"), and =
they also have a bit common with the post-Youth of Today generation of =
NYHC / CBGB bands... bands like Breakdown, Outburst, Sick of It All, etc. =
At its core, though, this is pure youth crew straight edge, clearly =
inspired by Youth of Today, Side by Side, Wide Awake, etc., and it's as =
strong a take on that sound as you're going to find. I should also mention =
that the packaging on this is extensive and awesome. The jacket is on a =
very heavy stock, it comes with an obi strip, and (most importantly) a =
very thick, full-color, 7"-size booklet that not only reproduces the =
layout of the band's lone 7" EP, but also adds dozens of great photographs =
that look like they were ripped straight from the pages of <i>Schism</i> =
or <i>Hardware</i>. I'm not sure that, at the end of the day, this is =
great music or anything, but if like me you only need to own a handful of =
youth crew records this should be a strong contender for being one of =
them.<br><br>

Various: <i>Maggot Minded</i> cassette (Maggot Mind)<br>
New pressing (I assume?) of this 2008 compilation featuring a number of =
bands from Olympia, Seattle, and surrounding areas, including HIV, Loose =
Change, Horrible, White Boss, Funerot, Sisters, and Sex/Vid. Like a good =
regional tape comp should be, everything is raw, straightforward, and to =
the point. Some of these bands went on to bigger things and some didn't =
(obviously Sex/Vid is the standout band here and indeed their tracks are =
the strongest), but I would hardly describe the quality is uneven, and =
everything kind of has that weird, slightly artsy vibe that Washington =
(particularly Olympia) bands always seem to have. Maybe a curiosity, but =
releases like this are really what hardcore and punk are all =
about.<br><br>

Pusrad: <i>Errare Est Humanum</i> 12" (Dead Beat)<br>
2nd 12" from this great Swedish band. I know that a lot of people don't =
like Pusrad, and I guess that's understandable because their sound is a =
little goofy. If you haven't heard them, the "gimmick" (if you could call =
it that) is that the songs are VERY short (averaging about 20 seconds) and =
are built around all of these super tight little changes and stops and =
starts. It isn't particularly heavy, though, and even though it's very =
fast it doesn't really sound like hardcore. It's really sort of like an =
updated version of early Wire if they only did songs like "Field Day for =
the Sundays" and "Surgeon's Girl." On the surface it sounds like an =
incredibly limiting framework, but every time a new Pusrad record comes =
out it astounds me how much they can do within it. Listening to this is =
kind of exhausting because it goes by fast, but there are so many great =
hooks that you can't help but play the record over and over... I'm on my =
fourth or fifth consecutive listen as I type this. I feel like every new =
Pusrad record has been better than the last, and this continues that =
trend. Recommended.<br><br>

Total Control: <i>Typical System</i> 12" (Iron Lung)<br>
Man, this was one follow-up I was really nervous about hearing. Even =
though I'd heard their early singles, Total Control's first LP still =
seemed to come totally out of nowhere... the whole post-punk revival was =
just starting to get off the ground and it seemed instantly to raise the =
bar several notches. But then the single on Sub Pop was good, but not =
really explosive, and in my opinion the songs on the split 12" with the Oh =
Sees didn't really stick out that much either. However, it's clear now =
that Total Control were saving themselves for this record, because it's =
really incredible. The environment in 2014 is very different... everyone =
and their brother seems to have a post-punk band, yet Total Control still =
feel miles ahead. The intro track is a total scorcher, a blistering blast =
of Depeche Mode-influenced electro pop that I think is easily the best =
track they've done (particularly in this style) since "Paranoid Video." =
Over the course of the LP the band moves so fluidly between so many =
styles... krautrock, new wave, garage-punk, and the big closer "Safety =
Net," which could almost be like U2 or something with its big, triumphant =
melody. I've probably listened to this 30+ times since it came out, and I =
don't see it getting old any time soon. A serious contender for best LP of =

Ty Segall: <i>Manipulator</i> 2x12" (Drag City)<br>
Sorry State has been carrying Ty Segall's records since back when we =
couldn't give them away, and like a lot of people I always liked him a lot =
but thought he was capable of just a little bit more. Well, =
<i>Manipulator</i> is that more... reading the press leading up to this =
album Segall talked a lot about how he took his time with this one and it =
really shows. He used to bury his melodies in so much fuzz that it took a =
lot of effort on the listener's part to pick them out (not to mention the =
lofty task of wading through his huge discography), but on this record =
everything is right up front, waiting to be loved. Admittedly it's not as =
furious as some of his other stuff, but this sort of rootsy glam sound =
(I'd compare it to records like Bowie's <i>The Man Who Sold the World</i> =
or Lou Reed's <i>Transformer</i>) is such a great framework for Segall and =
every song is a legit hit. This is a big record and will likely be all =
over NPR, Pitchfork, etc. in the months to come (and on those respective =
publications' year-end best-of lists too, I'm sure), but it's legit enough =
for those of us in the underground as well. Until he makes a better =
record, but position is that this is the Ty Segall you want in your =
collection.<br><br>

General Speech Omnibus Vol 2 zine<br>
Latest "omnibus issue" that collects the best content from this =
long-running fanzine. The content is really top-notch... the bands and =
labels interviewed and profiled (including DiE, Criaturas, Discrete =
Records, Terveet K&auml;det, Fracaso, and a big feature on current Mexican =
punk) are almost all really interesting, and the interview questions and =
general level of thought is much higher than your typical punk fanzine. If =
you're a zine-lover this is pretty much a must-read.<br><br>

Aborticido: S/T 7" (General Speech)<br>
5-song 7" from this raw hardcore band out of Mexico. Actually, there's one =
song title in Japanese and one in English in addition to two in Spanish =
(and one in apparent nonsense?), so as you might expect these guys seem to =
have a good handle on the worldwide hardcore scene... this isn't some =
backwoods grindcore band or anything. Interestingly, Aborticido seem to be =
inspired primarily by 80s Japanese punk... they remind me of the noisier, =
harsher bands on the ADK label, and the singer's kind of whiny, =
high-pitched scream actually sounds a LOT like the vocalist of Aburadako, =
whose flexi is one of my favorite Japanese records. Some of this record is =
total blur-core, but they rock things out on the last track, "Esta =
Culero," and it's really almost a dead ringer for the Aburadako flexi... =
if you want a less obscure reference it also sounds a bit like the Stalin. =
Any way you cut it, though, this is a cool little EP with some rad =
artwork. Limited to 250 copies.<br><br>

Koward: <i>Desperate</i> 7" (Side Two)<br>
Brand new 7" from this Boston band, and it's a ripper. I guess the sound =
they're going for is the kind of straightforward, barreling, Doom-inspired =
kind of thing, and they definitely have that going on (and in that respect =
they actually sound a bit like Sorry State faves No Tomorrow), but I think =
it's the other aspects of their sound that really elevate Koward. The =
vocals are very hardcore... it sounds more like the type of singing on =
like a Boston Strangler record or something, and I can't overstate how =
great it is to hear a crusty-sounding record without boring vocals. They =
also have a couple of little musical tricks up their sleeve... a blazing =
guitar solo here, a "Protest & Survive"-esque palm-muted part there... =
it's definitely enough variation to keep this 7" snapping along.<br><br>

Low Threat Profile: <i>Product #3</i> 7" (Six Weeks)<br>
Latest EP from this band composed of power violence legends. =
Interestingly, there isn't as much of that whiplash-inducing power =
violence sound on this as you might expect... yes, it's very tight, but in =
general the intricacy of the changes is de-emphasized here in favor of a =
much more powerful, straightforward hardcore sound. Aside from the obvious =
power violence parts, this just sounds like angry old dude hardcore like =
Inmates or Out Cold or something like that. Who knows if anyone outside =
the PV scene will give this a listen, but it's a bruiser.<br><br>

The Ukiah Drag: <i>In the Reaper's Quarters</i> 12" (Wharf Cat)<br>
I'm really surprised no enterprising British music journalist has named =
this little emerging scene of American indie/punk bands that seems to =
coalescing at the moment. While there isn't really a cohesive sound, there =
does seem to be something rather coherent in the aesthetic of bands like =
Merchandise, Destruction Unit, Milk Music, the Men, and Ukiah Drag (which, =
I guess, would make the definitive document of this scene the recent 3-way =
split LP on 540 Records). Even if they sound quite different, these bands =
share similar stories, with members coming up through the DIY hardcore =
scene and growing to make music that's a little bit more ambitious and =
refined. I guess that you might distill it down to kids discovering their =
dad's Neil Young records (something that's been going on at least since =
Dinosaur Jr), but still there seems to be something unique about these =
bands, and at moments they can make it feel like a genuinely exciting =
scene is happening. Well, with this debut LP Ukiah Drag seem determined to =
take their place at this table, bringing a sound that's equal parts the =
Neil Young-isms of the later Men stuff, Merchandise's druggy haze, and =
Destruction Unit's psychedelic forward lurch. However, the Ukiah Drag's =
signature move seems to be the Gun Club-esque punk/blues vamp, something =
that takes up a big part of the a-side of this LP and definitely serves as =
a sort of sonic trademark. However, by the end of the record you don't =
know what you're listening to anymore as it devolves into the ambient hum =
of "Night of Immaculacy." This is an ambitious, captivating LP, and I'm =
sure it'll be too "mature" or artsy for some, but if you dig the =
aforementioned bands this definitely fits into your scene for a =
reason.<br><br>

The Gotobeds: <i>Poor People Are Revolting</i> 12" (12XU)<br>
Debut 12" from this Pittsburgh band featuring former members of Kim Phuc. =
Kim Phuc was a big, noisy, and nasty band, but Gotobeds are something =
completely different. I figure they must be named after the drummer from =
Wire, and indeed Wire seems like an obvious influence here. The music is =
upbeat, bouncy, melodic, and built around a guitar sound that's muscular =
but at the same time razor-thin and biting. Really, though, what the =
Gotobeds remind me of are Parquet Courts... like that band this kind of =
sounds like Pavement, Neu!, and Wire all thrown into a blender, sprinkled =
with a heavy dose of modern indie/punk sarcasm (see "New York's Alright if =
You Like Sex & Phones") and wrapped up in an aesthetic that almost =
blatantly bites the Fall circa <i>Hex Enduction Hour</i> and <i>Room to =
Live</i>. It remains to be seen if this has the staying power of Parquet =
Courts' <i>Light Up Gold</i>, but right now I'm enjoying this upbeat, =
melodic indie rock.<br><br>

Good Throb: <i>Live in WFMU</i> cassette (Muscle Horse)<br>
Live-on-the-radio set from the almighty Good Throb! When I listen to this =
tape I think pretty much the same thing I thought when I was watching them =
play live earlier this year, i.e. "I really wish they just played every =
single song they've ever written." Still, though, this is a pretty solid =
set with early favorites like "Bag," a couple of the best LP songs like =
"Double White Denim" and "Acid House," and a cover of "Tube Disasters" by =
Flux of Pink Indians that they played live at several dates. Not as =
essential as their vinyl, obviously, but I can't get enough of this band =
and the set is well-recorded and powerful.<br><br>
