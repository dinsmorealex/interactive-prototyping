Available: Aug 01, 2014

Multiple spaces are open at Kingsland Design &amp; Engineering Lab. Kings=

 and fabricators that need a space to develop and prototype their product=
s. Our shop is split into a shared Design area and a Fabrication area. Th=
e Design area offers your own built-in desk, WiFi, access to office and l=
arge format printers, Dimension 1200sst FDM 3D printer and electronics eq=
uipment. The Fabrication section offers access to table saws, chop/pull s=
aws, sand blasting, MIG/TIG/Oxy welding and welding tables, laser engrave=
r/cutter (acrylics), 3 Vertical Milling Centers (Johnford 500VMC, Milltro=
nics, and RoboDrill), Manual/CNC Bridgeport Hybrid and Manual Lathe. Holy=
 Shit, right? Build whatever the hell you want, but we're mostly tailored=
 towards metals and plastics rather than wood to keep dust down. Also, we=
 stress &quot;prototyping&quot;. We have not the room for production-leve=
l fabrication of large items. But, you can sure get to that point here. T=
his is a great spot for those that divide time between computer-based des=
ign and physical prototyping or want to get into computer-aided manufactu=
ring. Kinetic Sculpture, Robotics, Bicycle Frames, Product Design all see=
m to work well in this environment.

Renters get a spot in the built-in desk area in our shared office space t=
hat includes a storage shelf and room on our material racks. Build it out=
 to suit your needs. In order to keep things affordable we are now allowi=
ng two-people per desk area. If you find you need an entire area to yours=
elf, we can give you an entire space at a discount. Of course, renting a =
space gives you access to the entire shop and equipment.

Sunny, windowed space available in one of the most well known artist buil=

h a waiting list.  We spent months whitewashing and setting up the studio=
 with plenty of lights, electrical outlets, and a $4,000 ventilated spray=
/casting/dust booth in the center. You will not find a similar space in t=
he neighborhood.

Available studio:
The entire 2,500-square-foot room is divided into four studios. The space=
 for rent is the front, left-hand corner in the panoramic photo, and is s=
hown fully in the photo captioned &quot;available space.&quot;  It is app=
roximately 360 square feet and costs $800/month.  There are partial divid=
ers to maintain an open feel and allow abundant natural light to pass.  T=
here is an 8'x12' drywall partition separating your space from the next. =

Other details:
--Spray/dust booth use optional at an extra expense, to be discussed upon=
 meeting.

The building and neighborhood:
Our building and its occupants have been written up in many art publicati=
ons; you can see a sample by Googling our address.  We have a vibrant com=
munity full of creatives ranging from furniture designers and fabricators=
, to artists who exhibit in Chelsea and internationally. The neighborhood=
 is exploding with new stores, bars, restaurants, and more.

Us:
It is a quiet studio; everyone has different schedules and it is rare tha=
t two or more people are in the entire space at once.  We are a friendly =
and relaxed group who have known each other for years, looking for a seri=
ous and considerate artist to join us.  We are a mix of sculptors and pai=
nters, working in mixed media, but nothing that is noxious or which invad=
es others' spaces. We help each other if and when needed, yet also highly=
 respect each other's privacy to focus on his/her work.

What is absolutely not tolerated:
--Maltreatment of the space (damage, not participating in helping maintai=
n the common area, sink or trash)
--Any activity that disrupts others' ability to work in the space (excess=
ive noise, dust, fumes, etc.)
--Late rent
--Smoking in the studio
--Parties or social gatherings in the space (unless organized together or=
 run by everyone)

$500.00 Per Month, East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 775 sq. ft., 2 Large Desk=
s in Quiet &amp; Sunny Studio
Available: Aug 01, 2014 through Jul 31, 2015

We are a small architectural design firm with 2 people working out of thi=
s studio in Bushwick/East Williamsburg. The location is pretty great in-b=
etween the L (Montrose, Morgan, Grand) and M (Flushing) stops. The area i=
s a safe and gritty manufacturing district with lots of mural wall art. T=
here are a number of very good coffee shops around as well. (Fitzcarraldo=
, Falansai, Anchored Inn, New Town, 3rd Ward)

Our building is an old 2 story brick building which is extremely well mai=
ntained. It has a freight elevator and a very clean bathroom. The studio =
is on the 1st floor and has hardwood floors and 5 large windows facing Ea=
st. The ceilings are 10' high and overall the studio has an area of about=
 775 sqft. Me and my partner moved in here in February and set it up with=
 all new (Ikea) furniture. We have 4 over-sized large oak desks and we ar=
e currently using 2. Each desk measures 80&quot;; by 36&quot;, so they ca=
n comfortably fit 2 people each. Each studio mate will also get a shelf f=
or their stuff. We have wifi and a large TV (which we almost never use). =
There is a pin up wall and a projector in the seating area. There is a al=
so a sink, a water kettle, a microwave and a French press. In the back of=
 the studio we have a work area with a work desk measuring 72&quot; by 80=
&quot;. We use it to build architectural models.

We hope to expand at some point in the future, which is why we got a larg=
er space, but currently we would like to share our space. Me and my partn=
er are in the studio pretty much all day and all weekend. We are working =
quietly and most of the time we listen to NPR.

The rent for a large desk is $500 for 1 person. If you would like to shar=
e with someone (they are big), it is $700. If you are interested in joini=
ng us on a monthly basis and visit the studio, please email us with a lit=
tle bit about yourself.

The Building:
http://www.15dunhamplace.com/
 I have lived in the apartment for 1.5 years and was the very first tenet=
 in this unit. I adore Dunham Place.=20

- Gym
- Community room with TV, leather couches, and foos ball table.

diately responsive to all requests.=20

The Neighborhood:
- A giant Urban Market grocery store opened this year on the ground floor=
 of the building. They have a cheese monger and sell beer (amongst other =
things).=20
- Donna is our corner bar.=20
- Marlow and Sons and Diner restaurants are three blocks down the road. C=
elebrated local restaurants and home of a dang good chocolate croissant/a=
fternoon cocktail.
- Marlow and Daughters grocer is a stones throw away as well - one of Bro=
oklyn's most touted local meat deli/cheese shop/artisan goods store. I ge=
t a half loaf of fresh bread from here every week, and I'm never going ba=
ck to regular store bread.
- The feel is generally creative, building tenets are an eclectic mix, Le=

 like being in Williamsburg without being in the midst of weekend walking=
 tours. =20
- Transportation -- Situated along the waterfront, Dunham Place is conven=
iently located just one subway stop from Manhattan on either the JMZ or L=
 subway lines. Convenient bus and ferry stops 1-3 blocks away. The subway=

$1,150.00 Per Month, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, Lovely Spacious Sunny Room in =
shared Apt Overlooking McGolrick Park
Available: Aug 15, 2014

We have a large sunny room opening up in our lovely three bedroom apartme=
nt for $1175/month. It is on the third floor of a charming 3-story walk u=
p. Apartment was recently renovated with all new appliances and hardwood =
floors and the living room has beautiful views of McGolrick Park. The bed=
room available is around 10X15 with a window overlooking the well-groomed=
 backyard (and the Freedom Tower &amp; Empire State Building in the dista=
nt background).

To move in you would need first month's rent and one month deposit ($2,35=
0). Rent is due strictly on the 1st of every month. Landlords/owners live=
 three doors down. Utilities (gas &amp; electric) are split three ways an=
d come to about $35 each month (around $60/each in the very hot summer mo=
nths) and internet is an additional $15/each a month. We do not have cabl=
e but we have all these crazy adapters to hook up phone and laptop to the=
 TV for proper Netflix viewing.=20

We are two females (31 and 32) who work in education and Music PR. We hav=
e a very chill vibe in the apartment and like for it to be a relaxing pla=
ce to collectively hang out, cook dinners, watch TV, listen to records, d=
rink wine, what have you. We like to go out on the town and sometimes hav=
e friends over but very rarely have loud/crazy get togethers at home. We'=
re both neat, always do our dishes, and take turns cleaning the apartment=
 and buying supplies. We're hoping to find someone around our age who can=
 commit to at least 6 months (preferably longer). The new tenant will hav=
e to be approved by our landlords and prove full time employment with pay=
 stubs. There is no smoking in the apartment. The landlords (and the room=
mates) prefer no pets but may possibly make an exception for a super awes=
ome, and very well behaved, small dog that does not bark when left alone.=


If interested please email. Let us know if you have any questions! We're =
hoping to interview people on Saturday and secure our new roommie in the =
next week.=20

$1,137.50 Per Month, Bushwick, Brooklyn, Big, sunny room available in Bus=
hwick 2 blocks from Maria Hernandez Park
Available: Sept 01, 2014

I have a bedroom opening up in my 2-bedroom apartment in Bushwick, availa=
ble September 1.

About the apartment: It's located three blocks off of the Jefferson stop =
on the L line (close to Hana Natural Foods, Northern Kingdom, coffee shop=
s, juice bars, etc.). A newly renovated Associated Supermarket is two blo=
cks away, as is Maria Hernandez Park and two separate laundromats. The co=
mmon space is long and the bedrooms are located on opposite ends of the a=
partment, so there's plenty of privacy. There are two bathrooms (you'll h=
ave your own right in your room) which is really nice.

About the room: I've lived in the room for the past two years and really,=
 really love it. It's big enough to fit a queen sized bed and a dresser e=
asily, as well as a small desk. It has a good sized closet and, like I me=
ntioned above, it's own bathroom. The room also has two 6-foot windows th=
at get great morning light, and a fire escape that's great for sitting on=
 when the weather is nice.=20

About me: I'm a 25 year old copywriter currently working at an ad agency =
in Manhattan. I travel a bit for work and pleasure, so you'll likely have=
 the apartment to yourself for days at a time. I'm a vegan and if you are=
 too, that's a plus! That being said, I've lived with omnivores for years=
 and am not judgmental or weird about sharing pots (I promise). I'm prett=
y neat; I don't mind if a dish or two spends the night in the sink, but I=
 do vacuum and mop weekly and try to keep the common space clear of any p=
ersonal clutter. When I'm home, I'm pretty mellow. I have people over fro=
m time to time, but I'm most likely to be found in my room reading or wat=
ching a movie. I also have two cats named Lemon and Miso who are super af=
fectionate and fun, so unfortunately I can't take on any more pets.

About you: You like (and are not allergic to) cats and are down with payi=
ng rent on time. Those are about my only hard requirements. I'm open to c=
ouples, guys, girls, whatever.=20

Look forward to hearing from you!

Available: Aug 01, 2014

 Hi,
I have an unfurnished bedroom and spacious living room available in a lar=
ge 2 bedroom apartment.The bedroom can fit a full bed, dresser and has a =
closet and window. You would also have the large living room to yourself,=
 which is unfurnished. The apartment is very long and rooms are very sepa=
rate from each other, so there is a lot of privacy. And of course there i=
s a shared kitchen and bathroom.

Its on a beautiful, quiet, tree lined street one and a half blocks from N=
ostrand Ave. where there are several coffee shops, a pub, a yoga studio a=
nd markets. Its about a 15 min walk to Franklin Ave. with lots of restaur=
ants, bars, cafes, and organic markets. The 3 and A/C trains at Nostrand =
are both a 10 minute walk away.

I am looking for a fairly quiet, and considerate female roommate 25+. I a=
m the same and am a graphic designer in my 30s. I generally go out more t=
han have people over and am looking for a roommate who feels similarly bu=
t guests are welcome. If this sounds like a good fit please get in touch!=

$1,100.00 Per Month, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Private, Decent Room in Uniq=
ue Space
Available: Aug 04, 2014

Apartment:
Available August 1stish, flexible move-in date
Close to M/J and L trains
Urban market 2 blocks away.
Bodega on the corner
Utilities included
Washer/dryer in apt
Plenty of storage
No neighbors, no one above or below
Porch
Next to hip bars and restaurants

Room:
Walk in closet, 2 rows of hanging and shelves all around
Hallway leading to room for storage and shelves
Currently has 2 people living in the space

Neat space for rent, one a kind. Our building is more like a house than a=
n apartment in South Williamsburg. We are on the top (second) floor with =
a large  porch balcony, a huge living/dining room with washer/dryer, 1.5 =
bathrooms, and 3 bedrooms. The room for rent is in the back of the house =
and is currently furnished with a queen size bed, side table, and desk wi=
th chair to give you an idea of its size and usability. A couple was livi=
ng there but we would prefer no couples, sorry! There is a medium size wa=
lk in closet to hang clothes or put a dresser.

There are 2 other housemates, both male early 30s; one is in web design, =
the other the cycling industry.

There are no animals in the house (and haven't been for years) but an imp=
ressively well-behaved dog would be fine. No cats, sorry.

The neighborhood is South Williamsburg. We're close to a new supermarket,=
 with a new fancy bodega on the corner, many popular bars and venues all =
around, but still some inexpensive places to eat and do your normal life =
stuff.

Ideally you're someone who's doing something exciting in NYC and lives a =
healthy balance of doing your own thing and being sociable with the other=
 housemates. The house has a lot more freedom than most other living situ=
ations in NYC; it is conducive to many different types of projects but ca=
n be a little rough around the edges. It's decent enough if your parents =
come to visit though.

All utilities are included. Flexible move in; one month security deposit =
($1100) plus pro-rated first month.

$885.00 Per Month, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, Seeking a fourth housema=
te for our home in Bed Stuy for September 1st.
Available: Sept 01, 2014

We live in a quiet corner of Bed-Stuy, on a block of kind neighbors and m=
ulti-generational families. The A/C and J/Z trains are about 12-min walk =
away, with bus-lines and bike paths even closer.

Our apartment takes up the top two floors of a brownstone that, in additi=
on to 4 bedrooms, features an open kitchen and dining room; a living room=
 so big we've carved out areas for work/study, entertaining, and TV-viewi=
ng; two bathrooms; and, a meditation/yoga room. There is also a washer/dr=
yer in the downstairs bedroom that is for everyone to use.

The available bedroom is about 12 x 15 ft and accommodates many configura=
tions of furniture - currently a queen-sized bed, desk, and two bookcases=
 all fit comfortably. It's next to our yoga/meditation room, and shares a=
 door with that space. The room has two closets for clothing and storage,=
 and beautiful features including an ornate fireplace, parquet floors. Tw=
o huge windows face the backyard and keep it sunny in all seasons.=20

Rent for the room is $885/month. As a house we share the cost of utilitie=
s, internet, house supplies (toilet paper, paper towels, etc), and some f=
ood.=20

Were seeking someone who is an open communicator, independent, mature, re=
sponsible, etc. -- and, importantly, someone who wants to help build a ho=
me. We're all dedicated to healthy lifestyles and lead busy lives that of=
ten take us out of the house, but we look forward to seeing each other an=
d checking in. Our new housemate should be willing to sign a lease, which=
 were renewing. For our landlord, you will need to provide proof of emplo=
yment and a housing reference. We're also looking for someone who has liv=
ed independently long enough to have material stability ... someone who b=
rings some furniture, maybe a TV, household goods and kitchen gadgets, as=
 the housemate who's moving out is one of two who have provided our home =
with its amenities. Please note that were not looking for more pets.=20

We're all women in our 30s. More about us ...

Rhoda is a West Coast girl through and through, as evidenced by her love =
of avocados. She edits YA and children's fiction, and half the week she w=
orks from home. Her current obsessions include Dr. Who, coconut ice cream=
, and nail art (subject to change with the season). She rides her rickety=
 old bicycle nearly everywhere and has been sighted on several occasions =
throughout Brooklyn attempting a track stand.

Therese is a woman of color, originally from Indiana but claims herself a=
s a New Yorker since she has lived in the city for more than a decade. Sh=
e works full-time as a trauma therapist. She enjoys exploring undiscovere=
d parts of the city, spending time at the beach as much as possible in th=
e summer, and philosophizing about everything and nothing with friends an=
d roommates over a shared meal or a glass of wine.

Deborah is the newest to Brooklyn/NY, as she recently moved from Seattle =
(and lived in Chicago before that). This home was her first on the East C=
oast in 14 years. She currently works from home for a cultural studies jo=
urnal and a global health and development foundation while also working t=
o complete a PhD. Most evenings she's over at her girlfriends, seeing fri=
ends, taking a spin class, or going to meditation in the city. She has an=
 affable and only sometimes ornery 16-year-old cat. =20

$700.00 Per Month, Ridgewood, Queens, One or two bedrooms in a beautiful =
apartment with two skylights!
Available: Sept 01, 2014

Hi there,=20

We posted the wrong date last week - move in date would be September 1 or=
 September 15, depending on what's better for you!=20

We are a couple looking to share a unique, beautiful apartment in Ridgewo=
od, Queens. The apartment has three bedrooms (all have windows), a large =
kitchen, a very large living room, ample closet space, and sits on the se=
cond floor of a two-story brick house on a tree-lined, one-block street. =
It has hardwood floors throughout (except in the kitchen). The street loo=
ks out onto a cemetery and a park. It's a ten minute walk to either the L=
 train (Dekalb) or the M train (Forest Ave.), buses also work well from h=
ere. The rent is $700 a month for one bedroom, or two bedrooms for $1000 =
(though we can only rent to one person).

We are a musician and a painter, and both translate from German to Englis=
h to pay the bills. We read and cook a lot, have dinner parties, and have=
 guests pass through on occasion (which you are welcome to have as well!)=
. We both value our home and spend a lot of time and energy on the decora=
tion, the feel, and general care of it. We would hope that you do too!=20=


It is important to the landlord that we have paperwork, so a verifiable s=
ource of income is necessary. If you have questions about what that means=
 specifically, by all means write and we can explain. We are looking for =
someone who can commit to a year, and someone who is excited about being =
actively involved in the space.

Thanks!

$1,350.00 Per Month, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, Sunny Sublet in Greenpoint for=
 the Summer (bedroom + private living space)
Available: Sept 01, 2014 through Sept 30, 2014

Looking for someone to take my amazing two room space in a railroad apart=
ment in Greenpoint near the Nassau ave stop.  Great space with lots of li=
ght, it has full sun all day and looks out onto the many back gardens of =
my housing block.  The bed is in its only room that stays cool and has do=
ors that can be shut during the day to make the living room area more coz=
y. The only space shared with my roommate is the kitchen and bathroom.=20=


Amazing locations, a couple blocks away from Mccaren Park, which has fiel=
ds, track, and public swimming pool, and in walking distance to all the g=
reat restaurants and bars of Greenpoint.  It's on the border of Williamsb=
urg and walking distance to the L train.=20

My roommate is a super friendly gay guy in his early 30s who works at a r=
ecord store and DJs. We both keep to ourselves, the apartment feels almos=
t like a studio, but love socializing via the kitchen. We're both really =
chill so prefer someone who doesn't bring the party home.  The bathroom i=
s in the hallway, only a foot outside the kitchen door. The whole floor j=
ust feels like our apartment as  the building is really small with only o=
ne apartment on the floor above of us, also young people, who are super n=
ice, but I've rarely seen them.

I work as an artist and filmmaker and will be leaving to Europe for a cou=
ple months, so looking for someone trust worthy and respectful of the spa=
ce and my things. I don't have many belongings so will be able to clear m=
ost of the room and closet space.=20

Rent will be 1350 for including utilities.

$1,500.00 Per Month, South East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 750 sq. ft., One =
Bedroom in a Great Loft Style Apartment in Williamsburg
Available: Sept 01, 2014 through Oct 31, 2014

Your bedroom in this great two bedroom loft is right off the Lorimer M tr=
ain, across from the largest supermarket in North Brooklyn, Food Bazar, a=
nd a couple blocks away from Graham Ave restaurants, cafes, and stores.
The apartment is about 750 sq ft (ballparking it here-- see pics for deta=
ils) on the ground floor facing a quiet side street.=20
One of the bedrooms faces the street, and is not the one available, altho=
ugh I will come back at end of september so chances are that all apartmen=
t might be yours for several days. The other bedroom was custom built for=
 a former tenant who was a DJ, so doesn't have any windows, an italian fr=
iend of mine will be staying there at the same time.=20
Kitchen has all the basics (fridge, stove, oven), the water pressure is g=
reat.=20
Tall ceilings throughout and a lot of diffuse natural light. The windows =
are fogged for privacy on the bottom half; what you can see above the fog=
ged part is trees and sky, which is nice/novel to wake up to in the morni=
ng in NYC. There's a heating unit in the apartment.=20
Rental price includes heat+electricity+internet+Netflix.
I want people who will find themselves at home not only in this loft but =
also in the building, which is largely full of friends and friends-of-fri=
ends, and has a wonderful community feel to it. Everyone is respectful, q=
uiet, and low-key. Pets are not welcome. Smoking is not permitted in the =
apartment.
There's a huge roof where people keep small gardens and hang out. There's=
 laundry in the basement and the apartment itself comes with a large, pri=
vate storage unit in the basement. The super lives next door and the land=
lord has lived down the hall for the last decade, so the building is well=
 maintained, tidy, and with great amenities. It's easy to see why there's=
 very little turnover in this building.
Please contact me with a little bit about yourself if you are interested =
and hope to see you soon.

$1,850.00 Per Month, Ditmas Park, Brooklyn, 850 sq. ft., Beautiful / Quie=
t / Big - Furnished Brooklyn Retreat
Available: Aug 15, 2014 through Nov 15, 2014

This is the best apartment I've had in Nyc, and I've had plenty.  I've be=
en here almost a year and am moving in with my girlfriend as soon as poss=
ible. =20

The 1st floor brownstone apartment is somewhere between a 1 and 2 bedroom=
 place--it's big and bright and feels like home.  The front half of the a=
partment has a large living room, a large middle room, and a closet with =
shelves.  Included here is a big comfy couch, a desk and chair, bookshelv=
es, coat rack, shoe rack, etc.  The middle room currently has my queen be=
d, a pirate trunk, and a armoire type thing.  Then there is a hallway lea=
ding to the back half, comprised of a pink bathroom, a super functional a=
nd well used kitchen with really nice ceramic stuff / decent knives / nic=
e appliances, and finally a big bright back bedroom that I use for music =
/ yoga and storage.  It's a great space.

Important!  This brownstone backs up right on top of the Q-train, meaning=
 that you are aware of its presence.  It has never woke me up or disturbe=
d me in any way, even in my nastiest of moods, but it is there and you sh=
ould know that.  On the other hand it's literally a 30 second walk away f=
rom the Cortelyou Road stop and I get door to door to Herald Square in mi=
dtown in 35 minutes.  Its an awesome train.

If you like Nyc but want some space and peace I highly suggest you check =
out Ditmas Park.  It is like a small laid back version of Park Slope.  I'=
ve lived in the city a total of 6 years and living here has kept me sane.=
  Prospect park is an 8-10 min walk away and Cortelyou Road has a small b=
ut vibrant bar / restaurant scene.  It doesn't feel like the big city.  I=
 can't explain how special it is to me.

My lease is up Nov 15 and if you are looking for a temp place, or a place=
 to eventually take over, get in touch!  I can't wait to move in with my =
lady and I can make this work asap, I wrote Aug 15 as the available date =
but I'd be open to something asap.  Ask questions and come check it out. =

choose. There is also a very big old gazebo with arts &amp; crafts detail=

of Millbrook, NY, 10 minutes from Pine Plains, 20 minutes to Rhinebeck or=
 Red Hook. There are amazing restaurants everywhere, plus the best farm s=
tand in the area is few minutes away with local produce, cheeses, breads,=
 meats, all organic and amazing.=20

I am an artist and writer and have lived here for 10 years, made many pai=
ntings &amp; drawings in the space, written and published 5 novels and se=
veral anthologies. I don't mean to go all California but this place has g=
reat karma. I am only leaving because my personal life has changed radica=
lly.

$650.00 Per Month, Manhattan/Brooklyn/Queens, New York, Want to come to N=

Available: Sept 01, 2014 through Nov 30, 2014

Hello! My name is David Starzyk, I am an actor, father of two teenage son=
s, husband of 23 years, and I live in Los Angeles. I have been a working =
actor for over 20 years; a veteran of TV, films, and commercials.=20

What with all of the work currently going on in and around New York City,=
 I have been encouraged by my agents to come to The Big Apple this coming=
 Autumn, to try and secure work.=20

I lived in NY for some 10 years, 21 years ago, so am quite familiar with =
Manhattan, and all the Boroughs. Being a Dad, with boys in school, I have=
 many personal and financial responsibilities to my family, who are going=
 to stay in LA during my sojourn. In fact, the reason I am even consideri=
ng is to keep food on the table, etc.=20

I am looking to find a house-sitting/temporary sublet situation, with the=
 caveat being that it must be reasonable, as I will have to maintain my h=
ome life in CA. I am neat, (how could I have stayed married all these yea=
rs otherwise?!) easy to live with, I cook, and I will not be a bother. If=
 anyone knows of any situation that meets these needs, please let me know=
. At present, I am actually here filming, with a return to LA probably th=
e 31'st. Thank you.

$900.00 Per Month, Anywhere, Brooklyn, Girl and Goldie Dog Brooklyn Bound=

Available: Aug 01, 2014 through Mar 01, 2015

You know that kind of quirky, loud, but super sincere and secretly sensit=
ive friend that your friends are always telling you about? Yea, thats me.=
 My name is Cassia Lafour, a 25-year-old spicy food lover, and owner of a=
 man dog named Bear. Im an avid jewelry designer and illustrator, and lov=
e to spend my time on /r/reactiongifs, /r/diy and /r/wtf (Reddit). I am a=
 notorious cringe- and dad-joker. I have a dry sense of humor at times, a=
nd appreciate most humor in others.

Currently, I live in North Carolina. I came here from South Carolina, and=
 before that I moved from Detroit, Michigan. I work as a server in a rest=
aurant called Glasshalfull. I enjoy my work, but would eventually like to=
 work toward becoming a tattoo designer/artist.

Ok, now for the nitty gritty:

I posted that I want to live in Brooklyn, but I'm also open to Queens or =
other interesting areas.

I plan to drive down to New York on August 31, and would like to be in a =
new place on September 1. I am making one stop near DC to stay in a hotel=
 so I can give myself some rest before a long day of settling in and adju=
sting to the new place. I hope to find a place right at or under $900, wi=
th a deposit of $900 max. I do anticipate taking one trip up before my fi=
nal date so I can see whichever place(s) Ive narrowed my search down to, =
so there will be few surprises when I am there for good. (If this changes=
, like if I stay with a friend for a week instead, thats ok too.)

I plan to travel with as little as possible, so a furnished place is pref=
erred. I still have a lot of my belongings from when I lived in my own ap=
artment that I moved out of a month ago, but am selling/have sold a lot a=
lready. I plan to hang on to just a few of the staples, but can easily de=
part with whatever if it turns out that your place has what I need.

Im looking for people who enjoy being social but can appreciate quiet tim=
e. Someone who I might be able to strike up a friendship with over drinks=
 and a smoke, but who is comfortable if we are just friendly on a basic l=
evel. I definitely would like to live with someone who is reasonably clea=
n, or at least cleans up after themselves on a regular basis. I am more t=
han happy towing the line from time to time, but need the other person to=
 return the favor in kind for my sanity. Someone who loves to cook, is ge=
nerally artsy, has a hankering for environmental change in the apartment =
from time to time is my kind of person. Someone who is good at sorting co=
nflict without being insulting is very preferred. Cats are great (Bear te=
nds to learn to be terrified within 24 hours).=20

While were talking about him, just a little on Bear:
He is a two-and-a-half year old Retriever Collie who loves to run in open=
 fields and dog parks, loves to warm your feet with his body, and loves a=
 sneaky treat from my friends. He is pretty quiet, but is noisy when new =
or unexpected visitors come to the door (were working on his voice modula=
tion issues here). Also, whoever I live with has to be ok with knowing th=
at I expect good behavior from Bear and expect the other person(s) to res=
pect that. I am very serious about Bears manners, and even though we aren=
t perfect, generally hes a great dog due to the degree to which I am cons=
istent and set boundaries. Some example rules are Bear is not allowed to =
jump on people or furniture, bark uncontrollably, run out the door withou=
t consent, or enter the kitchen or bathroom (especially if theyre big eno=
ugh for him to enter). I am always learning more as I go along with how t=
o respond to Bears body language and behavior - each new situation gives =
me an opportunity to learn more about how we relate and understand one an=
other. And things change in various situations. Bear is up to date on all=
 of his vaccines, and I keep a semi-consistent flea/tick treatment going =
since I bathe him pretty consistently all around (at worst, he smells mil=
dly funky).

$2,000.00 Per Month, Fort Greene / Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, Creative Seeki=
ng 1 Bedroom Apartment - Fort Greene / Clinton Hill: Very Flexible Move-I=
n Date (anytime in the upcoming months)
Available: Aug 15, 2014

Dear Prospective Landlord,
I hope this message finds you well. My name is Sanae,=20

I'm a 31 year old single woman in search of a new home. I would love to b=
ecome your new favorite tenant!

I've found myself on this search a bit unexpectedly but such is life one =
door closes and another opens-- my new home will be even more amazing tha=
n the one I have now, I'm sure.

I work as a freelance creative, I can do just about anything with regards=
 to aesthetic and design. This also means if your space needs a little fi=
xing up, I would be more than happy to give it some love-- I'm really gre=
at at these sorts of things.=20

As a tenant I am very quiet and respectful of my space, neighbors, and co=
mmunity. I always pay my bills on time and truly make my space my home an=
d sanctuary. I don't smoke or have any pets, though I do love animals. My=
 present landlord would be more than happy to give me a great reference.

My budget isn't very big, I know I'm looking for quite the needle or gem =
if you will in a haystack but I would consider adjusting my budget for th=
e perfect space. I've lived in this neighborhood for years, I love it so =
much and truly have made it my home. Fortunately I have a lot time and fl=
exibility with my move-in date it can be anytime in the upcoming months, =
finding the right space is most important to me-- though ideally I'd like=
 to move before September.

I am looking for an unfurnished (ideally pre-war) space for long term lea=
se, I'm open to lease take-overs as well for under $2k.

I am open to two room / alcove studios but I really think I need a true o=
ne bedroom to accommodate my furniture, I'm aware this will be a difficul=
t find.

I am not looking for a share situation but a place of my own.=20

Thanks for taking the time to read this.=20

Warmest Regards-
Your Future Tenant

$1,800.00 Per Month, Within an hour commute of NYC, Any, Culinary student=
 seeks furnished apartment for Sept thru Nov
Available: Sept 01, 2014 through Nov 30, 2014

40-year-old female seeks furnished sublet for September through November,=
 and possibly December. I moved here from the mountains of CA (near Yosem=
ite) to attend a vegetarian chef training program at the Natural Gourmet =
Institute for Culinary Health. Country mouse has moved to the city. : )=20=


I am looking for a studio or 1-bedroom apartment (not a share) for me and=
 my two cats during this period. I am quiet and like to spend my time rea=
ding, writing, going on long walks, and playing in the kitchen. The cats =
are quiet too (they are adults) and enjoy napping in the sun. We are look=
ing for a place that has some natural light and a kitchen with the basics=
 (i.e. a stove/oven, not just a hotplate).

The only preference for location is that the place be convenient to publi=
c transportation and within an hour's commute of my school (Flatiron Dist=
rict). And that it be relatively safe for me to walk alone the nights tha=
t I come home late from class. Interested in any of the boroughs as well =
as across the river in NJ.

My budget would allow around $1800 per month; that is somewhat flexible d=
epending on other costs (i.e. estimated utilities). What else? I do not s=
moke. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions, and thanks for y=
our consideration.

$250.00 Per Month, Sunset Park / Gowanus, Brooklyn, 200 sq. ft., seeking =
minimal studio share (1-2 days/week)
Available: Aug 15, 2014

Hello,
I am seeking a minimal studio share, ideally in Sunset Park or Gowanus --=
 or anywhere convenient to F / G / R trains (I will be living in South Pa=
rk Slope). Will consider other areas.

I mainly need storage, but would like to have the option to use the space=
 1-2 days per week.

I work primarily in video, photography, sculpture, and installation. (But=
 I avoid using toxic materials and only minimally use tools/make dust)

I am interested in something long term, at least a year ideally.

Willing to negotiate terms

Thanks!

Dalston, London, 1600 sq. ft., Want to rent or swap my Dalston bible conv=
ersion?
Available: Sept 09, 2014 through Sept 15, 2014

Hello
We rent our flat out occasionally.
We are also visiting NYC from 9 to 15 September so very keen to swap.
Hello

We have a 3 double bedroom flat to rent in the best block in Dalston. Wit=
h a huge open plan living room, beautiful art on the walls and furniture =
on the ground, this really is London loft living at its very best.
=20
The largest (and nicest) is within its own huge mezzanine, so whilst it i=
s open plan and doorless, it has proper stairs leading up and light and s=
ound is well blocked.
=20
Bedroom 2 is large with a double bed and plenty of storage.
Bedroom 3 has a sofa bed so that it can also be used as a study. We can s=
upply a cot on request. Both are north facing.

All the rooms have their own unique character with huge attention to deta=
il, plenty of books to read and lots of peace, comfort and quiet.
=20
Though in the heart of things (The Superstore, Mangal  and Birthdays are =
within spitting distance), the flat is in a tranquil leafy gated developm=
ent. Rich in history, the flat is a conversion from what was once a bible=
 printing factory and we can see the spire of St Marks Cathedral from the=
 flats south facing windows. One of the bedrooms is in a loft, the other =
2 at the back of the flat. The loft bedroom, whilst the most beautiful we=
 think, is opened on to the rest of the flat yet I have never found the n=
oise a problem as it is blackened out.
=20
Nearby is jam packed with London's finest restaurants and bars. Our perso=
nal favourites are Mangal2, A Little of What you Fancy, Ivy's mess Hall a=
nd Buen Ayre on Broadway Market. The weekend is brimming with markets whe=
re you can buy food and fashion. Both Broadway and Stoke Newington Farmer=
s markets are within a 20 minute walk and Ridley Road is 2 streets away.

There are 3 tube stations within a 12 minute walk: Dalston Kingsland, Dal=
ston Junction and Hackney Downs. Where you want to go from there is entir=
ely your call, though we reckon people are unlikely to leave the area.
As art collectors, with all sorts of goodies at home, we hope to attract =
people who appreciate beauty, history and therefore will love and respect=
 our home and come again and again.

I'm afraid this is a 'no party' flat, though I'm sure plenty can be found=
 in the neighbourhood. That said, people have often lamented their failur=
e to leave it because it is so wonderful to stay in.=20
I can also supply a parking place on request.
