$200.00 Per Month, Clinton Hill/Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, 250 sq. ft., Finished basement space available for artist/musician/etc
Available: Dec 01, 2013

Price is negotiable from $200-$500.

I have a finished basement below my one bedroom apartment on Classon Avenue, near the Classon G train.  It's approximately 250 sq feet and is currently empty because I don't require the use of that much space.  It is a true basement in the sense that one must enter from my apartment and there is no natural light, but in the past it has been used as storage, band rehearsal space, artist space, a Pratt student indie book exchange, etc. There is access to a yard which gets great morning light in the warmer months.
 
Whoever takes the space is welcome to use the apartment's bathroom and kitchen when here.

$250.00 Per Month, Gowanus, Brooklyn, 140 sq. ft., Great studio share in Gowanus!
Available: Nov 15, 2013

Hello -

I am currently looking for an artist to share my studio. It would just be two of us using the space, we each pay $250 per month, with first and last month needed to move in. Its available now, or could start Dec 1 if preferred. The space is 140 sq feet, including a 14 ft wall available for use. It's newly renovated, with nice natural light from open ceiling. Heat, electricity, wifi, bathroom (with shower), slop sink included, as well as an exhibition space. Work only, no live in. It's a month-to-month rental but I am looking for someone long term.

I work a freelance job outside the studio and will not be using the space daily, which often gives the other artist the space to themselves. I am looking for someone with a similar situation. Great for an illustrator, graphic designer, or someone working on smaller scale pieces....

$500.00 Per Month, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Desk space for creatives at The Bakery
Available: Nov 14, 2013

The Bakery is a cross between a coworking and an artist studio space. It was founded earlier this year by 2 friends, on the foundation that community is the most important catalyst to productivity. The goal is to recruit a group with as much diversity as possible because, when you work in a creative field, variety is the spice of life!
 
	Finding members has been a slow process but, with only 7 desk spaces remaining, we are feeling extremely confident in our group. We have freelancers in film, graphic design and architecture, programmers, painters, photographers, surfers and people working on projects that can't even be described in a listings ad.

	Not only do we refuse to let ourselves be pigeonholed, we insist on retaining an element of vagueness that makes us open to pretty much anyone working in any creative field.

$550.00 Per Month, Park Slope, Brooklyn, 80 sq. ft., Pied a terre in Park Slope!  Affordable and private!
Available: Dec 01, 2013

I am a single woman with a small, furnished extra bedroom in my apartment on the third floor of a townhouse that I rent out as a part time residence.  I'm looking for someone who lives in another city, but spends time in New York for work or otherwise- I'm basically offering a pied a terre in Park Slope.  The apartment is quiet and the room is private, with access through a hallway to the living area, kitchen, and bathroom.  This is not a share, you would be the only person living in the room, but the small size (lofted queen size bed, small dresser, small desk and chair), best lends itself to part time living.  Price may be negotiable for the right person/situation.  I am a respectful, quiet working musician, and have lived here for 6 years.  One quirk of the building is that the (very sweet, mostly blind) elderly landlords live on...

$966.00 Per Month, Crown/Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, Great area, swell roommates, friendly cat... it lacks only you!
Available: Dec 01, 2013 through Mar 01, 2014

Hey there!
I'm Adam, and my roommate Sasha and I are looking for a roommate for December 1-March 1. The room, pictured, is great - cozy (not cramped!) and private. Some of the furniture in the pictures will not be present, so you'll have more space for your stuff.

Public space is important to us, so the apartment has bunches of that as well: a big, well-lit kitchen and a TV room where we invite friends every Sunday night to watch whatever is on (Mad Men, Game of Thrones and Downton Abbey have been our jam lately).

If you have a minute, you can get a nice peek at the apartment by going to 12:50 in the video at this link (https://vimeo.com/46572291), which is an episode of a show that Sasha and I made last year.

If there's anything wrong with the room, it's that we live in a busy part of town so occasionally it's a little loud late at...

$600.00 Per Month, Ditmas Park, Flatbush, but open to other locations in or out of Brooklyn, NY, Easy-going and Focused Dance Artist Seeking Harmonious Refuge in the City
Available: Dec 01, 2013

Hi, all!  My name is Kjerstin, and I'm a 27-year-old, female dance artist looking to take over your lease, or sublet your room, in a shared apartment or house starting December 1.  I currently work afternoons/evenings in Park Slope, so surrounding neighbourhoods would be ideal, but I'm open to other locations both in and out of Brooklyn.  

I'm easy-going, often described as calm or mellow, and am focused on my work.  I spend most of my time out- taking classes and auditions; rehearsing, performing, and working as a Barista- but tend to be a bit of a home-body in my down time.  Which is why it is important to me that I find a harmonious living environment, a refuge within the City.
Although I value time and space to myself, I also enjoy sharing the occasional beer, glass of wine, or meal, and love to cook some mean (mainly) vegan...

Howdy all! My name is Charles Taylor and I'm hoping to find either an apartment or room to rent that is in the ballpark of $1.3k to $1.5k per month! Open to what you might have - keeping in mind my commute to midtown-Manhattan considering that I have a full time job with steady income. 

Availability is flexible!

I know it's tough to offer up a space to someone you don't know but I'm very interested in going the extra mile to make you comfortable with allowing a stranger to rent you space. I'm interested in studios, 1-bedrooms, apartments in brownstones, a condo - or even roommate situations! Looking for a place that's comfortable and nice. Will take care of the space as if it was my own - I'm originally from the south so be sure to see a touch of southern hospitality. 

Feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns. It is...
