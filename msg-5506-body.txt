Hello, 

We have a study taking place on Tuesday January 7th, 2014
and Wednesday January 8th , 2014 , in Manhattan, paying $85 via check.
We are looking for males 18 - 35 who own a cellphone. There are several
time slots available, select the one that works best for you

 If you
are interested in applying:  

* Visit www.nyfocusgroups.com/projects
[1] 

* Click "apply" next to the group you are interested in. 

The
survey you will be filling out is just an eligibility survey and you
will not be compensated for filling it out. 

FAQ

I've been applying
for studies, but I haven't been picked. Why? 

It could be a number of
reasons. Perhaps the study is already full or you didn't meet all of the
criteria we were looking for. Don't be discouraged! You won't be
accepted for every focus group. Keep trying and you should get an
opportunity! 

It could also be that, the number you provided in you
profile isn't working, or you didn't provide a number for us to reach
you. Please take the time to update your profile, to ensure that you
have provided a current phone number. 

Thank you for your time and if
you have any questions please feel free to contact me.
