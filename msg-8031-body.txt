Hi Alex,

This is a friendly reminder in case you weren't aware of your free cloud storage account, which is still available to activate now!

We teamed up with HostMonster recently to give you a chance to back up your digital life securely in the cloud. 

With your free account, you will be able to backup your PC or Mac, as well as all of your mobile devices and then share your files with whoever you want. We'll even give 10 of your friends and family free accounts to do the same!

In terms of security, you'll be able to set automatic backup schedules so you never lose a file again. Plus, we've even got you covered if your device is stolen as we can help you track it down with the help of our Find My PC feature. 

Activating your account takes seconds, just follow this link:
http://www.justcloud.com/hostmonster?83431

If you'd prefer not to protect and share your files in the cloud and would like to stop receiving these emails, you can unsubscribe using the link at the bottom of this email and following the instructions.

Kind Regards,

Jamie Heathorn
