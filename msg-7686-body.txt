Hello everyone. I just signed a lease for a studio at 47 Hall St. in Clin=
ton Hill. It is currently a raw open space that being built out and will =
be completed by October 1st. I am looking for any photographers that woul=
d be interested in such a space to share. Here are the specs:=20

- 900 sq/ft (30' x 30' with 3 large sets' of windows)=20
- 12 ft ceilings=20
- passenger elevator=20
- freight elevator open till 6pm daily=20

- nice flat .5 mile walk to the G train.=20

And now here is what will be inside the studio:=20

ine=20

 ample time to shoot for everyone. As of now 3 spaces are already taken, =
so only 3 more slots to be filled. If you are interested please respond w=
ith your contact info, website, and a little something about yourself. Pl=

lable in Ridgewood, very high ceilings, private sink, secure building wit=
h 24 hr access
Available: Sept 01, 2014

I'm a painter, so wall space is very important to me and this studio has =
tons of it. There isn't a window to the outside, but ventilation has neve=
r been a problem as the space is very airy and open and I use odorless mi=
neral spirits when working.=20
The Jefferson L stop is 3 blocks away and there are many bars/restaurants=
/coffee shops/bodegas in the area. There's access to a freight elevator a=
nd 24 hour access to the building.=20
This spot would be perfect for another painter or 2-D artist for whom wal=
l space is also crucial. The floors are big enough, but not huge. There's=
 definitely room for a desk or table. I get along well with people and am=
 happy to rearrange my things to fit your needs as well.=20
This is a great price for a space this size and in the area.=20

$1,150.00 Per Month, Park Slope, Brooklyn, Prime South Slope 1 BR in 2BR =
for Super Roommate
Available: Sept 15, 2014 through Aug 31, 2015

This is the best place I've lived in New York in 9 years.  It has high ce=
ilings, ceiling fans, a big bathroom, kitchen with old ceramic tub, dinin=
g area and good cabinet space.  It has North, West, and Southern exposure=
 and has old, hardwood floors throughout.

The room is narrow but long (6.5' x 13'), has high ceilings, a large wind=
ow, and your own ceiling fan.  It fits a twin or full bed easily although=
 a queen can go in there but not much else.  You can put up shelving to i=
ncrease floor space.  Paint it what you like, just return it to white whe=
n you go.

We share the large closet that's directly outside your room (neither bedr=
oom has a closet sadly). =20

It's on the second floor of a three story building (only three units tota=
l), it's prewar with character.  It's two avenues from Prospect Park, it'=
s half a block from everything on 7th Avenue: restaurants like Fonda, Thi=
stle Hill Tavern, Talde, Applewood.  It's a 7 minute walk to the F at 7th=
 Ave and ditto the R at Prospect.  It's near awesome grocery shopping at =
Union Market and you can work out at the Armory Ymca that is two blocks a=
way.  C Town on 9th street delivers same day! Laundry is around the block=
.  It's a sublime location.

I want it to feel like a collaborative space and if you have living area =
furniture or dining furniture that will work easily. =20

Come check it out...there's so much sky.  And it's all yours for 14 hours=
 a day on the days I'm working.  I'm a 32 yo, Registered Nurse in the cit=
y (3-5 days/week).  If you are a 9-5er or work night hours it's perfect. =
 Even more perfect if you are also in your 30s, are hilarious, have great=
 buds, a steady gig, and would consider adding a cleaning lady to the lis=
t of things that are awesome and worth paying for, because that's just ho=
w I roll these days.  :)

There is no lease for you to sign, just a 30-day (month-to-month) agreeme=
nt and provide first months rent and one month deposit on moving in. =20

Cheers,

Kate

$800.00 Per Month, Springs, East Hampton, Lovely off-season Hamptons shar=
e with artist/academic family
Available: Oct 01, 2014 through May 15, 2015

Hello! We are a family of writers, artists, and academics living between =
Pittsburgh, Brooklyn, and East Hampton. We are looking for a responsible,=
 laid-back person (or possibly couple) to share our lovely retreat house =
in East Hampton Springs, NY from October through mid May 2015. You could =
live in our beautiful country home full time or use it as a getaway when =
your schedule permits. Need a break from the City? Want to work on that b=
ook or project you've been meaning to finish? You'll find that The Hampto=
ns during the off season is gorgeous and finally (mostly) emptied of clam=
oring tourists. If you imagine yourself sitting by the fire with a glass =
of wine, reading and writing in a house of creative scholarly types, look=
 no further.=20

For $800/mo + shared utilities, you would occupy one of the first floor b=
edrooms, that can come furnished with a queen bed and writing desk, and s=
hare the downstairs bathroom, family room with working fireplace, and gor=
geous gourmet kitchen. We have a beautiful backyard and deck with a grill=
 for Fall/Spring cookouts and we are a short 15 minute walk to the beach.=
 Springs (as it is known to the locals) is a charming, historically artis=
tic and working class enclave in The Hamptons that has been home to such =
luminaries as Jackson Pollack, Lou Reed, and Laurie Anderson. We are sure=
 youll find it as relaxing and inspiring as we do. You should be lgbt-fri=
endly and love dogs. Sorry, no additional pets! =20

We are a short 5 mile drive/cab ride from the East Hampton Long Island Ra=
ilroad station and about the same distance to the Hampton Jitney stop. Th=
e village of East Hampton has a downtown area with plenty of shops, bars,=
 restaurants, services, and a movie theater. We are within walking distan=
ce of a pizza shop, general store, and wine shop, however, the closest gr=
ocery stores are between 1 and 3 miles away. There is a public bus in the=
 town of East Hampton that you can catch a couple blocks from the house, =
but it would probably be most convenient for you to have a car.

We look forward to hearing from you!

$1,337.50 Per Month, Park Slope, Brooklyn, Bright Room in Park Slope 2-Be=
droom
Available: Oct 01, 2014

The second bedroom in my apartment will be available, furnished, from Oct=
ober 1 onward. Rent is $1337.50 plus utilities and internet, usually abou=
t $55/month. 1 month security deposit.

You really don't need to bring anything but your suitcase, and hopefully =
you won't because although the apartment is a nice size, there isn't that=
 much space for more stuff. Although there is certainly more room for art=
 on the walls and we can always make space for books.

The apartment is clean, cozy, charming, fully furnished with great renova=
ted bathroom and kitchen (dishwasher, microwave, gas stove). The room has=
 a full/double bed, a closet with plenty of coat hangers and a chest of d=
rawers. It's about 6.5x14 feet. The bedrooms are on the opposite ends of =
the apartment, so privacy is not an issue. We have very nice neighbors an=
d a friendly, helpful landlord.

I'm a 35 y/o gal -- I teach writing at college and I also write myself. I=
 work from home a lot and like to keep the place reasonably (not obsessiv=
ely) clean. Also living here is a very friendly labradoodle, who does not=
 shed or bark inside (to my delight). I'm easy-going and social, but I al=
so need my personal space. I like having friends over and dinners and som=
etimes parties, but I also like having quiet cozy time at home.

The apartment is in Center (Park) Slope - a very easy neighborhood to liv=
e in. Every convenience is within a few blocks of the apartment (gourmet =
and cheap groceries, drugstore, post office, gyms, restaurants, shopping)=
. Prospect Park is 2 blocks away. We have several great cafes within 1-4 =
blocks, including Almondine french bakery just downstairs from us. Barbes=
, down the block, is one of Brooklyn's best bars for music. The F and G t=
rains are 20 steps from the door, and will take you directly to or near m=
ost of the fun neighborhoods in Brooklyn (5-20 minutes) and Manhattan (20=
-40 minutes). The R train is 2 1/2 blocks away. You can also easily walk =
through many of Brooklyn's loveliest neighborhoods within 30 minutes of t=

We're looking for another roommate to join our home!=20

The story: weve lived in this apartment for 3 years. One of our roommates=
 is sadly moving on and we need someone to takeover her room &amp; her po=
rtion of the lease. That person could be you!

About your future roommates: You'd be living with 3 other roommates  2 me=
n and 1 woman, in our mid 20's. 2 of us are working professionals, one is=
 in nursing school. (So were usually gone during the day and home nights =
and weekends). Were big on cooking, movie nights, and generally hanging o=
ut and having good conversation, but we wont be offended if youre not aro=
und much. While we do sometimes have social occasions at the apartment (w=
hen everyone is cool with it), we mostly like to use it as a place to rel=
ax.=20

About your future apartment: 2 story, with shared spaces (kitchen, living=
 room, bathroom) on the 1st floor and private spaces (bedrooms) on the se=
cond; Private Backyard complete with outdoor seating, grill, hammock, and=

About your future Bedroom: About 15x15 ft with 2 large windows facing the=
 private backyard.=20

Who you are: We're looking from someone laid-back and friendly who gets a=
long well with us. We keep a pretty tidy apartment so wed be looking for =
a roommate who cleans up after themselves, is respectful of our things, a=
nd is willing to split responsibilities on the bigger jobs (like cleaning=
 the bathroom) once in a while. We have a great relationship with our nei=
ghbors too since weve lived here so long so this someone would be respect=
ful in terms of noise level well. Sorry no smokers or pets.=20

Were not looking for temporary subletters so youd be someone planning to =
stay for at least a year (if not longer) &amp; willing to co-sign our lea=
se.=20

The term is for one year (Sept 14  Sept 15). Our roommate currently plans=
 to move out by Oct 1st, but that date is flexible if you need to move in=
 earlier/later.=20

If all of this sounds promising to you email back to meet us and see if y=
oud be a good fit! Wed love to hear from you!

$1,100.00 Per Month, Crown Heights, Brooklyn, 1100 sq. ft., Private Room =
w/Private Bathroom
Available: Sept 06, 2014

Roommate wanted to share a beautiful 2 bedroom/2 bathroom apartment in no=
rth Crown Heights. Available starting Sept 7. Rent will be pro-rated acco=
rding to move-in date.=20

Apartment: Big, open layout. Lots of windows. Full kitchen with separate =
dining area. Large living room. Very nice sized terrace (currently being =
renovated). Kitchen has everything it needs, and the living room is fully=
 furnished. You don't need to bring anything but things for your own room=
. Building is filled with mostly friendly neighbors- families who have li=
ved here for a long time and young professionals moving in.
Laundry in basement.

Room: Good sized (unfurnished) room with corner windows that face the bac=
k of the building. Past roommates have fit a full sized bed, desk and dre=
sser with no problem. Private bathroom located off the room with access o=
nly for you through your bedroom. It has a toilet, sink and a shower. Roo=
m has its own closet with a place to hang things as well as shelves above=
. There is also a coat/boot closet in the living room to share. Separate =
space to store your A/C unit in the winter.

Me: Friendly, quiet, respectful, and fun female. I am a professional who =
keeps fairly consistent hours: work 8-4ish in Manhattan. I'm also an amat=
eur aerialist who spends time on the weeknights and weekends rehearsing, =
etc. I have two small dogs who are super friendly, attention-lovers. I sp=
end a lot of time with them at the park down the block in the mornings an=
d evenings. I'm very independent and busy most of the time. I don't have =
a lot of people over or entertain frequently. I cook at home most nights,=
 but it's mostly simple meals- in and out of the kitchen quickly. I'm a l=
ong-time Brooklyn resident (almost 17 years). I love going to the beach f=
or the day, college football, watching documentaries on Netflix, and bein=
g upside down.

What I'm looking for:
Roommate (male or female, no couples!), non-smoker, who works consistent =
hours (not at home) and has a steady income. Someone who loves dogs- not =
just in the &quot;oh, dogs are cool&quot; kind of way... more along the &=
quot;hell, yeah, I love puppy kisses!!!&quot; kind of way. You may also h=
ave a dog of your own if the situation works: our dogs get along and we h=
ave similar styles of care for our pets (ie: you don't leave yours in a c=
age from morning until night). I'd like someone that I can have conversat=
ions with, but we don't necessarily have to be best buds. Someone who is =
independent and looking for a quiet place to come home to at the end of t=
he day is key. I'm not looking to share my home with someone who is going=
 to bring home random people, frequently wants out of town guests to stay=
 with them, or likes to entertain a lot. This apartment is very much my &=
quot;home&quot;, and the space is best suited for someone who wants and a=
ppreciates the same.=20

Shared expenses: electric, gas and internet split 50/50. Cable is negotia=
ble. I can take it or leave it. Currently have it but the bill is huge be=
cause Cablevision won't give me a good package anymore because I've been =
a customer too long (crazy!). So, if we decide to have cable, it would ha=
ve to be in your name. They are more likely to give a good deal to a new =
customer.

Neighborhood: &quot;Historic&quot; North Crown Heights... whatever that m=
eans! It's mostly residential. I've lived here going on 5 years, and the =
neighborhood keeps getting better and better. Small park (Brower Park) do=
wn the block with off-leash hours for dogs and a great community of dog o=
wners. A few blocks north of Eastern Parkway.=20
Nostrand Ave is one block away and has new restaurants and coffee shops p=
opping up all the time. Franklin Ave is a 10 minute walk. Prospect Park i=
s 20 min.
Trains: A/C @ Nostrand, 3 @ Nostrand, 2/5 @ President
Buses: B44 express to Williamsburg just a couple blocks away

Photos: some of the decor has changed and the photos of the actual bedroo=
m don't do it justice! Best seen in person.

ncrease.=20

uilding does not advertise on craigslist or via a broker. The tenants are=
 predominately late 20's to earl 40's, artists and young business owners.=
 Strong surfer community. No children in building. Laundry in building, l=
arge rooftop for residents and a portion dedicated to those who want to h=
ave a rooftop garden. There is a bike garage in the basement where bikes =
are hung as they aren't welcomed in apt. There is a also a private parkin=

ks for a large restaurant group. I'm in the middle of opening a new resta=
urant so work 6 days/nights a week. usually gone from noon-11pm. I work a=
 lot but plan to relax on all that in the near future. I am mellow and ha=
ve built a home that is a refuge from the chaos of the city. I am from th=
e mountains of West Virginia so have created a home that captures a littl=
e bit of that country living from the use of non-chemical cleaners, the u=
se of organic materials and no plastics. It is a unique way of living and=
 may not be for everybody but looking for someone who gets it. I am super=
 clean and sensitive to bad smells and cat dander so keep things super ti=
dy. I don't watch Tv, don't own one but I do read a lot. I bring a lot of=
 wine home, cook at home and keep my fridge stocked with organic, non-che=
mical induced goodies. I am very focused on sustainable living, compostin=
g and recycling. I am focused on healthy energy in the apartment. I don't=
 have parties and am all about keeping good zen. I camp a lot, travel to =
vineyards in other countries and try to leave on the weekends. I surf the=
 summers, snowboard in the winters and rock climb indoor and outdoors. Lo=
ts of concerts, movies, getting groups of friends together for horseback =
riding trips up north and hiking adventures.=20

You:
Female in her 30's-40's who views their home as a place to relax rather t=
han a place to crash or a place to bring parties to. (The apartment is to=
 small for someone who constantly has a boyfriend over) You are clean!! (=
If you can walk across a floor and find your feet to be dirty and that do=
esn't ignite you to want to sweep and mop....we aren't sharing the same d=
efinition of &quot;clean&quot;) You don't need to be asked to clean or ne=
ed a schedule. You are financially sound and can more than afford your bi=
lls. You have been in your current profession for a considerable amount o=
f time and don't jump from employer to employer. (If you sit around and d=
rink soda, watch some tv show about housewives or celebs and have no inte=
rest in current political affairs....we most likely aren't going to be go=
od roommates) You aren't on medication for depression or have any emotion=
al, bipolar or suicidal tendencies (not a fun roommate). You like to deco=
rate, design, build, or are artistically inclined. You're happy, enjoy wh=
ere you are at in life and as an individual. You are cognitive of yoursel=
f, your environment and energy. Can afford shared expenses of cleaning pr=
oducts and housing needs. You don't smoke (420 okay, no drugs ), you are =
okay with living in a house where no shoes are worn inside, and most impo=
rtantly....you Love you some kitty! To be honest, this is a great place f=
or someone in yoga or the arts.=20

I'm open to someone with a pet but it's greatly dependent upon the situat=
ion and the type of pet. (no yappy poochies) Please send me some info on =
you and a link to any social media you might have. I can provide the same=
 to you.=20
Happy hunting!

$1,200.00 Per Month, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, Beautiful room in Greenpoint!
Available: Oct 01, 2014 through Oct 01, 2015

Hello! My roommates moving to Europe at the end of September, so were loo=
king for someone to take over his room in our lovely 2-bedroom in Greenpo=
int, starting October 1st. We live on the 3rd floor of a 3-story walk-up =
with an attentive landlord and friendly, quiet tenants. Its less than 5 m=
inutes to the Nassau G and multiple bus lines, and a 10-minute walk to th=
e Bedford L. Very close to laundry, bars, grocery stores, coffee shops  b=
asically anything you need. The common space has an open kitchen, large m=
arble countertops, and double-height ceilings with skylights; beyond a ta=
ble, desk, pictures and plants, weve kept the furnishings sparse, but the=
res more than enough space for additional furniture.=20

About The Room: The open room is approximately 10x15, with great sunlight=
, multiple inset shelves, and a large closet space just outside. It overl=
ooks a private backyard area, so its nice and quiet. My roommate currentl=
y has a queen-size bed, dresser and desk in the room with enough space le=
ft over to work comfortably on his large-format paintings.=20

About Me: Im 30/M and work full-time as a freelance arts writer/editor. I=
 often work from home, but Im out most evenings attending openings, doing=
 studio visits, or whatever else. As a roommate, Im quiet, clean, and eas=
ygoing, and I dont have people over to the place very often, so you wont =
have to worry about it getting too loud or crowded. In my current situati=
on, weve done a good job of making our place feel like a home  peaceful, =
comfortable, etc.  and thats something Id hope to continue.=20

About You: Im looking for someone who is (a) employed full-time, (b) does=
nt work from home, and (c) able to commit to a 12-month lease. Im not at =
all particular about living with men or women, gay/straight/whatever  all=
 that really matters is that we get along and that, as a roommate, youre =
as friendly, courteous, and responsible as I try to be.

Rent Agreement: Rent is $1200 + utilities (internet, gas, electric), whic=
h usually add up to around $70. The landlord requires proof of full-time =
employment (paystubs or copy of contract(s)), as well as anything else th=
at demonstrates financial stability (credit score, bank statement, guaran=
tor agreement, etc.). He also asks for one months rent ($1200) up front a=
s security deposit. Sorry, but no pets.=20

Im looking to find someone sooner rather than later, so if youre interest=
ed, drop me a line and well set up a time for you to come see the place!

$850.00 Per Month, bedstuy, Brooklyn, Spacious 1 bedroom in 2 bedroom Bro=
wnstone
Available: Sept 05, 2014 through Jan 31, 2015

We're relisting after we have had to do some bathroom renovations so the =
move-in date is a bit flexible. Someone before the 15th is ideal-any time=
 before is negotiable.=20

The apartment is located 2 blocks from the G line on the Myrtle-Willoughb=
y stop, on Willoughby Ave, between Marcy and Nostrand.
The J/M train (Lorimer St.) is located about 15 mins away too.

The room is huge--I have a queen-sized bed, a moderately-sized desk, and =
a drawer and still have plenty of room for other furnishings.
Also the room features a walk-in closet with tons of space, not just for =
clothes but also storage.
There's two big windows in the room that face out to the backyard.

The apartment is on the first floor so there's access to a private backya=
rd. For any green thumbs, it's the perfect size to start a nice garden, o=
r a BBQ for any foodies.

You'll be living with my current roommate, who's a big art-aficionado and=
 makes a mean cocktail.
She's great and has been living in this apartment for years, and has a go=
od relationship with the landlord.

All utilities are included with the $850 rent, with the exception of inte=
rnet &amp; electric, which is $40 a month total.

A security deposit and 1st month rent is due (total: $1700) if my roommat=
e and landlord approve.=20

$1,200.00 Per Month, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, Beautiful, sunny room with har=
dwood floors on a quiet Greenpoint street
Available: Sept 07, 2014

Gorgeous room available now in a great three-bedroom apartment in Greenpo=
int!=20

Room is a nice size, well-lit, faces quiet, tree-lined Huron street. Hard=
wood floors.

The apartment is sunny, has a nice living room and access to an amazing l=
ittle backyard with a grill and hammock. It's in a free-standing brick bu=
ilding with a stoop! Brand new stove and fridge in the kitchen.=20

The Greenpoint G train stop is a 6-minute walk, the Vernon-Jackson Boulev=
ard 7 train is a 15-20 minute walk, the India Street ferry stop is a bloc=
k away. Buses galore. The river with its lovely piers is down the block -=
- one could say you'd be right where three boroughs meet.

Laundromat, bodegas, grocery stores, bars, restaurants are all close by.=20=


Move-in is September 7, or whenever you want, I just need the pro-rated f=
irst month's rent (so for three weeks). Security deposit is one month's r=
ent. The lease is in my name, so we would just sign an agreement between =
us. That said, I am looking for someone long-term.

I am a journalist in my mid-twenties, a Greenpoint native, though I spent=
 my teens in Europe. Liberal arts college graduate; skier; book, art and =
soccer-lover. Laid-back and easy-going, would like to have the common spa=
ces clean, but I am uptight about it. I work from 12-8 p.m., so our sched=
ules probably won't collide. Would like to keep it on the quiet side duri=
ng the week, but your friends are always welcome. I have some people line=
d-up for the third room, but no specifics yet.=20

Your bedroom would be 11.5 x 8 feet, and features a tall, south-facing wi=
ndow. The room can fit a queen-size bed, dresser, and small desk. There a=
re three (very!) large closets in this apartment, and you would have excl=
usive access to the closet directly adjacent to your room in the living r=
oom. You would also be able to have additional storage in the walk-in clo=
set near the apartment's entrance.=20

The apartment is furnished except for the second bedroom; I just moved in=
 September 1 and so am still decorating/unpacking. You would share the ap=
artment with me and my 35-pound well-trained, quiet dog.=20

About me: I am 28 years old and work in digital publishing in Midtown. I =
am easy-going, clean, and quiet and am seeking someone with similar quali=
ties. When I'm not at my 9-5, I like to exercise, spend time with my dog,=
 bake desserts, go out for dinner and wine with friends...and occasionall=
y binge-watch Orange is the New Black.=20

I am asking $1150 per month for the room, and an additional $1150 for sec=
urity (which you would have returned to you at the end of your stay.) No =
fees--I have already paid the broker's fee. Looking forward to hearing fr=
om you soon!

$1,100.00 Per Month, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 90 sq. ft., Sunny Room in 2B=
R Apt in Heart of Williamsburg
Available: Oct 01, 2014 through Jul 31, 2015

I have a room open October 1st in a two-bedroom/one-bath, 2nd floor walk-=
up apartment on Metropolitan near Bedford Ave. in Williamsburg.=20

About the Apartment
The location is ideal -- right across the street from the Williamsburg Fo=
odtown, a ton of laundry options within a few blocks, and just a 5 min. (=
max!) walk to the L at Bedford, 10 mins. to the Metropolitan Ave. G train=
, and 15 mins. to the J-M-Z at Marcy Ave. Apartment is also a block away =
from buses to L.I.C., a couple blocks from the East River Ferry, and righ=
t across the street from a Citi Bike station. There is also a car service=
 on the block that will get you to the local airports for cheap -- last I=
 checked, J.F.K. was $30 flat.

I love and take advantage of all the above transpo options, however, one =
of my favorite things about the apartments location is that I can easily =
walk across the Williamsburg Bridge into Manhattan and catch a film at Su=
nshine Cinema, I.F.C, or Film Forum -- its a super simple and super gorge=
ous walk to do on a sunny afternoon.

This should give you a sense of where the apartments located in terms of =
all the bars, dining, music venues, and shopping the neighborhood has to =
offer -- which is to say, its right in the middle of everything. (Lucky D=
og is my go-to space for a drink.)

Apartment gets plenty of light, and the room comes with a window-unit A.C=
. (its 3 years old, but in good working order). My current roommate can f=
it a queen bed, desk, short bookcase, and small drawer unit in there. We =
also have roof access and gorgeous views, but its by no means a finished =
roof deck-type situation.

To be fully transparent, the apartments got a couple downsides:

+ 1 closet -- as in, the apartment only has one clothing closet, and its =
in the living room. I am by no means a clotheshorse, and am always trying=
 to pare down my wardrobe (I like to tell myself this is chic). Basically=
, I am flexible and confident we can work something out if you feel this =
may be an issue.

+ Small bathroom &amp; sink -- as in, pretty small. My roommate and I usu=
ally wash our faces using the sink over the tub, to avoid unnecessary wat=
er on the floor. Ive gotten used to this, so its a non-issue for me now -=
- plus, I figure its a small sacrifice for otherwise comfortable digs. Bu=
t if you love/need a big vanity and spacious throne area, this is not the=
 apartment for you.

+ No dishwasher -- not uncommon, but just a heads up. I usually do dishes=
 shortly after I use them, or at least before I go to bed.=20

Rent &amp; Monies
Rent is $1100/month, and utilities are usually an additional $60 per pers=
on max (sans cable), +/- about $10 depending on the communal supplies we =
go through -- I like to save receipts and split the cost of stuff like to=
ilet paper, dish soap, and the occasional cleaning product at the end of =
the month.=20

First and last months rent gets you in ($2200), and I will ask you to sig=
n a pretty standard sublease agreement. The lease is through July 31, 201=
5, and I would prefer a roommate that can commit to the full 10 months.

About Me
I am a woman in her mid-twenties working in the independent film industry=
. My favorite filmmaker is Jim Jarmusch, with a healthy appreciation for =
the literary works of John Waters. Currently, I am on a Sebadoh / Ty Sega=
ll listening kick, and enjoy mellowing out to T. Rex. I am a big fan of l=
ow-maintenance houseplants, and in my spare time I like to try new recipe=
s, play bass, and sometimes do embarrassing workout videos in the living =
room.=20

I am looking for a roommate who not only pays rent + utilities on time ev=
ery month, but is also considerate of keeping communal spaces tidy and ke=
eping communication open, i.e. discussing and resolving any issues before=
 things get anywhere near passive aggressive. That sort of thing. I am al=
so lgbtq friendly. I have been lucky to live with awesome people thus far=
, and am hoping my luck continues!

Want to know more?
I am happy to answer any additional questions you have about the apartmen=
t or me. If you would like to know more and arrange a time to come see th=
e place, please shoot me an email telling me a bit about yourself -- what=
 you do for a living, what you do for you, etc. Thanks!

$1,350.00 Per Month, Park Slope, Brooklyn, 500 sq. ft., Lovely sun-filled=
 bedroom available in North Park Slope 2BR apartment
Available: Sept 10, 2014 through Jan 31, 2015

I'm looking for someone to sublet my room in a great Park Slope 2 bedroom=
 apartment. The apartment is located on Douglass St. btwn 4th and 5th Ave=
.; great neighborhood - tons of restaurants, bars, shopping, grocery stor=
es, everything. Very safe and lots to do. Also located about a 10 min wal=
k from Atlantic Terminal which connects tons of trains so you can get pre=
tty much anywhere in the city quickly.

It's a 4th floor walk-up, newly renovated - new appliances including a di=
shwasher! Good amount of counter space in the kitchen. The bedroom itself=
 is on the small side but I was able to fit a double bed, dresser, book s=
helf, small desk, and keyboard piano. And the bedroom has spectacular win=
dows - amazing natural light, great view, great cross-breeze for the fall=
. The living room area has a nice couch, big TV. My roommate who you'd be=
 living with is a very nice guy, pretty clean, isn't home too much during=
 the week (works a lot).

The rent is $1,350 per month. I'd be looking for someone to sublet my roo=
m from Sept 10 - Jan 31st, priority given to people who may want to take =
over the lease in February. I'm only moving because I found an amazing de=
al on a studio that I just couldn't pass up - my roommate is a great guy =
to live with and the apartment is really wonderful.

Looking forward to hearing from you,
Ruth

Over the past eight years we have transformed a former steam fitter's sho=
p into an ideal home and work space. It is currently configured as a one =
bedroom, two and a half bath home and studio, but it could easily accommo=
date additional bedrooms. The space could be reconfigured in a variety of=
 ways due to the open plan of the building.

Features of the property include two 7'x7' pyramid skylights, wood and re=
finished concrete floors, a new roof, windows and doors, french doors to =
a large patio, established perennial gardens including a privacy stand of=
 bamboo, stainless steel appliances, washer/dryer, and unique built-ins f=
rom the building's former life. A favorite item is an original 4'x10' woo=
d table that is the centerpiece of the studio space. There is a new 10'x1=
2' wood shed and all of this sits on a quarter acre lot.

 for Sublet
Available: Oct 01, 2014 through Dec 31, 2014

Large Alcove Studio available as of October 1.

My wife and I are moving out and have 3 months left on the lease which ex=
pires at the end of December. =20
If you are interested in leasing the unit afterwards you can get pre-qual=
ified with the leasing office, which is a pleasure to work with.

About the apartment: =20
Large alcove studio.  Very big for one person and big enough for 2 people=
 (a couple). =20
-The kitchen is fantastic with lots of cupboard space and a full size gas=
 stove
-The closet space is great and this is coming from a couple that has way =
too much clothing
-This unit faces the courtyard - great views of trees and neighboring bui=
ldings and is very quiet
-2 Laundry Rooms
-Dry Cleaner in building
-2 Elevators
-24/7 Security Guard
-Package Center
-The unit's layout is unique, and allowed for bed, couch &amp; chairs, ba=
r stools, and still had enough room to throw down 2 yoga mats or unfold a=
 table to seat 8 people.
-We were quoted that the unit is 500sq ft which leads me to believe that =
every other quote I've ever gotten at other apartments is nonsense, as it=
 feels much bigger.

I have lived in several apartments in city including Olympia House in mid=
town, a Jakobson property in the village, and a walk up on University Pla=
ce, and I have nothing but good things to say about this building, manage=
ment/super, leasing office, and the apartment. =20

ars &amp; restaurants.

My name is Allie, I work in the financial services industry and I recentl=

October 1st.=20

I am hoping to move during the last weekend of September to a neighborhoo=

artment.
=20

2007, sociology.
I work in client service for commercial banking and I do photography in m=
y free time
My Myers-Briggs type is I S F P
My sorority voted me &quot;best personality&quot; in college and I don't =
care if anyone thinks that's lame or cheesy, it felt like the last scene =
in Miss Congeniality &amp; I loved it
I'm a middle child with an older brother and a younger sister &amp; my pa=

I don't cook often, but I am great at not leaving dishes in the sink when=
 I do. I used to have a roommate that really valued a clean sink so now i=
ts a permanent habit.
Messy people don't scare me and neat freaks don't scare me either. I just=
 don't like weird smells and dirty surfaces/dirty floors/trash/etc.

Id love to discuss / answer any questions you have, just let me know!

$1,200.00 Per Month, Manhattan, Brooklyn, New York, Looking for long-term=
 sublet or furnished room / apartment
Available: Oct 01, 2014

My current sublet is running out in October and I would like to take the =
chance to move a bit closer to my workplace and experience another neighb=
orhood in the city.

I am tidy, responsible, reliable and financially stable, don't smoke and =
do not own any pets. In general my belongings are rather minimal, so I wo=
uld prefer a furnished place for rent or a sublet, for at least a few mon=
ths. My working schedule keeps me busy, every now and then also on the we=
ekend, but sometimes I also like to (quietly) work on some stuff at home.=


Probably you will find me pleasant to be around. I have many different in=
terests, worked in art, music and science, and wouldn't mind moving in wi=
th somebody nice, but am also content on my own.

Please message me and ask questions.

Since I found my current place via Listings Project and am more than happ=
y with it, I hope it will work a second time. :)

$2,000.00 Per Month, Fort Greene / Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, Creative, Seek=
ing 1 Bedroom Apartment - Fort Greene / Clinton Hill: Very Flexible Move-=
In Date (anytime in the upcoming months)
Available: Sept 15, 2014

Dear Prospective Landlord,

I hope this message finds you well.

My name is Sanae,=20

I'm a 32 year old single woman in search of a new home. I would love to b=
ecome your new favorite tenant!

I've lived in my neighborhood for years and it's been nearly 4 months now=
 that I've been searching for my new home. Ideally, I need to move anytim=
e before mid-October but can wait for the right space.

I work as a creative, I can do just about anything with regards to aesthe=
tic and design. This means if your space needs a little fixing up, I woul=
d be more than happy to give it some love, its what I do best!

As a tenant I am very quiet and respectful of my space, neighbors, and co=
mmunity. I always pay my bills on time and truly make my space my home an=
d sanctuary. I work a lot and I do not smoke nor have any pets. My presen=
t landlord would be more than happy to give me a really great reference.

I know I'm looking for quite the needle or gem if you will in a haystack.=
 Fortunately I also have a lot flexibility with my move-in date, finding =
the right space is most important to me.

I am looking for an unfurnished pre-war space for long term lease, I'm op=
en to lease take-overs as well.

I am open to two room / alcove studios but I really think I need a true o=
ne bedroom to accommodate my furniture, I'm aware this will be a difficul=
t find.=20

I am not looking for a share situation but a place of my own.=20

Thanks for taking the time to read this.=20

Warmest Regards-
Your Future Tenant
