$550.00 Per Month, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, 200 sq. ft., Charming office/stu=
dio available in prime Greenpoint  (includes utilities)
Available: Feb 01, 2015 through Feb 01, 2016

A semi-private space is available Feb. 1st (flexible) for sublease in my =
studio, approximately 200 square feet for $550, utilities included (heat =
&amp; electricity). The ceilings are 11 feet high, so it feels larger. Th=

 in the back and completely private with a door, while your space is in t=
he middle, divided from the other studio with a partial wall, which goes =
all the way up to the ceiling. There are no windows, but abundant wall sp=
ace and a small storage loft. Perfect for a painter.

The charming space has one exposed brick wall, and original details of wo=
od ceiling, beams and floor. It feels very comfortable and homey in there=
, great place to work. The photos feature my previous studiomates&#39; st=
uff, but it&#39;s best to take a look at it in person and see how you wou=
ld set it up yourself.

There is a freight elevator, mailbox, slop sink, clean bathrooms, and 24-=
hour access to building. Many artists and creative professionals in the b=
uilding.

Amazing, prime location, just 2 blocks from the G at Greenpoint Ave and w=
alking distance to tons of great bars, shops, and restaurants.

), loud machines, or toxic materials. I require first month&#39;s rent pl=
us 2 months security deposit. The lease is for one year, but if you need =
to leave before then, you can give me 45 days notice.=20

$600.00 Per Month, Clinton/Washington G train, Brooklyn, 2000 sq. ft., De=
sign Coworking/Making Collective looking for Members and Cofounder
Available: Feb 15, 2015

Hello!

We are two friends with professional architectural &amp; furniture design=
/fabrication backgrounds looking to start a design coworking/collective w=
hich helps enable the New York creative design community get hands on wit=
h their ideas. Our focus on anchoring this idea at this very moment is to=
 lease a space which can service prototyping and studio making needs and =
build our community around this hub. Our long term goal is to attract lik=
e minded designers and makers who share the same values and create a coll=
ective. We have been reviewing spaces to lease and have finally found one=
 which we feel serves our needs and longer term mission. We are discussin=
g the terms and conditions of the lease, and while we haven&#39;t signed =
anything, it does not mean our mission is tied to this exact space. IF we=
 gain more critical mass and contributors, it means we can go bigger. We =
are looking for members/renters and 1 other co-founder of the collective =
who all will be able to contribute to the start-up costs of the lease and=
 initial equipment furnishing (table saw, joiner, planer, band saw, etc).=
 We see the opportunity with this space to have a small cafe and clean, s=
unlit computing space.

What makes us different from 3rd Ward or any other shared workspace? Actu=
ally, we met at 3rd Ward in the 1st/2nd wave of 2009 and [I] saw it thru=
 to the bitter end. (It was sustainable btw) Currently we were looking fo=
r a space to prototype things in and while we were searching, we found th=
at theres a lack of access to workspace, a lack of an everyday place for =
active designers to get together, and we miss the old days- the creative =
environment, people who know how to have fun, the parties (not to mention=
 kind of bored with our jobs). Rather than a catchall, we are focusing on=
 our specific community of furniture/product designers who are eager to m=
ake things.

The vicinity is the off the Clinton Washington G train area a stones thro=
w from the Navy Yard, accessible from the G Train and a short walk from P=
ratt Institute. This actually up and coming, if not already came area, is=
 home to many artists, designers, professional fabricators. Next year, th=
e highly anticipated New Lab will be slated to open across the street. Go=
ogle it. Rather than wait to see if it opens and what terms they offer, w=
e rather to make our own way and see where it takes us. We currently are =
discussing with a few contributing members who seem cool, and, we would l=
ove to talk to you!

In your reply, please briefly introduce yourself, why you are interested,=
 and what you do, how you can contribute. We will get back to you shortly=
. Thanks for reading!

It is a quiet studio; everyone has different schedules and it is rare tha=
t two or more people are in the entire space at once. We are a friendly a=
nd relaxed group who have known each other for years, looking for a serio=
us and considerate artist to join us. We are a mix of sculptors and paint=
ers, working in mixed media, but nothing that is noxious or which invades=
 others&#39; spaces. We help each other if and when needed, yet also high=
ly respect each other&#39;s privacy to focus on his/her work.

What is absolutely not tolerated:=20
--Maltreatment of the space (damage, not participating in helping maintai=
n the common area, sink or trash)=20
--Any activity that disrupts others&#39; ability to work in the space (ex=
cessive noise, dust, fumes, etc.)=20
--Late rent=20
--Smoking in the studio=20
--Parties or social gatherings in the space (unless organized together or=
 run by everyone)
Serious inquiries only from persons who are reliable and responsible. Tha=
nks!

ably-priced, South Slope artist's studio sublet
Available: Feb 15, 2015 through Sept 15, 2015

I&#39;m writing a memoir and subletting my 400 sq-ft artist&#39;s studio =
in South Park Slope, beginning February 15th, for at least 7 months--unti=
l mid-September, 2015, or longer--we can talk. The $700 rent includes uti=
lities and internet.

It&#39;s really nice. On the ground floor of a small artists&#39; buildin=
g, it has two windows and a door that opens out onto a back courtyard, wh=
ich creates a good deal of light and air. The studio has 12&#39; ceilings=
, a slop sink, and good fluorescent lighting, with plenty of power and ou=
tlets for incandescent lights and equipment. The overall 800 sq-ft space =
is shared with a couple of visual artists working in the other half of th=
e space, separated by partial walls and two enormous curtains. Because it=
&#39;s on the ground floor in an old, well-insulated building, it doesn&#=
39;t get too hot in the summer, and there is good baseboard heating (new =
boiler!) the rest of the year. There is a good drafting table/desk with a=
 chair, a futon couch, two large empty shelf units, and an empty filing c=
abinet.

The studio is on a cross-street between 4th and 5th Aves, a couple of blo=
cks from the Green Wood Cemetery, around the corner from the best pizza p=
lace in Brooklyn, Luigi&#39;s, and on the same block as the great Girasol=
 Mexican Bakery.

The landlord, an artist himself, is happy to help with any issues that co=
me up.

$1,100.00 Per Month, Bushwick, Brooklyn, 800 sq. ft., Clean, Modern Room =
in Lovely Bushwick 2BR: 1.5 Blocks From L-Train, Laundry &amp; Gym in bui=
lding!
Available: Mar 01, 2015 through Mar 01, 2016

Hi there! My name is Samantha and I&#39;m a 24-year-old working female lo=
oking for an awesome new roommate to share my amazing 2-bedroom/1 bath Bu=
shwick apartment starting on March 1st, 2015.=20

Why the apartment is amazing:

-1.5 Blocks from the L-Train!=20
-24/hour access gym open to all tenants
-Laundry room inside the building=20
-Balcony
-Central heat/air
-Elevator
-Parking lot
-Security alarm system
-Modern, brand new appliances=20

The apartment is located in a great, safe area of Bushwick; bodegas one b=
lock away in either direction, adorable coffee shop right on the corner, =
near plenty of good restaurants and local bars. About a 5-minute walk to =
Maria Hernandez Park.

More about me: I work full-time at a non-profit in Manhattan, and also do=
 writing/blogging on the side. I&#39;m very clean, non-smoker, and take p=
ride in having a cozy, clean, comfortable home! I&#39;m not a party girl,=
 don&#39;t host lots of people over at once, and generally prefer a quiet=
 home environment. If I&#39;m not out with friends on the weekend, then I=
&#39;m reading, writing, or Netflix binge-ing in my pj&#39;s. (If you lik=
e House of Cards, Madmen, or Orange is the New Black, then we&#39;ll prob=
ably get along!)

About you: I&#39;m seeking a (preferably) female roommate who doesn&#39;t=
 smoke, and is either a full-time student or has a full time job. Please =
be the type of person who does their dishes, takes out the trash when it&=
#39;s full, and generally just acts in a way that is considerate and kind=
 (and I will, of course, return the favor!) No pets allowed, unfortunatel=
y :(

Overall, this is a wonderful apartment and I&#39;m hoping to find someone=
 equally great to share it with. If you&#39;re interested in the room, pl=
ease send me an e-mail with more information about you (what do you do, w=
here are you from, what are your own personal roommate requirements) and =
I&#39;ll get back to you about arranging a time to see the apartment.=20

Looking forward to meeting you!

$600.00 Per Month, Bedstuy, Brooklyn, Rooms available in Housing Cooperat=
ive!
Available: Mar 01, 2015

We are a community of people working together to reach the goal of a more=
 sustainable way of living. We&#39;re rejecting the New York &quot;fend f=
or yourself&quot; attitude and collectively building a strong alternative=
 to individualistic consumer culture.  By living together, sharing food, =
space, and projects, we are more able to fulfill our personal and collect=
ive goals.=20

We&#39;re 14 people and a cat in a 4-story brownstone with a huge kitchen=
, four bathrooms, a living room, and a backyard. We purchase food and sup=
plies collectively, shop at food co-ops and receive local csa shares. We =
garden, compost and care for two chickens.  We host dance parties and eve=
nts and often have movie and game nights.  Some things our members do wit=
h their time include: learning, educating, art-making, music-making, comp=
uter programming, activism, bike riding, dumpster diving, childcare, wood=
 carving, Geoguessing, cookie-baking, collaborating on impromptu meals, s=
inging along to disco songs, and staying up till 3 a.m. solving logic puz=
zles. =20

The success of our co-op requires the regular participation of our member=
s. New housemates should expect to dedicate at least 3 hours each week to=
 our house, which includes a weekly chore and kitchen maintenance. We als=
o require attendance at our weekly dinner and meeting (every Monday at 8:=
30 pm) where we discuss house issues and make decisions by consensus proc=
ess.=20

There are three rooms available. Two rooms are available for March 1st: a=
 medium-sized room without a window; a small room with a window.=20

One room is available for April 1st: a small room with a window.

All three rooms are $540-600 per month. We also pay for food collectively=
 and share utilities (approximately $125/mo). Please note that we cannot =
accept any more pets in the house.

Public transportation is the C/S train to Franklin or G train to Bedford/=
Nostrand or Classon Ave. We&#39;re a half a block away from the Y, bike l=
anes, and a number of bus routes.

We don&#39;t discriminate based on race, age, gender, sexuality or gender=
 identification. We just require a commitment and a positive attitude. Se=
nd us an email letting us know who you are and why you are interested in =
cooperative living. What can you contribute to this community? Please be =
descriptive.  Thanks for your interest!

$900.00 Per Month, Sunset Park, Brooklyn, Approx. 130 sq. ft., Spacious a=
nd sunny 2 bedroom share in Sunset Park
Available: Mar 01, 2015

I&#39;m looking for a roommate for 3/1 for my gorgeous apartment in Sunse=
t Park.=20

I&#39;m on 40th Street between 6th and 7th Avenues. Floor through apartme=
nt in a semi detached row house - lots of light! It&#39;s so sunny it is =
hard to photograph during the day.

Tons of plants, my cat Miss California, Chicken &amp; Chorizo the parakee=
ts, and Frank Finatra the fish. No other dogs or cats please but someone =
in a tank/cage/bowl would be welcome!

Rent is $900/month + $75 for wifi/gas/electric. I&#39;ve got level billin=
g so no surprises. The room is about 11&#39;x11&#39; with one window and =
presently comfortably holds a queen sized bed, two large dressers, an end=
 table, and a large book case. Decent sized closet for your use is in the=
 hall.

Shared spaces include a cozy eat in kitchen with lots of storage, a perfe=
ctly nice bathroom with a full tub, a huge living room with a Roku, a lar=
ge entrance room that could easily accommodate a desk if you had one or a=
 bookshelf, and a big walk-in closet for things like coats/air conditione=
rs/holiday ornaments/suitcases/etc.

I&#39;ve been here going on three years, land lord is upstairs and very s=
weet. It&#39;s a really homey block where people look out for each other&=
#39;s kids and socialize on the stoops in summer.

I&#39;m 30, Puerto Rican, from Jersey City. I work full time in administr=
ation at The Met and tend to go to bed early. I&#39;m gone 7:30ish to 7:3=
0ish every day. I cook a lot! I smoke but never in the house. I drink som=
etimes in the house, and will have a friend over for dinner once a week o=
r so but nothing rowdy.=20

My cat is elderly and sweet. Her litter box is in my bedroom so you won&#=
39;t have to deal with it at all, and she won&#39;t go in your bedroom un=
less invited. She&#39;d happily cuddle with you if permitted though!

Hopefully you are a cat lover, employed, tidy, ok with being considerate =
of noise after 11pm on weeknights and would like to watch Doctor Who with=
 me sometimes. It would be great if you could provide proof of employment=
 and/or a few recent pay stubs. Ideally you are established here and not =
brand new to the city.

To keep everything above board: I attend Al Anon regularly and am not abl=
e to share my living space with alcoholics, in recovery or otherwise.

The apartment is fully stocked and I have everything you could want short=
 of a blender. Bonus if you come with one!

To review: March 1st $975/month (rent+utilities) with a $900 refundable s=
ecurity deposit paid to the land lord.

No lease, it&#39;s month to month. Land lord would give me a lease if I a=
sked but I like the flexibility.

$1,050.00 Per Month, Washington Heights, Manhattan, Seeking 1 new roommat=
e for beautiful 3 bedroom apartment! Plenty of space with awesome roommat=
es!
Available: Feb 01, 2015

Hi! New to the market is 1 room to rent in a beautiful 3-bedroom apartmen=
t in Washington Heights/West Harlem! Located on W 157th between Amsterdam=
 and Broadway, it is close to the 1 train (and C train), groceries, coffe=
e shops, Planet Fitness, churches, and places to eat!

I recently found out that I am moving back to Miami for work and will be =
leaving New York on the morning of February 13th. The room is available a=
t that point. Should you need to move in any time before then, I can be o=
ut of the apartment at any time.

Here&#39;s all the info you need to know!

1. I have two fabulous roommates right now who are staying. One is a 29-y=
ear-old (female) working professional -- busy all the time! The other is =
a 30-year-old (male) who is also a working professional in the food indus=
try. We consider our home, our home and you&#39;ll love it too. Everyone =
here loves to laugh, watch &quot;reality&quot; tv, listen to music, go ou=
tside for a run along the Hudson, and experience new places to eat around=
 the city.

2. The living room and kitchen are furnished (pics attached to this post)=
. With that said, you must be respectful of others&#39; property. Treat t=
heir things as your own and always pick up after yourself.

3. The apartment is very spacious, which is hard to find in NYC. We have =
exposed brick along the hallway and in the smallest bedroom. New(ish) app=
liances that all work fantastic -- dishwasher included. There&#39;s laund=
ry and an elevator in the building even though we are only on the 2nd flo=
or. The neighborhood is pretty fun! It&#39;s becoming more gentrified and=
 has always been safe for as long as I&#39;ve been here.

4. The room you would rent fits a queen bed comfortably, decent size clos=
et, plenty of space for your other things. I&#39;ll even leave my brand n=
ew air-conditioning window unit in the window for your convenience.

5. Your bathroom is adjacent to the bedroom and has a shower/tub and sink=
. Very clean and no problems. You would share it with the male roommate w=
ho is very clean. We&#39;ve had zero issues.

What I&#39;m looking for to fill my space when I leave:
 A working professional who is respectful of others (everyone welcome)
 Someone who likes to have fun but also enjoys quiet time
 Must be financially responsible

Rent is $1,050 per month, all inclusive (rent, heat, hot water, cable, wi=
reless internet, electric)

Cost for you to move-in:
 $350 for paperwork/lease  Lease ends July 2016
 $525 for February rent should you want to begin occupying the apartment =
on Feb. 13 -OR- $1,050 should you want a March 1 occupation date
 $1,050 security deposit

$1,200.00 Per Month, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Room for rent in beautiful W=
illiamburg brownstone
Available: Feb 15, 2015

Hello

I&#39;m looking for a new roommate as of February 15th.=20

The Space:

This two bedroom apt is on the third and top floor of a brown stone, tons=
 of windows facing South and North. We have the entire top floor, which i=
s fantastic (less noise/we can make more noise). There are beautiful/orig=
inal hardwood floors throughout. There are two entrances from the stairca=
se, but don&#39;t worry, this is not a railroad. Your bedroom is 10&#39; =
X 15&#39; and has one large window. There is a large closet right outside=
 your door that is all yours, and there is another large closet in the ha=
llway off the living room with your name on it. We also have a closet in =
the bathroom where you could store towels, an air conditioner, etc. The m=
oral of that story is: closet space is no issue.. Since we have the top f=
loor to ourselves you could also store a bike out by the staircase (That&=
#39;s what I do.) There is a large bathroom with full bath and it has a s=
kylight. Large living room leads into kitchen.. Everything is new.. I was=
 the first person to live here after it was renovated. Living room is fur=
nished and kitchen supplies are plentiful. We do have private roof access=
, as well. It&#39;s great for screening movies with a projector in the su=
mmer.

Here&#39;s a little about me:

I&#39;m a busy 28 year old professional. I work in video production, as a=
 director, producer, and writer. I&#39;m a gay dude, so you would have to=
 be comfortable with that. Gotta feel comfortable in your own house right=
? A typical weekday night for me includes a stop at the gym, coming home =
to cook something up (I like to share) or going out to dinner, watching s=
ome HBO or whatever morsel of entertainment goodness is happening that we=
ek. I do have to get up early most days, so someone with a similar schedu=
le would be great. Though if you&#39;re a night owl (which I naturally am=
) there is plenty of space for you to do your thing minus the dance party=
.. Weekends are a different ball game. Though generally I like to keep th=
e ragers to outside of the apt. I like interacting with the person I live=
 with. I think it&#39;s nice. Share a beer etc. I guess it goes without s=
aying, but I&#39;m also looking for someone who is neat and cleans up aft=
er themselves/pitches in with chores.. I&#39;m no neat freak, but I like =
a clean house. I&#39;m sure you do too.

The Location:

The apartment is located on South 9th St. and Bedford Avenue. It&#39;s ab=
out 5 minutes to walk over to the J M Z trains at Marcy or 15 minutes to =
the L at Bedford. The J M Z is great in the morning. It&#39;s never over =
crowded and the M takes you straight up Manhattan or the J &amp; Z take y=
ou down Manhattan. When I&#39;m not working from home, I&#39;m working fr=
om our SoHo or Williamsburg offices and bike to work every morning (Excep=
t when below 20 degrees. Winter needs to go). We&#39;re right by the Will=
iamsburg bridge bike path entrance. So, that&#39;s also an option when it=
&#39;s warmer. There are a ton of restaurants and bars within walking dis=
tance. Marlowe and Sons is a great place to grab a cup of coffee and past=
ry of your liking. Pies and Thighs is dangerous as they deliver and are v=
ery near as well. There is a huge new supermarket on Broadway where I usu=
ally do my shopping. They deliver your groceries for free the same day, i=
f ever you decide to stock up. Also, Marlow and Daughters is great for fr=
esh baked bread, good cheese, and meats. We have a great wine-shop/liquor=
 store around the corner as well. Laundry is about 5 minutes up Berry.. T=
hey have drop off service or you can do your own.. The block is quiet, sa=
fe, tree-lined and beautiful.

The Super Fun Stuff:

So your share of the apt would be $1200+ electric, gas, and internet. Tha=
t usually brings you to a grand total of $1250/month.

I would require first and last months rent, plus a security deposit upon =
move in. So that&#39;s $3600 to move in.

I know it&#39;s steep, but since you won&#39;t be signing a real lease, I=
 have to do it. Plus my roommate will need his security deposit back and =
the landlord has that. So, it&#39;s a swap you see.

Closing Notes:

If you&#39;re interested, please shoot me an email with a little bit abou=
t yourself. I love a Facebook page as well. My last roommate and I had so=
me friends in common. Always nice. I&#39;m looking forward to meeting you=
!

Talk soon,=20

$1,250.00 Per Month, Bed-Stuy/Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, Furnished room in s=
un-filled brownstone, Feb 15, includes all!
Available: Feb 15, 2015

I have 1 furnished bedroom for rent in my 3 bdrm in Bed-Stuy/Clinton Hill=
, Brooklyn. Move in Feb 15th, no lease. Should ideally stay at least 6 mo=
nths, maybe longer if it&#39;s a good match.
Feb rent will be half price.
Female or gay/trans/queer, etc male. No straight men. (Don&#39;t lie, I&#=
39;ll know), 25+ only (I&#39;m sure your 21 y/o self is mature, responsib=
le, blah blah but I don&#39;t want to live with people significantly youn=
ger than myself).=20
$1250/month includes all utilities except a/c + $1250 security deposit. R=
eferences required.

Share the rest of this 1000 sq ft beautiful, sunny, quiet, top floor brow=
nstone in one of BK&#39;s hottest neighborhoods with me (female, 30&#39;s=
, creative, self-employed. I&#39;ve lived here for 4+ years and made this=
 my hopefully permanent home), 1 other female (20&#39;s, student, friendl=
y, lived here a few months), plus a hip lady cat (11, professional napper=
). We are equally happy hanging out together or keeping to ourselves. No =
smoking, no more pets. Must be employed, clean, and being friendly and fu=
n helps. Additionally, I frequently work from home so I can&#39;t have so=
meone hanging around the house all day, every day. This is a great place =
for someone just moving to nyc, having a changing life situation or just =
looking to live with less stuff!=20

Must be able to pay rent early on the 25th of the month and do a weekly r=
otating chore-No Exceptions. Late fee applies.

Room includes full sized bed w/ linens, closet, bookshelf, built-in desk =
w/ chair. The room is 9x12, faces the quiet backyards and is steps from a=
 shared bathroom. (Con-The closet is outside the bedroom but its big!).
Hanging out in the common areas is encouraged. The kitchen is a good size=
 with more than enough room to cook (but I prefer someone who doesn&#39;t=
 cook constantly-too many dirty dishes, space taken up in the fridge, con=
stant smells, etc) and there is a cozy common space with a projector for =
movie watching, and a dining table for brunch, game night, whatnot. I&#39=
;m in the process of remodeling the living room a little so it doesn&#39;=
t look exactly like the pictures, but close.
There are only 2 other units in the building and everyone is super cool a=
nd quiet. There is private roof access and I engage in frequent stoop sit=
ting. The apt is a full top floor of an 1899 brownstone, gets beautiful l=
ight and fresh air all day and is on a charming tree-lined brownstone blo=
ck with amazing neighbors.=20
Everyone who has ever visited my apt comments on how great it is. I&#39;m=
 not trying to brag, just laying out the facts :)

Few minutes walk to G train at Myrtle-Willoughby or Bedford-Nostrand, sho=
rt bus rides to A/C, J/M, or B/D/N/Q trains. 20 min to Union Square or Lo=

urants, coffee shops, laundry, groceries, Pratt, Ymca, parks, Citibike st=
ation, all within walking distance. Bed-Stuy has exploded in popularity o=

Requirements (seems like a lot but it&#39;s pretty standard and any norma=

 keep myself sane)
-You Must Be Clean. I cannot stress this enough.You have to do a chore ev=
ery week and not ignore it or make excuses. I am not a maid.
-Absolutely no smoking of anything anywhere in the building. Landlord rul=
e.
-No drugs of any kind and only social drinking permitted (no alcoholics, =
frequent bing drinkers).
-Must be quiet during normal sleeping hours. No loud music, tv, friends o=
ver. I&#39;m a light sleeper and it&#39;s not fair if I and the neighbors=
 have to listen to your life at 3am.
-Drama free. I&#39;m a very laid-back, easy-going person and I don&#39;t =
want to live with people who aren&#39;t.
-You must be able to pay the rent early on the 25th of the month, every m=
onth, without being reminded.
-You can&#39;t have friends/significant other over all of the time. Occas=
ionally is fine but they can&#39;t live here.
-You have experience living with other people. I&#39;ve had enough roomma=
tes in my life to know what makes a good one. If you aren&#39;t familiar =
with a shared living situation, this will not be good for either of us.
-You are responsible for yourself and your actions, and have common sense=
. I hate having to act like a mother.

Please respond with info about yourself and your availability to stop by =
and see the apartment (I&#39;m flexible). Put &quot;sriracha&quot; in you=

$1,200.00 Per Month, Crown Heights, Brooklyn, 140 sq. ft., Furnished room=
 in 2,000 sq. ft. duplex apartment
Available: Feb 01, 2015

Furnished bedroom in huge duplex apartment.=20
The bedroom comes with a queen-size bed with a very good mattress, a beds=
ide table, a big glass desk, and a chair, a chest of drawers, book shelf,=
 wall mirror and in-wall closet.
Clean pillows, duvet, bed sheets and towels provided if needed.
There is a bathroom with jacuzzi tub right next to the bedroom, to share =
with the other roommate.
The kitchen is equipped with fridge/freezer, oven, stove, dishwasher, bre=
ad machine, juicer and all the necessary kitchenware.
There is a washer/dryer unit in the apartment. Video projector and DVD pl=
ayer, fitness space and keyboard downstairs. Wifi.

I am a French opera singer, and I&#39;m the landlord. I have been living =
in this apartment for almost 5 years now and have seen the neighborhood c=
hange into what is now an up-and-coming area, with lots of shops and rest=
aurants, 5 min away from Bed-stuy with more nice places.=20

Nearby subways include A/C/3 and 4 trains, so very convenient to get to M=
anhattan (15 min to downtown Manhattan), or JFK (20min). I have two cats,=
 very friendly, they love people. They won&#39;t go in your room if you d=
on&#39;t want them to.

The other roommate is French as well, she is working for the French organ=
ization that promotes tourism to France in the US and will be here until =
May.

We are both very easy going and clean and want the same from our new room=
mate. We each take turns cleaning the common area of the apartment, so yo=
u can expect to have to take about an hour every three weeks to clean.

The apartment is quiet, the backyard isn&#39;t used by anyone but us, par=
king on the street is fairly easy, and I find the area to be very safe, a=
t any time of the day or night.

1,000$ security deposit. All utilities included.

$1,375.00 Per Month, Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, Beautiful Bright Room Av=
ailable in 2 Bedroom Prospect Heights Apartment
Available: Mar 01, 2015

Hi! My roommate is leaving the city and I&#39;m looking for someone equal=
ly fantastic to take her place.=20

About the room: Large living space with French doors, wood flooring, high=
 ceilings, and two large windows that allow for plenty of sunlight. It mo=
re than fits a queen bed, dresser, nightstand, desk, and smaller storage =
pieces. The room is available as early as February 9th for those in a hur=
ry for a home, but March 1st is definitely still great.  Roommate hunting=
 is just not my favorite activity, so I&#39;m hoping you&#39;d be able to=
 sign on for the longer term.=20

About the apartment/complex: Well-located in a safe neighborhood at Under=
hill and St. Johns Pl near several great bars and restaurants, including =
the Brooklyn Museum, Prospect Park, and just a few blocks away from major=
 subways (B/Q at 7th Ave; 2/3/4 at Grand Army, Franklin or Eastern Parkwa=
y). Walk Score is 96. We are on the third floor of a four-story walk-up a=
nd face away from the street, so it&#39;s generally pretty quiet. The kit=
chen has plenty of counter space and the separate living room area has tw=
o large closets for storage. Hot water and heat are included and other ut=
ilities come to about $40 per person. The owner lives in the building and=
 our super is pretty responsive with any needed fixes.

About me: I am a female in my late twenties and originally from Los Angel=
es who is terrible with directions, medium at trivia, and pretty solid at=
 baking banana bread. I work full-time at a human rights NGO in the city =
and attend graduate school part-time in the evenings, so I keep busy duri=
ng the week and weekends. I&#39;m looking for a mature, pleasant (ideally=
 female) roommate with a sense of humor who appreciates a clean, welcomin=
g, laid-back home life. No pets, smoking or drugs please.

Let me know a bit about yourself and when you&#39;re able to stop by and =
for a visit.=20

Thanks!

$850.00 Per Month, Williamsburg, brooklyn, Two Rooms Available in Amazing=
ly Serene South Williamsburg Loft
Available: Mar 01, 2015

Hi There!

We have two rooms opening up in our apartment that we are hoping to fill =
by March 1st.=20

The Apartment
Our apartment is located on S4th Street on the second floor of what used =
to be an industrial building used to craft rocket and airplane engines. T=
he space is loft style: high ceilings, hardwood floors, huge windows, ope=
n common/kitchen area and built out rooms. There is laundry on each floor=
, a dry cleaning service in the building and common roof access. Internet=
, heat and electric are not included in the rent.=20

The Rooms
The apartment started out as an open loft space and our last roommate bui=
lt out the rooms to accommodate himself plus three friends. There are two=
 adjacent rooms on the ground floor of the apartment with the remaining t=
wo rooms directly above them.=20

The rooms available do not have windows, however, each one has glass shut=
ters that bring in light from the common area. These can be opened or clo=
sed but regardless, will let in light. It is an atypical set up but one t=
hat&#39;s been pretty rad for those who&#39;ve lived here.=20

Room 1: $1200
This is largest room in the apartment. It can accommodate a queen sized b=
ed, desk and small dresser. There are built in metro shelves that you can=
 remove if you&#39;d like as well as a clothing pole attached to the ceil=
ing. You can also paint the room.=20

Room 2: $850
This is the second largest room in the apartment, located directly above =
the other available room. It can accommodate a full sized bed, dresser an=
d small desk. This room can be painted as well. The ceilings in this room=
 are a couple of inches lower than the other room. There is a big storage=
 space right next to the room, which is super awesome if you can&#39;t fi=
t everything in your room.=20

The New Roommates
In order for us to keep our space, you must be willing to sign on to the =
lease for at least a year, providing proof of income (the required amount=
 for combined income in the apartment is $130K). In addition, you are a c=
onsiderate, clean and responsible person who has a steady full time job. =
You can pay your rent and bills on time. You like to be social with the p=
eople you live with but know the value of personal space. You clean up af=
ter yourself and though you might enjoy going out, you will never bring t=
he party home. This is not a home for an anti-social hermit, nor will it =
be right for a party all night type. You&#39;re mature enough to have fou=
nd a balance and you embrace it.=20

The Other Roommates
We are two gals, mid 20&#39;s to early 30&#39;s. One is a colour stylist =
at a salon in Manhattan, the other is a jewelry designer/nanny. One of us=
 has a little hypoallergenic dog, but he pretty much keeps to himself. We=
 are friends and both enjoy keeping our home peaceful, fun and clean.=20

If you think you might be a good fit, email us! Please specify which room=
 you are interested in. Tell us a little about yourself, link us to your =
FB, IG, website, etc. No couples or pets. We would need first and last mo=
nths rent plus a deposit upon moving in.=20

Available: Feb 15, 2015

I am looking for 1 or 2 roommates to join me in a new apartment.

I am looking at 3 bedroom apartments in Bushwick and Bed-Stuy which seems=
 to be the best combo in terms of location and price.=20

I&#39;m a male artist and documentary filmmaker in my 30s, looking for pe=
ople in their late 20s or 30s to share the space with. Common interests a=
re great but if you&#39;re an interesting and decent person we&#39;ll get=
 along.

I&#39;m not often home as I work from my studio space in Manhattan, and a=
lso have a  research assistant position in the Princeton neuroscience dep=
artment that I go to two days/week.

I&#39;m outgoing and sociable but not looking for roommates who bring the=
 party home (unless it is a realllly good one). Also looking for people w=
ho enjoy living in a clean/tidy space (and are willing to do a bit of wor=
k to have it be that way), and don&#39;t work from home. Cooking/dinner p=
arties are good.

Short term or month-month also a possibility and I could furnish a second=
 room if you don&#39;t have furniture.

If you&#39;re interested, get in touch.

 insulated porch (see photos). $1000/ mo for each of us plus utilities. T=
he apartment will actually come unfurnished- the pictures I&#39;ve attach=
ed here are of the apartment as inhabited by the current tenants. If you =
have furniture, feel free to bring it!
A bit about me: I&#39;m a woman in my mid-thirties, and I work as a freel=
ance classical pianist. Most of my work is in the Lincoln Center area, bu=
t I also teach piano and music theory to little kids at a school on the L=
ower East Side. I&#39;m a fun, considerate roommate: I&#39;m clean but no=
t a neat freak; I never practice at funky hours (never before 9 am or aft=
er 9 pm, and I&#39;m good, I promise :-); and I don&#39;t drink, but I&#3=
9;m totally OK with people drinking around me! My idea of a great time is=
 hanging out playing board games (Cards against Humanity, Settlers of Cat=
an, you name it), listening to lps, cooking, ashtanga yoga, and arts and =
crafts (I am really into origami and knitting at the moment!), so I guess=
 I&#39;m kind of a dork. I&#39;m lgbtq- friendly and definitely on the fa=
r left side of the political spectrum. Message me if any (or hopefully al=
l) of this appeals to you!

$1,025.00 Per Month, Bedstuy/Clinton Hill border, Brooklyn/NY, Room for r=
ent March 1st in luxury loft building! Great amenities!
Available: Mar 01, 2015

Hi there:

My current roommate is moving out and I am looking for someone to take ov=
er the spot.

It is a loft-style apartment (two bedroom, one bath) located on Kosciuszk=
o St. between Bedford Ave. and Nostrand. It is 3 blocks from the G train =
stop at Bedford-Nostrand and about a 30 minute commute to the Financial D=
istrict. The building has a sweet roof deck with a view of the Manhattan =
skyline, a gym, laundry on site, and a rec room.

About me, I&#39;m a 30 year-old attorney with a very busy schedule which =
means we won&#39;t see each other much during the work week. I pay my bil=
ls on time and generally have my life together. I&#39;m looking for a roo=
mmate who&#39;s at that same stage of his/her life, meaning, you pay your=
 bills on time, you don&#39;t bring the party home, and you clean after y=
ourself. No drugs, no pets. Other than that, I&#39;m pretty respectful an=
d easygoing.

Rent is $1025 a month. Utilities are usually about $100 each.  You would =
need first, last, and a security deposit to move in ($3,075).  If you are=
 interested and it sounds like a good fit, please send me an email and we=
&#39;ll set up a time for you to see the place.

$1,200.00 Per Month, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 300 sq. ft., Great Room in S=
outh Williamsburg
Available: Mar 01, 2015

Hi!

I&#39;m looking for a roommate in my apartment. It&#39;s a super convenie=
nt location in South Williamsburg- 5 minute walk to the JMZ and a little =
under 10 to the L train.=20
It&#39;s a cozy, beautifully lit spot.=20

I&#39;m open to a bunch of options! A month stay, an open-ended thing, et=
c. The room (that&#39;s pictured empty) is furnished with a bed, lamp, dr=
esser and rug but I don&#39;t have a picture because my current roommate =
(and her things) are in there...To be  honest, it&#39;d be ideal if you w=
ere not planning on bringing too much furniture.=20

Couple things about the place (and me):=20

I work a bunch and probably want to live with someone who keeps the same =
amount of busy as I do.=20

On the scale of 1 to annoyingly-clean-and-organized-and-sparse- I lean to=
wards the annoyingly clean and organized and sparse.=20
=20
So. That&#39;s it. Let&#39;s chat. My pics don&#39;t really do the place =
justice- it&#39;s a great spot. I&#39;m just looking for a competent, rea=
lly kind, independent, fun, clean person that I don&#39;t find depressing=
!=20

I know searching for housing is hell- I&#39;ll do my best to be really pr=
ompt and clear on my end. I&#39;ll likely get back to you this weekend...=
so don&#39;t sweat it if I don&#39;t immediately respond...

Thanks!

$1,250.00 Per Month, N. Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 1 bedroom in a very prett=
y 2 bedroom.
Available: Jan 04, 2015 through Mar 31, 2015

I&#39;m looking to rent out one furnished bedroom in a lovely two bedroom=
 apartment (rail road style, with a walk around for my room.) in north Wi=
lliamsburg. One bathroom, a big fine kitchen, and a sitting room.

It&#39;s a beautiful, pre-war apartment with high ceilings, wooden floors=
, and crown molding. Our kitchen is sunny, and given it&#39;s on the 4th =
floor we have a skylight in the bathroom and a pretty view out the back o=
ver Manhattan. We&#39;ve been here for two years; the location is really =
nice, just off the Bedford L, and about two blocks from the subway statio=
n. Union Square is about ten-fifteen minutes max via subway. If times get=
 hard with the L, always the JMZ at Marcy Av as option B.

Utilities come to around $60 a month (35 for internet, 30ish for electric=
ity), to be divided between the two of us. We have laundry in the basemen=
t!

You would be sharing the space with me; a twenty something girl working f=
ull time for a contemporary art fair (every day, 10-7), so the apartment =
will be fairly quiet. But I&#39;m very easy going and friendly when I am =
around ! If this interests any of you, let me know; shoot me an email wit=
h a little background information, and we can proceed from there. Looking=
 forward to hearing from you!

1x13 feet. The room is fully furnished with a queen size bed, bedding, bl=
ankets, a closet, and bookshelves, high ceilings 13 ft, 2 side lamps, fan=

ms. 15 ft airy ceilings, retractable skylights, lots of windows, living r=
oom, dining room, lounge area, huge kitchen and tons of counter space, 1.=
5 bathrooms, claw foot bathtub. Washer in basement. Wifi. The loft has te=
mperature controlled heat all throughout so it stays quite warm even thou=
gh most spaces this large can typically get cold in the winter. This plac=
e has many amazing qualities about it. You wont see many living spaces li=
ke this in NYC, especially the size. Its unique and artistic details are =
designed everywhere into the house. One of the walls is made of entirely =
of old windows and found objects. Another wall is made of a net of tiny w=
ood blocks that drape down from the ceiling. =20

The Loft is located in neighborhood of Bushwick, Brooklyn, USA.  Close ac=
cess to the L train, Morgan or Jefferson stop, and M train Central.  Ther=
e are plenty of and great restaurants (Archies, Chimu, El Kucho, Robertas=

oklyn Health) and 2 gyms. This area has a lot of artists studios so there=
 is a lot creative energy around. Lots of stuff to do without having to g=
o to Manhattan. Thats a good thing if you want to stay local. But if you =
want to venture into the city, its about a 20 min train ride. Its only 5 =
stops away to Williamsburgs Bedford stop. Or take the M train 20 minutes =
to Lower East Side or the Bowery and SoHo.

I live here along with my other roommate. We are in our 30s, easy going, =
creative types, respectable and considerate.  The vibe of the house is me=
llow.  We dont have a own a tv and its more conducive to reading, listeni=
ng to music and hanging out with your laptop, rather than partying.  We a=
re social types but we also know when to keep to ourselves and be quiet. =
 The loft is eclectic and tidy.  Non smokers.=20

$1,100.00 Per Month, Bedstuy, Brooklyn, Big Bedroom w/ private bathroom f=
or 3/1 -3/31. All Utilites Included
Available: Feb 26, 2015 through Mar 31, 2015

Hi! I m looking to sublet my big furnished bedroom with it&#39;s own priv=
ate bath for the month of March (March 1- March 31, but you could be in a=
s soon as 2/24 if you need to move-in sooner) in a 4 bedroom duplex in th=
e heart of Bedstuy. Close to Pratt, literally a block from the Myrtle -Wi=
lloughby G train, and a short walk to the M/J at Myrtle Broadway Ave. Uti=
lities included. Will consider having a couple sublet for $1250 for the m=
onth.=20

About the room:
It&#39;s about 13 X 16 on the 3rd floor of the apartment. There&#39;s a p=
rivate full bathroom and charming fire escape that looks out to a field. =
It gets great natural sunlight.=20

About the roommates:
They are 3 wonderful girls (mid-to late 20s) who work at bars in the city=
, so the apartment is pretty much yours in the evenings. This works out w=
ell for me since I have a 9-7 schedule at an ad agency in the city. They =
are fun, respectful, tidy, and overall really kind people to live with. W=
e also have 3 furry roommates, so you must like dogs/cats (there is a 1 d=
og and 2 cats). A friend of mine will be taking my one of the cats (mine)=
 for the month of March, so they&#39;ll only be 1 cat/1 dog when you move=
-in.

About the place:
As I mentioned it&#39;s a 4 bedroom duplex. We have a beautiful open kitc=
hen (w/dishwasher) and a living room w/ a big TV and a Roku box. There&#3=
9;s coin-op laundry in basement floor of the building.=20

About the neighborhood:
The neighborhood is great! A great coffee shop is around the corner (Myrt=
le &amp; Marcy), plenty of restaurants and bars a block away (Project Par=
lor, Brooklyn Stoops, Dekalb Restaurant, Do or Dine, Saraghina&#39;s). Ou=
r corner bodega has really good, organic food/snacks/beer, and a full-blo=
wn grocery store about two blocks away. It&#39;s by far the most convenie=
nt location I&#39;ve lived in in Brooklyn to get all around Brooklyn and =
the city, which takes about 30-35 minutes to Tribeca/West Village.=20

Note: This is a fully furnished room, but the dresser/ (huge) closet will=
 be empty for your stuff. You&#39;ll get fresh linens and towels.

$1,150.00 Per Month, Crown Heights, Brooklyn, Newly Renovated 1BR in 3BR =
Right Off of Franklin Ave!
Available: Mar 01, 2015 through Aug 31, 2015

Hi everyone! I am looking for someone to take my room in a 3BR apartment =
in Crown Heights, mere steps away from Franklin Ave and its&#39; bevy of =
brunch and bars. The Park Place Shuttle is less than a block away, the Fr=
anklin Ave 2345 is about a five minute walk, and the Franklin Ave C is ab=
out a ten minute walk.=20

The apartment was recently renovated, so all the appliances are new, and =
the floors are really nice and hardwood. There&#39;s a washer/dryer in th=
e unit, and a spiral staircase that leads to semi-private roof access. Th=
e roof is only shared with one other set of neighbors, and is great for p=
arties, grilling in the summer, and the like. The living room gets great =
light during the day.

The room itself is on the far end of the apartment, away from the other t=
wo rooms and is pretty sizeable. I have a queen-sized bed, a dresser, and=
 a standing closet rack, among other things, and it doesn&#39;t feel the =
least bit cramped. It&#39;s definitely the most private of the three room=
s.=20

You&#39;ll have two roommates, a girl and a guy, who work 9 to 5s and usu=
ally keep to themselves. They&#39;re generally pretty chill, and don&#39;=
t mind if and when people or friends come over.=20

This apartment is in a great, super convenient location, and there&#39;s =
always plenty to do the Brooklyn Flea is pretty close, there&#39;s a lot =
of great stuff on Franklin, and some great shops, bars and restaurants on=
 Classon and Bedford; and you&#39;re not too far from all the good stuff =
on Washington and Vanderbilt, either.=20

Rent is $1150 per month + utilities (electricty and cable/internet). I&#3=
9;d need first month&#39;s rent + a security deposit up front, so $2300 t=
otal. You&#39;d be finishing the lease out, so staying through the end of=
 August with an option to resign in your own name thereafter. Happy hunti=
ng!

Available: Jan 10, 2015 through Jun 01, 2015

We (3) are looking for a *sublet, with the potential for longer term.=20

The apartment is and (3) M; 2 in their late 20s and 1 in his early 30s.
Two are artists and the other is a social worker, all very kind and respe=
ctful towards each other.

We are looking for anyone in that age range with a steady job that keeps =
them busy.=20

The neighborhood is quickly becoming more expensive. There&#39;s a new mu=
ral every time I look outside. It&#39;s a close knit community here, a st=
eady mix of New Yorkers born and raised, and new New Yorkers.

You would have two huge windows, and a gas heater built-in. The light in =
the both the room and the apartment is beautiful, with afternoon sun draw=
ing it&#39;s way across the walls. There&#39;s a J line that runs outside=
 the window, which is a truly unique experience in 2014 New York. The apa=
rtment is on the 3rd floor and we have direct stairwell access to the roo=
f, a space in and of its own with multitudes of potential.=20

Regarding pets; we have 2 time-share dogs who both vary in duration of st=
ay. They are two ladies, Agnes and Cassidy, and are both incredibly sweet=
 and kind natured.=20

*Longer term requires deposit.

$1,800.00 Per Month, Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, Spacious 1bd in 2bd apt close=
 to Manhattan and Prospect Park
Available: Feb 03, 2015 through Jun 30, 2015

Looking for a young professional to sublet my beautiful bedroom out to un=
til July or before, we are flexible.  You&#39;d be sharing the apartment =
with a great, respectful and communicative guy.

The apartment has a lot of space and light.  It is a floor through apartm=
ent in a third floor walkup.  The bedrooms face backyards so are incredib=
ly quiet.  The nearest subway stop is Atlantic-Barclays which has so many=
 subway routes into Manhattan I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll have a good commute=
 to work and home -- so important to have many options when a train goes =
down for maintenance or &quot;signal problems&quot;.=20

Note: The furniture in the photos is different from the current setup

I&#39;ve loved living in this apartment.  I&#39;m currently spending a lo=
t of time upstate with my partner and kid so I&#39;m looking to sublet th=
is into the summer.  It&#39;s too nice to let go of.

We can all grab a bite/drink to figure out a good respectful match.=20

$1,400.00 Per Month, Financial District, Manhattan, Large Flex Room in Hi=
gh Rise
Available: Feb 14, 2015 through Jul 01, 2015

The Room:

The available space is a flex room separated off from the living room. Th=
e living room is rather large so, even with the division, there is still =
a traditional living room space. The room is large and has 10 ft ceilings=
, its own A/C and heating unit, and easily fits a full/queen-sized bed an=
d has room for a desk or other things you might have. The floor-to-ceilin=
g windows offer plenty of light and a pretty awesome view to wake up to. =
What&#39;s great is that we separated the room with a large closet wall. =
It&#39;s the equivalent of three closets, so you&#39;d have more than eno=
ugh space for your clothes. The downside is that it is not a full wall. A=
lthough the closet wall is huge, you&#39;d have to close it off further i=
f you wanted to make it more secluded since there is no door. The last tw=
o roommates didn&#39;t really mind it, but there are plenty of creative w=
ays to seal it off which would be up to your discretion.=20

The Building:

It is a doorman building with a gym, yoga studio, concierge, billiards ro=
om, club room, indoor pool, in-building laundry, several patios, and a 53=
rd story roof deck with beautiful views of the city. The building is foot=
steps from Seaport and Stone Street, offering plenty of great food and dr=
inking options. When you want to get away, the building is near both the =
Fulton Street and Wall Street stations, offering access to the A,C,E,1,2,=
3,4,5,6,J,Z,R, and the Path.  Times Square and Grand Central is about 15 =
minutes away.=20

The Roommate (me):

I&#39;m a 29-year-old lawyer (former teacher) and work nearby in the Fina=
ncial District. I work typical business hours, though I often come home l=
ate. I&#39;m respectful, dependable, communicative, clean, and generally =
quiet. I&#39;m definitely past my college years, but I&#39;m also not a h=
ermit. I enjoy legal things, coffee, movies, reading, sarcasm, Netflix ni=
ghts, politics, bars over clubs, and traveling.=20

You:

I&#39;m looking for a dependable, stable, mature, and respectful roommate=
. Someone who is tidy and knows how to share an apartment. It&#39;s easy =
to list off adjectives, but I basically want to live with someone that I =
can get along with or hang out with. I&#39;m not looking for a best frien=
d, but I also don&#39;t want to live with a stranger. A big part of this =
search is to see if we&#39;d be a good fit.  I have no hangups regarding =
potential roommates (sex/orientation/race/politics, etc.) as that&#39;s w=
here the respectful part comes in. (Though if you&#39;re a Republican kno=
w that I&#39;m a progressive vegetarian, so my mere existence might frigh=
ten you.)=20

The Deets:

The lease runs through July 1st, 2015 with an option to renew, and is ren=
t stabilized. I&#39;m hoping for someone long term, to finish the lease w=
ith (though I will probably renew anyway). I&#39;m looking for: first mon=
th (February/prorated), one thousand for security, and $400 for the wall =
closet (it cost more than 1k to get). So, $2125 to move in. There is also=
 a possibility of a March 1 move (let me know if that&#39;s what you&#39;=
re interested in).

If you are interested, please email me with some details about you (e.g.,=
 profession, personality, random thoughts, haikus, presidential race pred=
ictions). A social media link would also be great so I know you aren&#39;=
t a computer. Feel free to ask me any questions as well. I&#39;m hoping t=
o meet and show the place throughout the week/weekend.

Thanks for reading and good luck hunting. Everyone deserves a medal for s=
uccessfully finding a place in NYC.

this weekend!=20

About us:
Four women in our late-twenties, early 30s live here (just moved from Bro=
oklyn). Enjoy the space, the quiet, the convenience (only 30mins to midto=
wn, compared to my 45min Brooklyn commute). We are queer women - a barber=
, visual artists, writers, poets, and a dancer. One of us lives in the at=
tic with a private office. We have one cat and one small dog (in pic).=20=


We welcome one more member to our house to live and/or work. No couples. =
Small pets can be negotiated.

Don&#39;t hesitate to ask questions. I will respond to every inquiry!

$2,250.00 Per Month, East Village/Alphabet City, New York, Sunny 1 BD in =

$425.00 Per Week, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, 600 sq. ft., Cozy apartment on th=
e outskirts of Greenpoint, perfect for singles or couples, 2-week sublet
Available: Feb 17, 2015 through Mar 03, 2015

Our lovely Greenpoint railroad apartment is available for 2-week sublet f=
rom February 17th-March 3rd. It is a nice, fairly spacious railroad apart=
ment on the second floor of a two-story, four unit building. It is on Van=
 Dam St, on the far east end of Greenpoint. My girlfriend just started wo=
rking a post-doc job in North Carolina during the school year, and I&#39;=
m a touring musician, so our apartment will likely be available again thr=
oughout the spring, and we&#39;d potentially be open to a longer term sub=
let as well, depending on the situation.

The apartment was renovated about 5 years ago. It is nice and clean, ever=
ything works. It is an ideal setup for a single or couple, with a decent =
sized bedroom (roughly 14&#39;x9&#39;), two small middle rooms (10&#39;x8=
.5&#39; and 11&#39;x8.5&#39;) that can be used for office or storage or a=
n additional bedroom, nice cozy living room (12&#39;x12&#39;) and good si=
zed kitchen by NYC standards, with full bathroom off the kitchen.

Bedroom overlooks the street and the BQE with (sometimes epic) sunrise vi=
ews. It has a full sized bed, closet space and drawers you can use.=20

The apartment is musician-friendly for acoustic instrument practice (not =
suitable for drums or ensemble rehearsals), as I use one of the rooms as =
my music practice studio. There is a full 88-key piano keyboard you can p=
lay with headphones or quiet amp if you have one. I practice trumpet here=
 daily without issue (I just keep it within reasonable hours).=20

The other middle room was my girlfriend&#39;s office, but is currently mo=
stly empty. It could become an extra bedroom for a roommate situation, an=
d we do have very comfortable queen-sized full-height Aerobed that can be=
 inflated in this room if you need extra sleep space.=20

Living room gets great afternoon light. It has a small couch and coffee t=
able (which we use for eating as there is no dining table), as well as a =
comfy chair, nice stereo system, CD and record player, and you are welcom=
e to peruse my big CD and small record collection. There is also an input=
 cable for iPod or phone/streaming listening. There is an old dinosaur of=
 a TV which we only use for DVD watching, as we do not have cable(!!). Th=
ere is WiFi in the apartment for all your streaming needs. Kitchen is ful=
ly stocked and has gas stove/oven (but beware we do not own a microwave).=
=20

We are on the edge of an industrial zone and near the BQE, so there is so=
me noise from truck traffic during the daytime, but aside from that, it i=
s a very quiet block. The other tenants in the building are very friendly=
 but we rarely see them.

The location is a bit out of the way. The two closest subway stops are ea=
ch about a 15 minute walk (or 5 minutes by bike or bus). That being said,=
 there are a few good necessary amenities within a few blocks, and beyond=
 that, all the endless great things that Greenpoint and Williamsburg have=
 to offer are still very much within walking distance. Its a great place =
if you like to bike (and aren&#39;t afraid to ride it in cold weather) as=
 all of Greenpoint, Williamsburg, Bushwick, Long Island City and Sunnysid=
e are easily accessible in a matter of minutes by bike, and downtown Manh=
attan is only 20-30 minutes by bike. Its also a great location if you hav=
e a car, as you can hop right on the BQE, and street parking is rarely di=
fficult to find. There are even a few spots around the corner that have n=
o parking restrictions! 3 blocks away are a corner store with good craft =
beer offerings and sundry items, a liquor store, a laundromat, and Greenp=
oint Heights, a great neighborhood bar with craft beers on tap and a smal=
l but surprisingly good food menu that serves late.  A few blocks beyond =
that are a full service grocery store, a pie shop, a popular Korean fusio=
n restaurant, a good coffee bar, several more corner stores, Polish delis=
, and a hipstery deli/bodega, a legendary neighborhood dive bar, and the =
beautiful McGolrick Park which hosts a small but great farmers market on =
Sundays. A few more blocks and you&#39;re in the heart of Greenpoint, wit=
h an endless number of bars, restaurants, coffee houses, Polish butcher s=
hops and bakeries, and all kinds of shopping from discount to boutique. A=
lso close by is McCarren Park, with ball fields, a running track, and a S=
aturday farmers market. Williamsburg, in all its hip, gentrified glory, i=
s only a 20 minute walk.

Its a 15 minute walk to either the G train at Nassau Ave. or the L train =
at Graham, from which it is only 3 stops and under 10 minutes to Manhatta=
n. The B48 bus stops at the end of the block and will take you to the G t=
rain in 5 minutes, and the B24 stop is 2.5 blocks away and will take you =
to the L train in 5 minutes.

The neighborhood is one of the safest in Brooklyn.

We are asking $425/week, including utilities (heat, gas, electric and WiF=
i). This is a great deal for this neighborhood, well below market. If you=
 are interested, please feel free to message me for more info or with any=
 questions. Thanks for looking!

Call for entry or representation, $40.00 Fee, NY, New York, Baang + Burne=
 New Works Grant and Gallery Representation 2014-15
Available: Dec 01, 2014 through Mar 31, 2015

Dear Artists,

Welcome to Baang + Burne 2014-15 Call to Entry / New Works Grant.
Entry Deadline: 3/31/15

This is the third year Baang + Burne has hosted a Call for Entry / New Wo=
rks Grant. A spot on our gallery rosterrepresentation and/ or a $2,500 ca=
sh award that recognizes the strongest new works proposal in contemporary=
 art.

I know some of you must be wondering what is this all about, how is it di=
fferent from all the other call for entries out there and what is in it f=
or you.

Lets start with what is Baang + Burne.

Baang + Burne is founded in 2010 by artist Kesha Bruce and myself. I came=
 from 15 years of advertising and a career as a documentarian; Kesha has =
a solid track record as a fine art artist with an MFA from Hunter College=
. We wanted to do something different. We are romantic and idealistic in =
our belief of what art could be, the kind of advocates artists should hav=
e (creative, passionate, out-of-the-box-thinkers) and the type of dealers=
 collectors should do business with (ethical and honest). The combination=
 is tall order. So we created it ourselves.

Through 4 long years of exhibits, art fairs, auctions and collaborations,=
 Baang + Burne has evolved into what it is today  and it is still growing=
. We are somewhere between a traditional gallery and an artist collective=
. You are represented and spirit of collaboration is our core value. Art =
is a long game and we will only ever come out of this alive if we are in =
it together.

Joshua King, Dominic Sansone, Richard Hart and Nathan Sharratt are four w=
onderful artists we connected with and currently represent during our pre=
vious call for entry. Cat del Bueno was our first new works grant recipie=
nt.

Baang + Burne is growing and we are looking for you.

Everyone has limited resources and time. Those are put under further rest=
raints when you are an artist. We get it. If the fee is not within your b=
udget, then please, do not submit. If being a part of Baang + Burne excit=
es you, then we would love to see what youve been up to. If youve got a p=
roject underway and some money would help it along, click submit and put =
your name in the hat. We want to help you make new art.

We spent an enormous amount of time looking at what comes our way. Your s=
ubmissions are not taken lightly. This is a place of mutual respect. We r=
espect you for what you do and we ask you to extend us the same considera=
tion.

Baang + Burne is growing. We are looking for you. Join us.
