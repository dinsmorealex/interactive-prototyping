Hi--

Together, we beat SOPA in a huge victory for internet freedom.  But this =
Saturday, internet freedom protests are breaking out in over 200 cities =
across Europe.  Why? =20

Because the companies behind SOPA are using international trade agreements =
as a backdoor to pass SOPA-style laws

http://killacta.org

SOPA's supporters are pushing two agreements: ACTA and TPP1.  ACTA would =
criminalize users, encourage internet providers to spy on you, and make it =
easier for media companies to sue sites out of existence and jail their =
founders.  Sound familiar?  That's right, ACTA is from the same playbook =
as SOPA, but global.  Plus it didn't even have to pass through Congress2.

TPP goes even farther than ACTA, and the process has been even more =
secretive and corrupt.  Last weekend (we wish this was a joke) trade =
negotiators partied with MPAA (pro-SOPA) lobbyists before secret =
negotiations in a Hollywood hotel, while public interest groups were =
barred from meeting in the same building.3

Trade agreements are a gaping loophole, a secretive backdoor track =
that--even though it creates new laws--is miles removed from democracy.  =
Trade negotiators are unelected and unaccountable, so these agreements =
have been very hard for internet rights groups to stop.

But now the tide is turning.  Fueled by the movement to stop SOPA, =
anti-ACTA protests are breaking out across the EU, which hasn't ratified =
ACTA.  The protests are having an impact: leaders in Poland, the Czech =
Republic, and Slovakia have backtracked on ACTA.4  Now a massive round of =
street protests in over 200 cities is planned for this Saturday February =
11th.

We're planning an online protest this Saturday to support the protests in =
the streets.  Why?  Because together we can drive millions of emails to =
key decision makers--and start tipping the scales like we did on SOPA.

Can you take part?  Click here to get the code to run on your site!

http://killacta.org/#code

We just built an ACTA & TPP contact tool, and it's not just a petition.   =
It's code for your site that figures out the visitor's country and lets =
them email all their Members of European Parliament--the politicians who =
will be voting on ACTA in June--or the trade negotiators behind TPP.  This =
direct contact between voters and their officials, driven by websites of =
all sizes, was instrumental in the fight against SOPA. =20

We can use the same tactics to defeat ACTA & TPP, but we need your help!

Support the street protests with a flood of emails to the officials =
responsible for ACTA & TPP.  Get the code for your website!

http://killacta.org/#code

Don't have a website?  Tell officials in your country to scrap ACTA & TPP! =
  And spread the word about Saturday's protests!=20

http://killacta.org

This is going to be tough fight.  But we need to make secretive trade =
agreements harder to pass than US law.  If we don't, our internet's future =
belongs to the lobbyists behind SOPA.    =20

This is just the beginning,

--Holmes Wilson, Tiffiniy Cheng, Joshua Blount & the whole Fight for the =
Future team.

P.S. This map of ACTA street protests in Europe is amazing. The largest =
has almost 50,000 RSVP's!
