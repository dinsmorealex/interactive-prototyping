Hello List-
Here are listings as of 4/10/13
Listings Project Story of the Week

Hi Stephanie,

I thought I'd share with you how the LP has improved my life in NY. In 2011=
 I was
looking at the "opportunities" and saw a post about a Photography Salon whe=
re artists
met monthly to view and discuss each other's work. At my first salon, I met=
 a woman
who not only ended up becoming a good friend, but who introduced me to peop=
le who
would eventually make up my film crew, which also led me to a film club I n=
ow actively
participate in. Most importantly, through the Salon I formed many lasting, =
creative
friendships and found a creative community that has made me feel at home in=
 this
 big city. (Oh, and I also met you! Quite thankful for that, too.)

xo

$236 per month, Greenpoint, 225 sq ft, An art studio share in one of spacio=

Art Collective Studio Spaces
Available: April 15 through on going
I am looking for an artist to share my art studio space at Fowler Art  Coll=
ective.
 The attached photo is part an image of the space; total  space is 225 sq f=
t, and
of that 1/2 the space will be completely cleared  by 4/15.  Share begins 4/=
15, and
monthly rent is due on the 15th of  every month.
Amenities include lockers for keeping storage, hangout area with couch,  fr=
idge,
 water dispenser, Wifi, 24 hour access, clean bathrooms, great  artists wor=
king=20
around you.
If interested, please call/email me, and tell me a bit about yourself.
Thank you, and below is the text from the Fowler Arts Collective website.
Fowler Arts Collective is a studio and gallery collective located in the  G=
reenpoint
Terminal warehouse complex located on the East River  waterfront in Greenpo=
int,=20
Brooklyn. Established by Lia Post (aka  Cecelia) in the summer of 2010, Fow=
ler houses
24 talented artists  working in 18 studios. Fowler has a 900 square foot ga=
llery/project
 space that is the site for original exhibitions, artist projects,  reading=
s, classes,
and more. We are located on the second floor of the  Greenpoint Terminal bu=
ilding
at 67 West Street, Brooklyn, NY, 11222.
The gallery program at Fowler concentrates on exhibiting collaborative,  se=
lf-directed
shows between artists. Artists initially propose an  exhibition for the pro=
ject=20
space, and once the proposal has been  accepted, Fowler's director does not=
 impose
any outside curation. The  gallery space at at Fowler represents an equal c=
ollaboration
between  artists and the uniquely raw gallery space itself. In order to ben=
efit=20
 as many artists as possible, our gallery program is focused primarily on  =
exhibiting
emerging artists who do not have studios in our space. We  are accepting pr=
oposals
for our 2013 gallery programming. Contact us  here to learn more about prop=
osing
 an exhibition.
Fowler offers affordable working space to artists who are open to a  collab=
orative
environment. All of the studios are semi-private, meaning  that they do not=
 have
 doors and most walls are built to stop two feet  below the 9-foot tall cei=
lings.
Semi-private spaces encourage a  communal, collaborative atmosphere between=
 artists.
Facilities in the  space are shared by all artists with studios and they in=
clude
 a hang out  area, a small woodshop, and the gallery. Artists who have stud=
ios at
 Fowler are able to participate in annual Open Studios events and in  group=
 exhibitions
in the gallery.

$500 per month, Bushwick, 1500 sq ft, High-ceiling, bright, convenient, stu=
dio,=20
great for photographers, videographers.
Available: April 15th
I'm looking for nice artists to share in a 1500 square-foot art / photo  st=
udio=20
in Bushwick a couple blocks from the Morgan L. It has lots of  natural ligh=
t, and
roof access. Each artist will have an area to use,  but can also use the wh=
ole space
if needed.
I've set up a seamless background area for greenscreen video production  an=
d photography.
The idea is that we can pool our resources if you're up  for it.
Important: The space is undivided, meaning that you're able to use the  ent=
ire space
if you want -- there is a web calendar to schedule times  when you'll need =
the main
space, or want alone time. Otherwise, everyone  can work simultaneously. It=
's been
set up this way in the past, and has  worked quite well. I'm not against th=
e idea
of investing in partitions.
Hightlights
--A couple blocks from the Morgan L
--Skylight
--Good electric lights on ceiling w/ dimmers, including some track lighting=
 in the
center.
--A few blocks from the more developed Bushwick area so you can go chill  o=
ut after
a productive day at Alaska, or go get a sandwich at the  24-hour delis.
--You can be as loud as you want!
$500 per month, plus utilities (higher in the winter, but otherwise is  aro=
und $9
for electricity), with at least a three-month commitment. A  one-month depo=
sit is
also required - but if you don't have it at the  moment, we can work someth=
ing out.
Let me know if you're interested in  coming by and checking it out. Early w=
eeknights
are good for this.
Write with questions and for more photos. Thanks for reading!

$1250 per month, Williamsburg, 1500 sqft (I think?), Beautiful space, looki=
ng for
a roomie ASAP
Available: 4/1/2013 through 3/31/2014
I just moved into a beautiful 3-bedroom duplex five blocks from the  Lorime=
r/Metropolitan
Ave stop on the L train, and am still looking to  find one roommate. I'd li=
ke to
 keep one of the other rooms as a  study/guest room.
Seriously, this place is phenomenal. Two floors, lots of room, storage  spa=
ce, 1.5
bathrooms, three rooms that can each fit a bed and desk, bike  storage, a g=
iant=20
shared patio, and what the old tenants say is a  fantastic management compa=
ny. I
 couldn't believe it either.
I'm 27, male, and I do film for a living which means I'm often traveling  a=
nd working
from home less than half the time. I like to be social and  would want to u=
se this
awesome space to host some events and parties,  but for the most part I spe=
nd most
of my time out of the house and you  won't see me for days at a time. I've =
been=20
pretty into meditating and it  would be awesome if you are too! I'm gay and=
 I tend
to have male  roommates more often, but I don't care what gender or sexuali=
ty or
 race  or anything you are. I love dogs and cats but am unfortunately aller=
gic.=20
 I'll be traveling a few months per year, during which time I'll sublet  ou=
t my=20
room.
I'm looking for someone around age 24-32, with that perfect combination  of=
 young-at-heart
and easygoing with pays rent on time (I'll need to be  convinced somehow of=
 a source
of income.) Not too messy, but I'm not a  neat freak unless people are comi=
ng over.
I tend to get along best with  people in artistic, technology, or scientifi=
c fields,
but as long as  you're not a banker we should get along fine. You'd cosign =
the lease
 with me and would share the deposit and initial furniture costs. And  then=
 we'd
 have a sweet apartment together!

THE APARTMENT: A 2 bedroom 1 bath apartment in FORT GREENE BROOKLYN, 950  s=
quare
 feet. It's the entire third floor of a brownstone; has beautiful  hardwood=
 floors,
nine foot ceilings, lots of gorgeous natural light,  and all the original c=
harming
touches of an authentic pre-war  brownstone. The bathroom is huge (a rarity=
 for=20
New York) with a full  tub. The kitchen isn't huge but I rarely use it so i=
f you're
someone who  like to cook, it's all yours!

YOUR ROOM: It's a FULL bedroom (not a converted office or a bathroom  with =
an air
mattress in it) that can fit any size bed with amble space  for a dresser, =
desk,
 and more. It has good closet space, two large  windows (my rooms only has =
one window.
. ..you bastard) with the  original shutters, and other beautiful Victorian=
 brownstone
touches.

LOCATION: Everything listed above is truly just cake. The best thing  about=
 the=20
apartment is its location. You're just one block south of Fort  Greene Park=
! Also.
. .this is not an apartment where you're dependent  on one tempermental tra=
in (*cough*The
L*cough*). If you live in THIS  apartment then you are literally within a c=
ouple
 of blocks (see map) of  the A/C AND G trains AND a six minute walk from At=
lantic
Terminal where  you have access to the B, Q, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, D, N, R, (so ma=
ny choices!).
 It's 10 minutes to Wall Street and less than 30 minutes to Union  Square. =
ALSO,
 if you have a car, there's street parking as well.

Dg&ved=3D0CDEQ8gEwAA
NEIGHBORHOOD: Fort Greene is gorgeous and, most importantly, very safe.  It=
 was=20
recently named by TheLMagazine.com as Brooklyn's best  neighborhood and it =
truly
 is. The apartment is located on a quiet, tree  lined, residential street (=
filed
 with a mix young people and families  with gaybies), and cross streets on =
either
side have everything you  could want. Grocery stores, pharmacies, convenien=
ce stores,
laundry mat,  bars (General Greene, Bonita, Brooklyn Public House, Aliby an=
d many
 more), restaurants GALORE: sushi (SushiD), Chinese, Diner, Italian  (Mario=
's Pizzeria),
Middle Eastern (Black Iris), Indian, Mexican (Habana  Outpost, Pequena), Gr=
eek (Olea),
French (Chez Oscar), African (Madiba).  If you're a sports/music fan, you a=
re with
in walking distance to the  brand new Barclay Center (http://www.barclaysce=
nter.com/).
OR, if you're  an artsy fartsy person (like me), you are within walking dis=
tance
 to  the Brooklyn Academy of Music (http://www.bam.org/).
ALSO. . .ya know the Brooklyn Flea Market  (http://www.brooklynflea.com/)? =
Well=20
this apartment is literally right  WHERE the Brooklyn Flea Market is. Like.=
 . .you
literally wake up on  Saturday morning. . .walk out your front door. . .tur=
n right.
. ..and  it's directly in front you (April thru November). Making this loca=
tion=20
 perfect for hoarders and compulsive shoppers (who?).

ME: I'm a twenty-something year old gay male. But nice gay  (http://www.bud=
dytv.com/articles/How-I-Met-Your-Mother/Images/neil-patrick-harris-4.jpg),
 not scary gay  (http://earsucker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/perez-hilt=
on-stops-bullying.jpg).
 A graduate of Sarah Lawrence College, I'm a theater  director/actor/writer=
/filmmaker
who primarily working in film  distribution and sometimes works from home. =
Most=20
of my friends are in  the arts/media in one-way or the other.
On a day-to-day basis I'm a low key person. But I'm young and social, so  t=
he apartment
will occasionally be young and social. There won't be  hoards of people han=
ging=20
out in the living room every day or parties  every weekend (I'd probably on=
ly throw
something that would constitute a  real party once every 10 weeks. . ...may=
be. .
 ..and they tend to be on  the wholesome/kitchey side), but I like hanging =
out with
friends and  will occasionally have a couple people over.
YOU (MYSTERY ROOMMATE): I'm open to living with a guy or a girl or anything=
 in between
(no midgets).
YOU MUST TO BE: Clean/respectful of communal spaces (in terms of your  bedr=
oom.=20
. ..I don't care), financially responsible, and kind.
YOU CANNOT BE: Someone with a cat or a dog (ferrets encouraged), a  meth-he=
ad, a
 couple (yuk), an uptight shrew, a stickler for perfect  grammar, or someon=
e will
judge my food choices  (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DGxqycijBUn0&featur=
e=3Drelated).
I  don't care about smoking, but the building manager does so if you are a =
 smoker
you'll have to take it outside.
I'D PREFER YOU TO BE: This woman..... http://asecretforest.typepad.com/.a/6=
a0133ec89b204970b0134876de409970c-800wi
THE MOST EXCITING THING ABOUT THIS APARTMENT: The most exciting thing  abou=
t this
apartment in that I'm currently in the process (about 70%  done) of decorat=
ing it
using GAY MAGIC. Let me explain...you know how on  cable TV they often show=
case=20
things/spaces/people in distress (i.e. an  ugly apartment, a house filled b=
y a hoarder,
an ugly bride) and then a  gay person comes in and makes it all better? Tha=
t would
be called gay  magic and I'm currently using it to decorate this apartment =
(NOTABLE
GAY  MAGICIANS: Nate Berkus, that really shiny guy on Say Yes to the Dress,=
  Dumbledore,
ME). So you won't have to worry about anything ALTHOUGH if  you have things=
/are=20
wanting to contribute (i.e. kitchen stuff,  whatever), you're more than wel=
come=20
to!
WHEN: This room would be yours starting May 1st.
BUSINESS: Your rent would be $1,425 a month plus half of all utilities  (ut=
ilities
=3D electricity, heat, hot water, gas, WIFI). My lease is  through mid Sept=
ember 2013
(I'll renew it) but I'll consider any  roommate as long as they can commit =
to at
 least three months. I would  need one months rent as a security deposit up=
 front
AND if you're not  someone who I know (personally, spiritually, biblically)=
 very
 well, I  will be needing some personal/financial references, but we'll cro=
ss that
 bridge when we come to it. ALSO...there's a slight chance there might  be =
small
 rent bump when I renew the lease in September, but it's usually  not a ver=
y large
increase.
THE NEXT STEP: If you're interested (or have further questions), please  em=
ail me
some basic information about yourself  (name/age/gender/occupation). I'll r=
espond
and we'll set up a time for  you to see the apartment in person / interview=
 and=20
then go from there!
Thanks so much and hope to hear from you soon!
Sincerely

Hoboken, Work for to Pay your Rent: Handy Crew member needed aboard histori=
c ferryboat
Available: ASAP
Bunk available in crew quarters aboard historic ship in exchange for 25 hou=
rs of
 work p/wk.
Ahoy!
We're looking for a hands-on, responsible, and eager addition to our  crew =
of 4=20
(13 if you count the animals.). Yankee Ferry is an historic  ferryboat, 106=
 years
old, now privately-owned and maintained. We're  docked (permanently, we don=
't go
 out at sea) right on the Hudson River  in Hoboken, NJ, with all of Manhatt=
an as
 our vista.
Yankee is an old girl, so she requires lots of care, and in return she  pro=
vides
 us one of the richest experiences of our lives. A ship this  size (~150' f=
rom bow
to stern), made of wood and steel, and entirely  subject to the elements, i=
s always
needing, sometimes crucial, work and  attention. In addition to keeping Yan=
kee floating
and sparkling, we also  spend our blood and sweat (no tears) hosting incred=
ible=20
private and  public events of all kinds and sizes, continuing Yankee's dili=
gent=20
 service to the world.
We're looking for the right pair of fresh hands to join the adventure. Mand=
atory
 requirements of our new crew member are:
1) Must be handy - the more carpentry, repair work, electric, plumbing,  we=
lding,
etc. that you know, the better. You don't need to be an expert,  but you mu=
st at
 least be familiar with working with tools and have the  sensitivity and ge=
neral
 wherewithal of how things work and how to fix  them. Boat experience is ob=
viously
a plus, but not necessary. Any other  skills or talents are all pluses too.
2) Must be reliable and trustworthy -
We are all required to uphold our own integrity as part of this small  comm=
unity.
The requirement of this position is 25 hours of concentrated  and devoted w=
ork per
week. We must all know that we can count on each  other.
3) Respectful - to each other, to the rules, and most importantly to  Yanke=
e herself.
This isn't just a thrilling experience to tell our  friends about. This is =
being
 a part of something really special, so we  all must honor that, and respec=
t it.
4) Must be hungry - hungry to grow, hungry to create, contribute, and to  l=
earn.
 Again this is a fantastic endeavor, and it's only right that the  people w=
ho are
a part of it want to thrive in it.
So if you think you're up for the adventure, tell me. Who are you, what  ar=
e you
 good at, and what do you think of this opportunity?
I look forward to hearing from you.

Ahoy!
We're looking for a responsible, and eager  marketing/business/bookkeeping/=

costs to stay afloat are high, and there is no multimillionaire  benefactor=

 paying the bills for us. Through a myriad of events,  photo/film shoots, o=
ur stay-aboard
program, and various other ways,  Yankee earns her own income. We're lookin=
g for
 someone to charge the  business side of things. An ideas person, as well a=
s a get-it-done
 person. Someone that can think creatively about new directions, make it  a=
ll work,
and make it continually more productive and efficient. Someone  to crunch t=
he numbers
and keep impeccable records. Must also be tech  savvy.
*Must be reliable and trustworthy -

$1275 per month, Red Hook, 225 sq. ft, Bedroom and Office / Studio in a cat=
ch
Available: June 1 through January 15
This is a wonderful apartment. It is very bright, quiet, well-lighted,  and=
 everything
works beautifully. One very clean tiled bathroom, three  rooms, and a good-=
sized
 kitchen and living room space. A video buzzer.  Lots of nice windows. Wate=
r pressure.
Excellent views including various  water, with Jersey ferry, and the Statue=
 of Liberty
(visible in entirety  when viewed-which it can be-from the abnormally deep =
bathtub).
2 blocks from Fairway supermarket, best of the best.
The available bedroom is 150 square feet with a spacious closet and two  la=
rge windows;
its adjoining office / studio, 75 square feet.
My beloved housemate is moving on from NYC, and I would like to split  this=
 apartment
with one other person. The two rooms available are on  their own end of the=
 place,
side by side. The kitchen and bathroom  separate the two bedrooms on either=
 end=20
of the apartment. There is  privacy.
I am a considerate, calm, organized, friendly, clean, sane, feminist,  arts=
- and
 politics-minded 27-year-old dude with my shit together. I work  in publish=
ing and
will be dividing my time between Ugly Duckling  Presse, where I am one of t=
he editors,
Zone Books, Triple Canopy, and  Artforum.
I think the back half of the apartment is best suited for a writer,  design=
er, or
artist with a practice that does not take up a great amount  of space.
Being clean is essential, as in, I need to live with someone able to  consi=
stently
share all the responsibilities. That said, I enjoy sharing  and using space=
. I cook
regularly. Dinner parties, occasional couch  guests, all ok with me given a=
 little
warning. The dog in the picture is  sadly not a resident. I'm afraid the co=
atrack
isn't either, if that  happens to be a selling point.
This is an allied space for people of all identities.
Come check it out.

$900 per month, Red Hook, aprox. 900 sq. foot apt..., Great Red Hook Apartm=
ent
Available: Flexible though prefer May 1st through Flexible
Dear Friends,
Thank goodness it's spring!!!  I am on the hunt for a  temporary/permanent =
roommate
to share a great apartment in Red Hook,  Brooklyn.
A Bit About Me:
My name is Jamie and I am a 36 year old male who has lived in New York  now=
 for=20
11 years this past  April.  A year (or so) ago December, I  graduated Hunte=
r College
with a Bachelor's degree in sociology and a  minor in mathematics.  I curre=
ntly=20
tend bar in the Carroll Gardens/Red  Hook area at a place called B61--which=
 is underneath
a restaurant named  Alma  I have just applied for a masters program in educ=
ation
 and am also  pursuing the idea of opening my own bar.
The Apartment:
The apartment is approximately 900 sq. feet and has two nice size  bedrooms=
, each
with a big closet. It has a newly renovated large kitchen  that I must say =
is rather
incredible. There is a good area for dining  that is connected to both the =
kitchen
and the living room area. There is  one bathroom that is a decent size.  Th=
e apartment
is in Red Hook,  Brooklyn, on Dikeman Street, between Dwight and Richards. =
It is
 a quiet  street that has a very old school neighborhood feel.  Ah yes, the=
re is
  also a big back yard that is in the process of being landscaped again,  p=
ost Sandy.
Specifics:
Rent: $900 + bills (around $80)
Where: 38 Dikeman Street, Brooklyn
When: May 1st (could be flexible)
An Important Note:  as mentioned before, I am looking for a  temporary/perm=
anent
 roommate.  The reason for this statement is that  there is some ongoing dr=
ama between
the two owners of my building.   There is a very slight possibility that th=
e apartment
will need to be  vacated within 4-6 months, hence the temporary portion of =
statement.
  There is a higher probability that absolutely nothing will happen as a  r=
esult
 of the owner drama in which I would be open to having a longer  term roomm=
ate.....
Honestly, this is a fantastic apartment in an up and coming  neighborhood; =
so if
 you are looking for a room for rent, you have found a  good one. Drop me a=
n e mail
with a little information about yourself  and I will promptly respond.
I look forward to meeting you
Jamie

with a double bed, a dresser, a night stand and a large  closet. The apartm=
ent has
a full kitchen, full bath, closets, etc. It is  quiet with nice light. The =

There
 is laundry in  the building and wireless internet access in apartment. And=
 it's
 very  close to some of the best restaurants and bars in Harlem.
I hold the lease. I reside in another city for the majority of the time  an=

lves,
 a dresser). I am a 44 year old white male married  designer. Utilities are=

This situation is available now. Ideally I am looking for someone who  will=
 want
 it through at least the end of Sept. 2013. There is the very  strong possi=
bility
of this situation continuing after Sept. Because I am  out of town a lot an=
d its
 a hurry-up situation I am going to want some  references and first month's=
 rent,
last month's rent and deposit upon  the making of the agreement.

Hi there, I am a serious working local Brooklyn composer/ singer/  artist/ =
arts=20
nonprofit director who is offering the downstairs attached  studio apartmen=
t of=20
my live/ work duplex to another creative artist, or  just another adult of =
NYC's
 counter culture.
This sizable, and clean apartment for rent has it's own private street  ent=
erance,
and it's own full kitchen, and full bath.  It's 3 blocks from  both Graham =
ave,=20
and Grand Ave L station, laundry, and 10-15 minutes  from manhattan, door t=
o door.
  It's a very quiet street, in a very  desirable neighborhood.
There is nothing like this anymore for the price and value left in  William=
sburg,
and I want to  offer it to the right person, who could  really benefit from=
 their
own affordable space in this now highly priced  area.
No pics or street name here, to keep this property off of the grid from wil=
liambsburg
real estate developers.
I record and rehearse frequently with acoustic instruments, voice,  piano, =
synthesizers
chamber music, and some light percussion in my  upstairs apartment, but not=
 loud
 full band rehearsals or rock music that  will keep you up very late at nig=
ht, as
I am a respectful neighbor.
I only ask that whomever moves in, understands and respects this  situation=
 fully,
and also allows me to be able to record, and also does  not interrupt my li=
ve recordings
with often blasting music, loud art  fabrication (metal drilling, power saw=
s) and
loud parties, etc.
I am only getting this pricing deal because I have been an artist in the  n=
eighborhood
for over 10 years, and have a long relationship with the  landlord.
Utilities and Hot Water Not included, however we are able to split an inter=
net/=20
tv bill 2 ways.
Please email me to tell me just a small bit about yourself, and to set up a=
 viewing,
and meeting.
Thanks very much, and best of luck to you in NYC!

$836 per month, Bushwick, Large Live/Work space near the Jefferson L
Available: 5/1
This place is ideal for anyone involved in visual arts. The place was a  dr=
ess factory
that has been converted to a live/work space. The bedrooms  are already bui=
lt out
with loft beds and such. The front room (about  40' x 30') is a massive sha=
red studio
space, in which you can have an  area to create whatever you need to create=
. The
 bedroom is down the hall  toward the back and is 12' x 12' x 11' with a lo=
ft structure
included.  Two large windows face the West, outside is an open yard, the sk=
y, and
 great sunlight during the afternoon.
Our fantastic Norwegian neighbors let us use their yard whenever for  cooko=
uts,=20
firepits, etc. (the space has a fire door on the side leading  to the yard)=
. The
 space also has a huge flattop roof which can be used  for any number of th=
ings,
 but hasn't been developed as of yet. There are  plans afoot to have the sp=
ace listed
in Bushwick Open Studios, so if  you have works you need to show you'll hav=
e the
 opportunity to exhibit  them.
There are four roommates, all good folk and all heavily involved in the  ar=
ts both
professionally and privately. Utilities are around $50 a month  and we woul=
d need
a one-month security deposit
Obviously we are looking for someone who can steadily handle the cost of  t=
he space.
Send me an email telling me about yourself and if you sound  like a good fi=
t, I'll
respond and we can meet up for a showing and you  can meet the roomies. Two=
 blocks

I am a female artist/sculptor looking for a room or shared living space.   =
I'm currently
subletting in Red Hook after losing my live/work studio  and need to find a=
 living
space by May 1st.
I work in a gilding studio (also in Red Hook) and do my own sculpture,
most recently I had a residency at Museum of Arts and Design so I am
looking forward to being able to continue the work I started in the
program. I need a pet friendly home: I have older cats, extremely sweet and=
 charming.
  I am considerate, funny, hard working.

$1100 per month, Brooklyn, Gardener / Filmmaker / Positive Guy Seeks Room
Available: ASAP through LONG TERM
My name is Ryan and I am 24-year-old male looking for a new place to  call =
home=20
in New York. I was recently subletting a room in Park Slope  and my time is=
 up!=20
I have good credit, proof of solid income, etc...  I  am looking to live in=
 Ditmas
Park, Park Slope, Carroll Gardens,  Greenpoint, Clinton Hill, Bed-Stuy, Cob=
ble Hill,
Brooklyn Heights or  Fort Greene. Although I'm open to just about anything =
if it
 fits me.
I am a positive, considerate person, a cinematographer and filmmaker,  reco=
rd collector,
avid cyclist, gardener, composter, homebrewer,  environmentally conscious g=
uy looking
for a new place to live. I have  lived in large community settings with fam=
ilies
 as well as smaller  situations.
I am a southerner, originally from Kentucky, and I'm looking for a real,  r=
elaxing,
home environment. Someplace that is comfortable and doesn't  feel like an a=
partment.
Open spaces, maybe a front porch, a yard, a  place to drink iced tea on a h=
ot afternoon.
Am I dreaming?
I kind of fell in love with the whole urban homesteading movement as of  la=
te. I
 grew up gardening and I'd love to keep doing so. My last house  had chicke=
ns in
 the front yard. If your place has a backyard or  frontyard that I can pote=
ntially
garden and/or have chickens in that is a  HUGE PLUS, but not a dealbreaker.
I have a car (makes bringing home groceries much easier!) I am also a membe=
r of=20
the Park Slope Food Co-op.
I love all kinds of music and I'm willing to share what I have to listen  t=
o. I=20
have a somewhat large record collection that always seems to be  growing. B=
y large
I mean, 250+ albums.
I am an avid hiker/backpacker and love trying to summit very tall mountains=
 (and
 shorter ones).
My budget is a maximum of 1200.00 per month although I'm looking to pay  le=
ss so
 I can continue to work freelance on personal projects and low  budget inde=
pendent
films. That being said, if the place is right, I am  willing to work for it=
.
Please email me if you think I'd be a good fit in your place. We can  work =
out a
 time for me to come see the space. My schedule is fairly  flexible.
kindly,
Ryan
P.S. I have my uncle's HBOGO password...

k you, and below is the text from the Fowler Arts Collective website.<br />=
 <br /> Fowler Arts Collective is a studio and gallery collective located i=
n the  Greenpoint Terminal warehouse complex located on the East River  wat=
erfront in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Established by Lia Post (aka  Cecelia) in =
the summer of 2010, Fowler houses 24 talented artists  working in 18 studio=
s. Fowler has a 900 square foot gallery/project  space that is the site for=
 original exhibitions, artist projects,  readings, classes, and more. We ar=
e located on the second floor of the  Greenpoint Terminal building at 67 We=
st Street, Brooklyn, NY, 11222.<br /> <br /> The gallery program at Fowler =
concentrates on exhibiting collaborative,  self-directed shows between arti=
sts. Artists initially propose an  exhibition for the project space, and on=
ce the proposal has been  accepted, Fowler's director does not impose any o=
utside curation. The  gallery space at at Fowler represents an equal collab=
oration between  artists and the uniquely raw gallery space itself. In orde=
r to benefit  as many artists as possible, our gallery program is focused p=
rimarily on  exhibiting emerging artists who do not have studios in our spa=
ce. We  are accepting proposals for our 2013 gallery programming. Contact u=
s  here to learn more about proposing an exhibition.<br /> <br /> Fowler of=
fers affordable working space to artists who are open to a  collaborative e=
nvironment. All of the studios are semi-private, meaning  that they do not =
have doors and most walls are built to stop two feet  below the 9-foot tall=
 ceilings. Semi-private spaces encourage a  communal, collaborative atmosph=
ere between artists. Facilities in the  space are shared by all artists wit=
h studios and they include a hang out  area, a small woodshop, and the gall=
ery. Artists who have studios at  Fowler are able to participate in annual =
Open Studios events and in  group exhibitions in the gallery.<br /><br /> <=

 one just left so we have an  opening. The lease is on a month to month bas=

 places at the graham  and grand stop.  We are located in the ISCP building=
 and have access to  their shows.  <br /> <br /> There are rarely more then=
 two people in here at a time, so there is  always plenty of privacy and sp=
ace to work on bigger projects.  Each of  us have a 12' section of wall to =
hang our work and keep our work  stations.  The ideal studio mate will be f=
riendly and work well in a  creative environment with other artists around.=

0 per month, Bushwick, 1500 sq ft, High-ceiling, bright, convenient, studio=
, great for photographers, videographers.<br /> Available: April 15th<br />=
<br /> I'm looking for nice artists to share in a 1500 square-foot art / ph=
oto  studio in Bushwick a couple blocks from the Morgan L. It has lots of  =
natural light, and roof access. Each artist will have an area to use,  but =
can also use the whole space if needed. <br /> <br /> I've set up a seamles=
s background area for greenscreen video production  and photography. The id=
ea is that we can pool our resources if you're up  for it. <br /> <br /> Im=
portant: The space is undivided, meaning that you're able to use the  entir=
e space if you want -- there is a web calendar to schedule times  when you'=
ll need the main space, or want alone time. Otherwise, everyone  can work s=
imultaneously. It's been set up this way in the past, and has  worked quite=
 well. I'm not against the idea of investing in partitions.  <br /> <br /> =
Hightlights <br /> --A couple blocks from the Morgan L <br /> --Skylight<br=
 /> --Good electric lights on ceiling w/ dimmers, including some track ligh=
ting in the center. <br /> --A few blocks from the more developed Bushwick =
area so you can go chill  out after a productive day at Alaska, or go get a=
 sandwich at the  24-hour delis. <br /> --You can be as loud as you want!<b=
r /> <br /> $500 per month, plus utilities (higher in the winter, but other=
wise is  around $9 for electricity), with at least a three-month commitment=
. A  one-month deposit is also required - but if you don't have it at the  =
moment, we can work something out. Let me know if you're interested in  com=
ing by and checking it out. Early weeknights are good for this. <br /> <br =
/> Write with questions and for more photos. Thanks for reading!<br /><br /=

ost part I spend most of my time out of the house and you  won't see me for=
 days at a time. I've been pretty into meditating and it  would be awesome =
if you are too! I'm gay and I tend to have male  roommates more often, but =
I don't care what gender or sexuality or race  or anything you are. I love =
dogs and cats but am unfortunately allergic.  I'll be traveling a few month=

-at-heart and easygoing with pays rent on time (I'll need to be  convinced =
somehow of a source of income.) Not too messy, but I'm not a  neat freak un=
less people are coming over. I tend to get along best with  people in artis=
tic, technology, or scientific fields, but as long as  you're not a banker =
we should get along fine. You'd cosign the lease  with me and would share t=

25 per month, Fort Greene, 950 square feet, ROOMMATE WANTED from Brooklyn B=
rownstone Dream. MAY 1st move in!<br /> Available: May 1st, 2013<br /><br /=
> Hey there!<br /> So I'm currently searching for a roommate for my gorgeou=
s two bedroom  brownstone apartment to move in on MAY 1st. It's in FORT GRE=
ENE, and  real PRIME Fort Greene, not west Clinton Hill (like. . .ya know w=
here  the Brooklyn Flea Market is? RIGHT THERE). The room is $1,425 a month=
  (plus utilities), would require one months rent as an additional down  pa=
yment, and a minimum three months commitment. Please let me know ASAP  if y=
ou're interested as I'm wanting to start interviewing people this  weekend.=
 Below are some details / links / pictures about the apartment. <br /> Than=
ks!<br /> <br /> THE APARTMENT: A 2 bedroom 1 bath apartment in FORT GREENE=
 BROOKLYN, 950  square feet. It's the entire third floor of a brownstone; h=
as beautiful  hardwood floors, nine foot ceilings, lots of gorgeous natural=
 light,  and all the original charming touches of an authentic pre-war  bro=
wnstone. The bathroom is huge (a rarity for New York) with a full  tub. The=
 kitchen isn't huge but I rarely use it so if you're someone who  like to c=
ook, it's all yours!<br /> <br /> MORE PHOTOS: http://www.flickr.com/photos=
/55957258@N03/sets/72157632613627121/<br /> <br /> YOUR ROOM: It's a FULL b=
edroom (not a converted office or a bathroom  with an air mattress in it) t=
hat can fit any size bed with amble space  for a dresser, desk, and more. I=
t has good closet space, two large  windows (my rooms only has one window. =
. ..you bastard) with the  original shutters, and other beautiful Victorian=
 brownstone touches.<br /> <br /> MORE PHOTOS: http://www.flickr.com/photos=
/55957258@N03/sets/72157627667621015/<br /> <br /> LOCATION: Everything lis=
ted above is truly just cake. The best thing  about the apartment is its lo=
cation. You're just one block south of Fort  Greene Park! Also. . .this is =
not an apartment where you're dependent  on one tempermental train (*cough*=
The L*cough*). If you live in THIS  apartment then you are literally within=
 a couple of blocks (see map) of  the A/C AND G trains AND a six minute wal=
k from Atlantic Terminal where  you have access to the B, Q, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,=
 D, N, R, (so many choices!).  It's 10 minutes to Wall Street and less than=
 30 minutes to Union  Square. ALSO, if you have a car, there's street parki=
ng as well. <br /> <br /> https://maps.google.com/maps?q=3Dlafayette+ave+an=

&ei=3DKrgAUcLkMc630AHw9oGADg&ved=3D0CDEQ8gEwAA<br /> <br /> NEIGHBORHOOD: F=
ort Greene is gorgeous and, most importantly, very safe.  It was recently n=
amed by TheLMagazine.com as Brooklyn's best  neighborhood and it truly is. =
The apartment is located on a quiet, tree  lined, residential street (filed=
 with a mix young people and families  with gaybies), and cross streets on =
either side have everything you  could want. Grocery stores, pharmacies, co=
nvenience stores, laundry mat,  bars (General Greene, Bonita, Brooklyn Publ=
ic House, Aliby and many  more), restaurants GALORE: sushi (SushiD), Chines=
e, Diner, Italian  (Mario's Pizzeria), Middle Eastern (Black Iris), Indian,=
 Mexican (Habana  Outpost, Pequena), Greek (Olea), French (Chez Oscar), Afr=
ican (Madiba).  If you're a sports/music fan, you are with in walking dista=
nce to the  brand new Barclay Center (http://www.barclayscenter.com/). OR, =
if you're  an artsy fartsy person (like me), you are within walking distanc=
e to  the Brooklyn Academy of Music (http://www.bam.org/). <br /> <br /> AL=
SO. . .ya know the Brooklyn Flea Market  (http://www.brooklynflea.com/)? We=
ll this apartment is literally right  WHERE the Brooklyn Flea Market is. Li=
ke. . .you literally wake up on  Saturday morning. . .walk out your front d=
oor. . .turn right. . ..and  it's directly in front you (April thru Novembe=
r). Making this location  perfect for hoarders and compulsive shoppers (who=
?).<br /> <br /> MORE PHOTOS: http://www.flickr.com/photos/55957258@N03/set=
s/72157627791590578/<br /> <br /> ME: I'm a twenty-something year old gay m=
ale. But nice gay  (http://www.buddytv.com/articles/How-I-Met-Your-Mother/I=
mages/neil-patrick-harris-4.jpg),  not scary gay  (http://earsucker.com/wp-=
content/uploads/2010/10/perez-hilton-stops-bullying.jpg).  A graduate of Sa=
rah Lawrence College, I'm a theater  director/actor/writer/filmmaker who pr=
imarily working in film  distribution and sometimes works from home. Most o=
f my friends are in  the arts/media in one-way or the other. <br /> <br /> =
On a day-to-day basis I'm a low key person. But I'm young and social, so  t=
he apartment will occasionally be young and social. There won't be  hoards =
of people hanging out in the living room every day or parties  every weeken=
d (I'd probably only throw something that would constitute a  real party on=
ce every 10 weeks. . ...maybe. . ..and they tend to be on  the wholesome/ki=
tchey side), but I like hanging out with friends and  will occasionally hav=
e a couple people over. <br /> <br /> YOU (MYSTERY ROOMMATE): I'm open to l=
iving with a guy or a girl or anything in between (no midgets). <br /> <br =
/> YOU MUST TO BE: Clean/respectful of communal spaces (in terms of your  b=
edroom. . ..I don't care), financially responsible, and kind. <br /> <br />=
 YOU CANNOT BE: Someone with a cat or a dog (ferrets encouraged), a  meth-h=
ead, a couple (yuk), an uptight shrew, a stickler for perfect  grammar, or =
someone will judge my food choices  (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DGxqyc=
ijBUn0&feature=3Drelated). I  don't care about smoking, but the building ma=
nager does so if you are a  smoker you'll have to take it outside.<br /> I'=
D PREFER YOU TO BE: This woman..... http://asecretforest.typepad.com/.a/6a0=
133ec89b204970b0134876de409970c-800wi<br /> <br /> THE MOST EXCITING THING =
ABOUT THIS APARTMENT: The most exciting thing  about this apartment in that=
 I'm currently in the process (about 70%  done) of decorating it using GAY =
MAGIC. Let me explain...you know how on  cable TV they often showcase thing=
s/spaces/people in distress (i.e. an  ugly apartment, a house filled by a h=
oarder, an ugly bride) and then a  gay person comes in and makes it all bet=
ter? That would be called gay  magic and I'm currently using it to decorate=
 this apartment (NOTABLE GAY  MAGICIANS: Nate Berkus, that really shiny guy=
 on Say Yes to the Dress,  Dumbledore, ME). So you won't have to worry abou=
t anything ALTHOUGH if  you have things/are wanting to contribute (i.e. kit=
chen stuff,  whatever), you're more than welcome to!<br /> <br /> WHEN: Thi=
s room would be yours starting May 1st. <br /> <br /> BUSINESS: Your rent w=
ould be $1,425 a month plus half of all utilities  (utilities =3D electrici=
ty, heat, hot water, gas, WIFI). My lease is  through mid September 2013 (I=
'll renew it) but I'll consider any  roommate as long as they can commit to=
 at least three months. I would  need one months rent as a security deposit=
 up front AND if you're not  someone who I know (personally, spiritually, b=
iblically) very well, I  will be needing some personal/financial references=
, but we'll cross that  bridge when we come to it. ALSO...there's a slight =
chance there might  be small rent bump when I renew the lease in September,=
 but it's usually  not a very large increase.<br /> <br /> THE NEXT STEP: I=
f you're interested (or have further questions), please  email me some basi=
c information about yourself  (name/age/gender/occupation). I'll respond an=
d we'll set up a time for  you to see the apartment in person / interview a=
nd then go from there! <br /> Thanks so much and hope to hear from you soon=
! <br /> Sincerely<br /><br /> <a style=3D"color: black;" href=3D"http://r2=

 Yankee floating and sparkling, we also  spend our blood and sweat (no tear=

etter. You don't need to be an expert,  but you must at least be familiar w=

 how things work and how to fix  them. Boat experience is obviously a plus,=
 but not necessary. Any other  skills or talents are all pluses too.<br /> =
2) Must be reliable and trustworthy - <br /> We are all required to uphold =
our own integrity as part of this small  community. The requirement of this=
 position is 25 hours of concentrated  and devoted work per week. We must a=

a thrilling experience to tell our  friends about. This is being a part of =
something really special, so we  all must honor that, and respect it. <br /=

 learn. Again this is a fantastic endeavor, and it's only right that the  p=

<br /> Available: Flexible though prefer May 1st through Flexible<br /><br =
/> Dear Friends,<br /> Thank goodness it's spring!!!  I am on the hunt for =
a  temporary/permanent roommate to share a great apartment in Red Hook,  Br=
ooklyn.  <br /> <br /> A Bit About Me:<br /> My name is Jamie and I am a 36=
 year old male who has lived in New York  now for 11 years this past  April=
.  A year (or so) ago December, I  graduated Hunter College with a Bachelor=
's degree in sociology and a  minor in mathematics.  I currently tend bar i=
n the Carroll Gardens/Red  Hook area at a place called B61--which is undern=
eath a restaurant named  Alma  I have just applied for a masters program in=
 education and am also  pursuing the idea of opening my own bar.       <br =
/> <br /> The Apartment: <br /> The apartment is approximately 900 sq. feet=
 and has two nice size  bedrooms, each with a big closet. It has a newly re=
novated large kitchen  that I must say is rather incredible. There is a goo=
d area for dining  that is connected to both the kitchen and the living roo=
m area. There is  one bathroom that is a decent size.  The apartment is in =
Red Hook,  Brooklyn, on Dikeman Street, between Dwight and Richards. It is =
a quiet  street that has a very old school neighborhood feel.  Ah yes, ther=
e is  also a big back yard that is in the process of being landscaped again=
,  post Sandy. <br /> <br /> Specifics:<br /> Rent: $900 + bills (around $8=
0)<br /> Where: 38 Dikeman Street, Brooklyn <br /> When: May 1st (could be =
flexible) <br /> <br /> An Important Note:  as mentioned before, I am looki=
ng for a  temporary/permanent roommate.  The reason for this statement is t=
hat  there is some ongoing drama between the two owners of my building.   T=
here is a very slight possibility that the apartment will need to be  vacat=
ed within 4-6 months, hence the temporary portion of statement.   There is =
a higher probability that absolutely nothing will happen as a  result of th=
e owner drama in which I would be open to having a longer  term roommate...=
..    <br /> <br /> Honestly, this is a fantastic apartment in an up and co=
ming  neighborhood; so if you are looking for a room for rent, you have fou=
nd a  good one. Drop me an e mail with a little information about yourself =
 and I will promptly respond. <br /> <br /> I look forward to meeting you<b=

new elevator building. The  bedroom comes with a double bed, a dresser, a n=

they allow direct  sun in mornings and face the garden, making it a surpris=

 I hold the lease. I reside in another city for the majority of the time  a=
nd so, am rarely there. It is minimally furnished (pots, pans, beds,  chair=

ilities are extra, but the internet and Con Ed rarely amount  to more than =
$100 total, and I am willing to share them with you on a  pro-rated basis.<=

r week) I  will sleep on the couch/bed in the living room. When I am in NYC=

 This situation is available now. Ideally I am looking for someone who  wil=
l want it through at least the end of Sept. 2013. There is the very  strong=
 possibility of this situation continuing after Sept. Because I am  out of =
town a lot and its a hurry-up situation I am going to want some  references=

re, I am a serious working local Brooklyn composer/ singer/  artist/ arts n=
onprofit director who is offering the downstairs attached  studio apartment=
 of my live/ work duplex to another creative artist, or  just another adult=
 of NYC's counter culture.  <br /> <br /> This sizable, and clean apartment=
 for rent has it's own private street  enterance, and it's own full kitchen=
, and full bath.  It's 3 blocks from  both Graham ave, and Grand Ave L stat=
ion, laundry, and 10-15 minutes  from manhattan, door to door.   It's a ver=
y quiet street, in a very  desirable neighborhood.  <br /> <br /> There is =
nothing like this anymore for the price and value left in  Williamsburg, an=
d I want to  offer it to the right person, who could  really benefit from t=
heir own affordable space in this now highly priced  area.<br /> <br /> No =
pics or street name here, to keep this property off of the grid from willia=
mbsburg real estate developers.<br /> <br /> I record and rehearse frequent=
ly with acoustic instruments, voice,  piano, synthesizers chamber music, an=
d some light percussion in my  upstairs apartment, but not loud full band r=
ehearsals or rock music that  will keep you up very late at night, as I am =
a respectful neighbor.  <br /> <br /> I only ask that whomever moves in, un=
derstands and respects this  situation fully, and also allows me to be able=
 to record, and also does  not interrupt my live recordings with often blas=
ting music, loud art  fabrication (metal drilling, power saws) and loud par=
ties, etc.<br /> <br /> I am only getting this pricing deal because I have =
been an artist in the  neighborhood for over 10 years, and have a long rela=
tionship with the  landlord.<br /> <br /> Utilities and Hot Water Not inclu=
ded, however we are able to split an internet/ tv bill 2 ways.<br /> <br />=
 Please email me to tell me just a small bit about yourself, and to set up =

 (the space has a fire door on the side leading  to the yard). The space al=

 hasn't been developed as of yet. There are  plans afoot to have the space =
listed in Bushwick Open Studios, so if  you have works you need to show you=

 to start a new lease keeping same rent till Aug  31, and rent may increase=
 a bit after that, but it's all negotiable. I  think you can get the place =
for $1500 a month with a one-year lease.<br /> <br /> Great location, super=
 clean and quiet, plenty of closet space. Steps to 6 train. Three blocks fr=
om 2,3.<br /> <br /> Good credit required and background check (just $100, =
no other fees).<br /> Any questions, please ask! <br /> Thanks!<br /><br />=

00 per month, Brooklyn, Gardener / Filmmaker / Positive Guy Seeks Room<br /=
> Available: ASAP through LONG TERM<br /><br /> My name is Ryan and I am 24=
-year-old male looking for a new place to  call home in New York. I was rec=
ently subletting a room in Park Slope  and my time is up! I have good credi=
t, proof of solid income, etc...  I  am looking to live in Ditmas Park, Par=
k Slope, Carroll Gardens,  Greenpoint, Clinton Hill, Bed-Stuy, Cobble Hill,=
 Brooklyn Heights or  Fort Greene. Although I'm open to just about anything=
 if it fits me.<br /> <br /> I am a positive, considerate person, a cinemat=
ographer and filmmaker,  record collector, avid cyclist, gardener, composte=
r, homebrewer,  environmentally conscious guy looking for a new place to li=
ve. I have  lived in large community settings with families as well as smal=
ler  situations. <br /> <br /> I am a southerner, originally from Kentucky,=
 and I'm looking for a real,  relaxing, home environment. Someplace that is=
 comfortable and doesn't  feel like an apartment. Open spaces, maybe a fron=
t porch, a yard, a  place to drink iced tea on a hot afternoon. Am I dreami=
ng?<br /> <br /> I kind of fell in love with the whole urban homesteading m=
ovement as of  late. I grew up gardening and I'd love to keep doing so. My =
last house  had chickens in the front yard. If your place has a backyard or=
  frontyard that I can potentially garden and/or have chickens in that is a=
  HUGE PLUS, but not a dealbreaker. <br /> <br /> I have a car (makes bring=
ing home groceries much easier!) I am also a member of the Park Slope Food =
Co-op.<br /> <br /> I love all kinds of music and I'm willing to share what=
 I have to listen  to. I have a somewhat large record collection that alway=
s seems to be  growing. By large I mean, 250+ albums. <br /> <br /> I am an=
 avid hiker/backpacker and love trying to summit very tall mountains (and s=
horter ones). <br /> <br /> My budget is a maximum of 1200.00 per month alt=
hough I'm looking to pay  less so I can continue to work freelance on perso=
nal projects and low  budget independent films. That being said, if the pla=
ce is right, I am  willing to work for it.<br /> <br /> Please email me if =
you think I'd be a good fit in your place. We can  work out a time for me t=
o come see the space. My schedule is fairly  flexible. <br /> <br /> kindly=
