Available: Nov 01, 2014

To anyone looking for a great new studio space to work in, I have been as=
ked to refer you to a new art studio project. I&#39;ve had my studio in t=
he same building for many years now, and it truly is a wonderful place to=
 work!=20

Because it&#39;s a brand new build out, there are many different spaces a=
vailable. The prices begin at $1025-$1350 for the medium-large ones. All =
have massive windows, and and are perfect size for sharing.

And then there are the truly enormous spaces with FAR more space and even=
 more windows. These range anywhere from $1400 - $4000.=20

Each space will have plenty of light and ventilation, as well as a heat a=
nd AC unit in every space. The building also provides gorgeous rooftop vi=
ews, 24 hour access and security, and an enormous loading dock and freigh=
t elevator.=20

For those not familiar with the area, it&#39;s generally thought of as a =
safe, quiet Brooklyn neighborhood. The building is just a few blocks from=
 the G train, with plenty of food options and easy street parking.

I have had my own art studio in this building for almost 4 years, and the=
 management has asked me to help get interest in the new spaces as they a=
re expanding the number of studios in the building. I will be the one sho=
wing the spaces and there are absolutely NO fees involved.

If you&#39;re interested, please text Jordan. I look forward to hearing f=
rom you. Thanks!

$489.00 Per Month, Union Sq., New York, Lovely Union Sq. Studio Share
Available: Nov 15, 2014

We are two costume designers now looking for someone to take the third sp=
ot in our lovely Union Square studio, as our last studiomate has outgrown=
 the space. The new person will have the nice third corner by the window =
and will pay $489/month (a third of the total cost) within a 14&#39;x17&#=
39; studio. Here&#39;s some info on the space:

-Right on Union Square, an amazing location, with the farmer&#39;s market=
 4 days/week right out the front door
-7th floor with windows on two sides of the room - one facing a nice skyl=
ine, the other facing an amazing view of never-ending fire escapes
-24/7 access
-Heat, A/C, electric included
-A slop sink and mini-fridge in the room
-4 wall-mounted shelves that are 4&#39; long reserved for you, sturdy eno=
ugh for books
-Newly renovated bathrooms on the floor
-Wifi already installed for an additional $20/month
-Amazing studio-mates, both costume designers, with one often out of town=
 (so the studio is rarely full)
-Really great building staff - the super is on our floor and very nice an=
d helpful
-Building mostly filled with artists so everyone is pretty friendly

The space is a little tight for a set designer, but would be great for a =
costume, lighting or sound designer, or a director or writer, or anyone e=
lse that mostly uses a desk space/shelving. There are occasionally meetin=
gs in the space, and we would love to share the space with someone that w=
as open to being slightly communal. Also, we are in the process of puttin=
g in laminate wood flooring, and repainting--so the photo is not quite ac=
curate, since we have had to move things around--please come by to view.

n comfortable well lit office
Available: Nov 01, 2014

I&#39;m looking to time-share my office. I use it from Monday to Friday, =
am looking for someone who&#39;d use it on the weekend. It&#39;s halfway =
between downtown Brooklyn and Dumbo. It has a big window, a desk, an ergo=
nomic desk chair, a tasteful Barcalounger recliner (no that&#39;s not an =
oxymoron, it is rather one of the most comfortable chairs I&#39;ve ever s=
at in), a desk lamp, a floor lamp, a filing cabinet, a little coffee tabl=
e, a little rug, a little closet. I am a novelist and professor. The pers=
on I&#39;ve been sharing the space with is a poet. It&#39;s a good place =
for writers and/or scholars, among others.

$400.00 Per Month, chinatown/little italy, Manhattan, 160 sq. ft., privat=
e space for quiet work, writing or similar/ bodywork
Available: Nov 01, 2014

I have a beautiful new space I use for body-work, i.e. massage, etc. that=
&#39;s also perfect for quiet-work like writing, etc. I would like to off=
er it to another healing practitioner OR artist for up to 3 days a week.=20=

It&#39;s on Broome just below Bowery so it&#39;s convenient to the JM/ NR=
Q/ BD/ and 6 trains.=20
My space is up a flight of easy, wide stairs on a floor with 4 other arti=
sts.=20
The space has new walls, a new wood floor, a silver-leaf door, and a beau=
tiful skylight! It&#39;s serene.=20
The room is about 160sq. ft. so there&#39;s ample room for a small group =
(2-4), like for Pilates or Yoga.=20
I have a small seating area, yoga mats, a desk, file cabinet, an Ikea cre=
denza for sheets, and my bodywork table.=20
This table is easily put away so that you can use the space however you l=
ike.
Otherwise, it has a bohemian atmosphere very different than a healing cen=
ter/office type one. It&#39;s so refreshing having a whole studio to your=
self for this kind of work. Outside my space it&#39;s not pristine, like =
I say, it is an artists building, but it&#39;s cool. The bathroom isn&#39=
;t super fancy either, but it&#39;s quite new and very clean. My clients =
love the space and find it a comfortable setting for receiving bodywork. =
I don&#39;t play music, but you could if you want.=20
The neighborhood is hip and lively and there are a variety of cafes and e=
ateries close by.=20
The space would be ideal for any type of quiet need, or clean work, and e=
specially Feldenkrais, Rolfing, Alexander technique, Massage, private yog=
a, Reflexology, etc.

Monthly rate as a practitioner: $225 for 1/2 day, $395 for 1 full day, $7=
00 for 2 days/week
Rate decrease with more days...
To use the space for other types of work is cheaper, at a rate of $450/mo=
nth for 2 days/week
Rate decrease with more days...

e in Gorgeous Townhouse
Available: Nov 01, 2014

Hello!

My roommate and I are looking for a third person for a new apartment. =20=


A little about us- I am a multimedia artist/teaching artist and my roomma=
te is a designer and graduate student at SVA. We both cook, keep a neat h=
ouse, and are usually pretty busy. =20

The apartment is a huge renovated two-floor in a townhouse with early 20t=
h c. exposed brick throughout.  There is a gigantic living room area with=
 two mantels, a kitchen area with a dishwasher and updated appliances, an=
d a large back room with a balcony, which we are planning on turning into=
 a shared workspace. =20

There are three bathrooms in the apartment in total, all brand new.  We h=
ave the option of installing a washer/dryer unit, and the apartment has c=
entral air and heat and great insulation.  It&#39;s a quiet street near t=
he Gates J stop, and the owner is responsive and nice.=20

Ideally we would like someone on the lease with us for their room, as we&=
#39;re closing on the apartment for a year lease starting November 1st. W=
e would all be splitting utilities and wi-fi. However, we are open to sho=
rt term stays also.

We look forward to speaking with you!

$960.00 Per Month, Bushwick, Brooklyn, Spacious room in 2 br, 1 block fro=
m L train at Jefferson Street
Available: Dec 01, 2014

Hello,

I&#39;m living abroad this year, but I want to hold on to my room in Bush=
wick because it&#39;s spacious, convenient and a really great place to li=
ve. It&#39;s also rent-stabilized, which is a plus. There&#39;s a chance =
I&#39;ll move back to NYC next summer (2015), but most likely if you want=
 to hold on to the room you&#39;re welcome to stay there and I may eventu=
ally want someone to take over the lease.=20

The room is furnished with a bed, bureau, shelves and desk. It&#39;s extr=
emely spacious, and looks out on the street.  Just a few blocks from Mari=
a Hernandez Park and lots of coffee shops, restaurants and a big grocery =
store. I&#39;ve loved living in this neighborhood, and it&#39;s getting n=
icer all the time. 15 minutes to Union Square on the L, and the M train i=
sn&#39;t far.

The other room is already filled by a laid-back girl in her early 20s wit=
h a 9-5 job, and now I&#39;m hoping to find someone to fill this room for=
 December 1. You won&#39;t have to sign a lease, but will require first m=
onth and full deposit to move in. Prefer female roommate if possible.

Since I&#39;ll be leaving my apartment with you (and the other roommate, =
Shayla), my hope is to find someone who will be into having a mellow, sta=
ble environment at home and will be respectful of the apartment/my furnit=
ure/etc. Please contact the provided email address if you&#39;re interest=
ed, and the girl who currently lives in the other room will coordinate wh=
en you might be able to stop by. Thanks!

$1,000.00 Per Month, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 160 sq. ft., great location,=
 back yard, workspace, roof
Available: Nov 15, 2014

I&#39;m a Brooklyn based artist who would be glad to stay here if I weren=
&#39;t moving in with my girlfriend. We have an available room in our spa=
cious two story, two bathroom, four bedroom apartment. There are two bedr=
ooms on each floor, in addition to a large work space and an enormous bac=
kyard with a deck. Perfect for cook outs, plants, etc. We have access to =
the roof, which has a great view of the Manhattan skyline during sunset. =
The kitchen is fully equipped with a dishwasher and all necessary applian=
ces.  All of the roommates--including a friendly mid sized dog named Zeld=
a--are considerate and respectful. At Wythe Ave., between Broadway and so=
uth 8th, it&#39;s the ideal location in my opinion. Slightly removed from=
 the chaos of Williamsburg, but still conveniently situated and safe at a=
ll times. It&#39;s an 8 minute walk from the J,M,Z marcy stop, and 15 min=
utes to the Bedford L. Just south of the Williamsburg bridge, a bike comm=
ute into manhattan is pleasant and easy. There&#39;s also an East River F=
erry stop two blocks away. Plenty of good restaurants nearby too.=20

t., Quiet Roommate Wanted for Huge Renovated Brooklyn Apartment
Available: Dec 01, 2014

I am looking for a female roommate with whom to share an enormous and bea=
utiful Pre-War apartment within walking distance of Prospect Park. This i=
s an ideal situation for a writer, academic, or other professional who sp=
ends most of their time at home working or relaxing quietly. With the rig=
ht person, it could be fun to have a library/coffee shop work vibe in nue=
stra casa.

About the space:

nd hardwood floors. The entire space was remodeled within the last 15 yea=
rs and is in excellent condition with a big living room *and* separate di=
ning room as well as a kitchen that could be adapted to suit someone with=
 some amount of culinary ambition.
So, the apartment is *huge*, and because there is so much room in the com=
mon area, a dedicated work space could be negotiated. Oh, and you would j=
ust share it with ONE person.

Me:
I ...=20
...am female artist/academic/writer in my mid thirties.
...am somewhat nerdy and into books, going to galleries, NPR, and the nei=
ghborhood farmers market.
...spend most of my time at home writing, grading, or reading, so the apa=
rtment needs to be quiet.=20
...am an introvert; home is my sanctuary, so I really need for it to be a=
 place to recoup my energy.=20

You:
are...
...female
...financially stable, (i.e. able to pay rent and bills on time).=20
...over 25.=20
...pet-free.
...responsible, honest, communicative, friendly, and somewhat easy going.=

...preferring to spend your time at home doing mostly quiet activities, b=
ut are ok with some street noise (the neighborhood is lively).
...fairly tidy and willing to help with keeping the place clean.
...ok with a shoe-free household.
...wanting to stay for at least 1 year.

Bonus if:
you...
...have furniture, or are at least excited about helping me decorate.=20
...prefer to use minimally scented or eco-friendly cleaning and body prod=
ucts (I have a perfume allergy).

To move in:=20
Rent x 3 =3D First month + security deposit + last months rent=20

Utilities:=20
Heat/water is included. We pay for electricity and water.

About the building and area:
The building is a community with kind and attentive landlords on a tree-l=
ined street with everything nearby. This includes multiple laundry and gr=
ocery options, pharmacies, several banks, delis, etc. If you like organic=
 food, the highlights are the Flatbush Food Co-op and the farmers market =
on Cortelyou. There are also plenty of excellent restaurants and bars.
One of the best parts is that the neighborhood is lovely with lots of tre=
es, gardens, and large Victorian homes and is only around a 25 minute tra=
in ride from lower Manhattan with your choice of two express trains.

wer East Side
Available: Nov 15, 2014 through May 31, 2015

Sunny, adorable room available in a two bedroom apartment across the stre=
et from Seward Park on the Lower East Side.=20

In the heart of this exciting, bustling neighborhood, this is a lovely, q=
uiet block facing tree-filled Seward Park. A perfect mix of LES and China=
town, you can find the best dumplings, newest hip restaurants, and your n=
eighborhood dive all in a few-block radius. With Cafe Grumpy and a new ju=
ice bar right downstairs, and Beverly&#39;s and Clockwork bars just down =
the street (though out of earshot), this block is a friendly little neigh=
borhood all of its own.=20

My roommate is moving out in mid-November, and I am looking for someone t=
o fill her place. The apartment is a third-floor walk-up with exposed bri=
ck throughout, hardwood floors, a white tile bathroom, and air conditione=
rs in both the living room and your bedroom. The open bedroom is the larg=
er of the two, with two sunny windows and your own private closet. The be=
droom is unfurnished and the living room and kitchen are fully furnished.=


About me: I am a female in her late twenties working in contemporary art.=
 I spend most of my time out of the house, both at work and otherwise, am=
 tidy, outgoing, and friendly.

About you: You are a mid-twenties to mid-thirties male or female who is c=
lean, considerate, and friendly. There are plenty of places in the neighb=
orhood to play, so as it is a cozy apartment I ask that you not bring the=
 party home, as it were. No pets and no smoking in the apartment.

The F train is less than a block away, the B and D trains about a five mi=
nute walk at Grand Street, and the J, M, and Z trains an equal walk to Es=
sex Street. Getting uptown, across town, to downtown Brooklyn, and Willia=
msburg/Bushwick is incredibly convenient.=20

Rent is $1400/month and utilities usually run about $40/month. First mont=
h and one month security deposit to move in. Long term commitment preferr=
ed; three months absolute minimum.

$900.00 Per Month, Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, 100 sq. ft., Room for Rent=
 in Spacious 3-Bedroom Apartment
Available: Nov 15, 2014

Hello there Listings Project readers! For your consideration: a bedroom f=
or rent in a beautiful, spacious apartment in Prospect Heights. The bedro=
om is quiet, private, and offers ample space for a full bed, desk and dre=
sser, with more than enough closet space. The apartment (which is on the =
1st floor by the European system) features a big living room, big kitchen=
, and is located mere minutes away from the wonders of Prospect Park (inc=
luding the Botanical Gardens, Brooklyn Library, Brooklyn Museum). You wou=
ld live a stone&#39;s throw away from wonderful Franklin Avenue, with its=
 cafes, boutique shops, friendly bars and easygoing vibe. To the west, Va=
nderbilt Ave beckons with speakeasies and other local flair. We are borde=
red by the quaintness of Crown Heights and the long-established resources=
 of Park Slope. The Prospect Park Shuttle (S) is one block away. Walk ten=
 minutes south and you are at the 2,3,4,5 trains. Walk ten minutes to the=
 north and you are at the C train at the Franklin or Clinton-Washington s=
tations.

You would be living with two roommates, both hard-working professionals w=
ith a literary bent. Roommate #1, Christy, female, works in marketing for=
 the arts. Roommate #2, Chris, male, is a writer of fiction and faculty m=
ember in NYU&#39;s Creative Writing Program. He is originally from rural =
New Hampshire, and still loves his home state and most things about it (e=
specially the landscape; not so much the politics).

We are both clean, mature, responsible and err on the quiet side. We do n=
ot hold raucous parties but are interested in a roommate who could help u=
s to continue making a home out of this wonderful space. =20

We are looking for someone who is likewise clean, mature, responsible and=
 employed. Preference will be given to those who hold regular work hours =
outside of home. If all this appeals to you, then you probably appeal to =
us! Just drop us a line at the listed e-mail address and tell us a little=
 about your passions and your work (or both, if they coincide). Thanks fo=
r reading, and we look forward to meeting you!

$1,050.00 Per Month, Crown Heights, Brooklyn, 150 sq. ft., Furnished Room=
 in a Spacious 3-bd Apartment in Crown Heights
Available: Dec 15, 2014 through Apr 30, 2015

Hey all, I&#39;m looking to sublet my lovely room in Crown Heights for a =
few months beginning in December, with a return date most likely May 1st,=
 possibly a bit earlier or later. Dec 15th is the move-in date, though I =
could possibly handle Dec 1st if necessary.

The room comes fully furnished with a queen size bed, desk, chair and lar=
ge built-in bookshelf, as well as a small dresser-on-wheels and lots of c=
abinet space. It&#39;s a smallish room in a large apartment, adjacent to =
the very spacious living room, with a big kitchen with lots of natural li=
ght (even in winter) and rooftop access which will be cold in the coming =
months but still a nice view of BK and Manhattan from four stories up (an=
d great for bbqs in April).

I am a writer taking a four-month retreat out of the city to get some wor=
k done. Roommates are two graduate students, both women, one in film stud=
ies at NYU, the other in gender studies at Rutgers. They are excellent pe=
ople, considerate, intelligent, and quiet and clean as roommates.

We live on Park Place between Franklin and Bedford, which I guess you cou=
ld pretty much call the heart of the burgeoning Crown Heights. Every bar =
or cafe or restaurant you could ever want is within a three or four block=
 radius. It&#39;s pretty sweet. Across the street is a bookstore and 24-h=
r laundromat, 24-hour corner store at the end of the block. Lovely neighb=
ors on a quiet tree-covered street. Brooklyn Museum is a 5-10 min walk, b=
eautiful Prospect Park and the Brooklyn Library a little beyond that.

Utilities are usually $50 a month for gas/electric/internet. Please email=
 me with any questions.

Thanks!

m facing a courtyard on Java Street
Available: Nov 19, 2014 through Jan 07, 2015

Room available in our quiet, sunny and clean 2BR on Java Street.

The room has big windows facing a back courtyard full of trees, is quiet =
and sunny, and is fully furnished with a queen-sized bed, leather reading=
 chair, desk and desk chair, high end stereo and record player, and all t=
he drawers, shelves and closet space you need.

I share the apartment with my roommate Paul.  We are both in our early-to=
-mid 30&#39;s and artists, and both mellow and laid back.  He is often go=
ne during the day for work.  We share a nice kitchen with full appliances=
 and a table with chairs, as well as a bathroom which we keep nice and cl=
ean.  Your room has its own private entrance, as well as its own private =
entrance to the kitchen.  So if you want privacy this is definitely the a=
partment for you.

It&#39;s one block away from the Greenpoint Ave G stop in the heart of Gr=
eenpoint.  Tons of great restaurants and shops in the neighborhood.  A sh=
ort bike ride / walk to Williamsburg, and a quick subway ride into either=
 Lower Manhattan or Midtown.

The rent is $800/month plus utilities.  This kind of deal only exists in =
this neighborhood due to a longstanding relationship with our landlord wh=
o has been kind enough not to raise the rent.   =20

With the kitchen, connected by a private entrance to my room, the space i=
s around 474 sq ft. =20

I travel for work and so will be subletting my space for these two months=
.  I am looking for a clean, considerate, non-smoker to rent the apartmen=
t.

I am going back home for the holidays, so this room is available now thro=
ugh till January.=20

It&#39;s a beautiful big room on a quiet, leafy street with two large win=
dows to perch in. The room has a wardrobe and separate entrance so is ver=
y private. It feels like a studio except the bathroom and kitchen are acr=
oss the hall. Two lovely housemates are across the way, but I barely see =
them as the room is large, airy, and functional enough to host friends an=
d have meals. The room is clean and there is a comfortable bed and I can =
provide linen and pillows. Important note: the room has toasty radiator.=20=


There is a full-sized kitchen, lounge room and bathroom in the main apart=
ment. The apartment is in a very covetable part of Brooklyn. Its right ne=
ar McGolrick part, which has a farmers market every Sunday. Great coffee =
nearby at Variety cafe and nice restaurants Little Dokebi and Selamat Pag=
i only a street away. There are bodegas on both ends of the street if its=
 cold and you have to dash out for something. The G and L trains are both=
 a short walk, so is Bedford Avenue, Manhattan Avenue, and everything tha=
t goes on in Williamsburg. Once you&#39;re on the L train it&#39;s only f=
ive minutes (a real five minutes, not a craigslist five minutes) to 1st a=
venue in Manhattan. The street is incredibly quiet and in the morning the=
 room has a lot of light so winter feels less dreary. I work in book publ=
ishing so you won&#39;t be short of books to read during your stay.=20

ly fits a queen-sized bed, couch, desk and chair with extra floor space!
* $1460/month per person plus about $65/each for utilities

Tompkinsville, on the north shore of Staten Island, is changing rapidly. =
 There is a microbrewery with outside seating across the street.  There i=
s a dedicated art community with a surprising number of jazz  musicians.

We are two artists, Ron and Miriam.   Ron&#39;s studio is on the first fl=
oor.

This loft has housed many illustrious artists over the years.  Douglas Ko=
lk and Gary Simmons were young artists here. Terry Fox, the great video a=
rtist,
lived here with his family during the time he lived in New York in the 80=
&#39;s before moving back to Europe.  Cynthia Pannucci, Director of Art a=
nd Science Collaborations, ran her non-profit from this loft.=20

 Proof of income as well as references from earlier landlords or other so=
urces would be needed. There is no fee at this time for the space.

We would prefer someone who loves living here and can enjoy all that it h=
as to offer. We have most enjoyed renting to creative people who can appr=
eciate the opportunity to work in a space where they can concentrate. Thi=
s apartment has housed single artists, couples, and, at one time, a coupl=
e with one small child.

Last year a new roof was installed, the building brick was pointed, and t=
he cornice was rebuild and painted. A man down the street does most of th=
e repairs in the apartment when necessary. The building front area is sur=
rounded on three sides with a low iron fence and the backyard is surround=
ed by a high wood fence to insure privacy.

Lovely, Furnished two bedroom apartment in N. Williamsburg for Sublet, on=
e block from McCarren Park. Dates Flexible. Photos available upon request=
.

The apartment is incredibly convenient: it&#39;s 4 blocks to the Bedford =
Ave. L train stop (one stop to the East Village in Manhattan.)  It&#39;s =
just off McCarren Park-- near restaurants, cafes, bars, groceries, the Ea=
st River, galleries, boutiques, gyms, yoga studios, health food stores, e=
tc. =20

The apartment was completely remodeled a few years ago.  It is clean, sun=
ny and very comfortable: many tall windows in every room, lots of sun, ne=
w hardwood floors, big-for- NY kitchen, high ceilings, recessed lighting,=
 air conditioning, bathroom with bathtub. There is also high speed intern=
et. The apartment is on the 3rd floor so it&#39;s high enough for good st=
reet views from all rooms, but still easy to get to.=20

The front bedroom is a spacious corner room with plenty of space to sprea=
d out and a private entrance. It has a queen sized bed, a desk and three =
tall windows for lots of light.
The second bedroom is also a sunny corner room with 3 ceiling-tall window=
s and a double bed. It&#39;s a bit smaller than the first. Both rooms hav=
e ample closet space. The bedrooms are at opposite sides of the apartment=
 providing each room with privacy do it&#39;s perfect for roommates or a =
couple and a roommate.

The whole kitchen was replaced during the remodel including appliances an=
d is stocked with quality cookware, dishes, etc.

There have been some furniture changes since the  pictures were taken but=
 not much.

This was my apartment for a few years and I loved living in it, but I hav=
e recently moved in with my boyfriend so I&#39;d like to sublet the whole=
 apartment for the winter months.
I will be living in Williamsburg for the winter so will be available shou=
ld any issues come up. The building super is aware the apartment will be =
sublet and is very trustworthy, nice and attentive to any maintenance nee=
ds.

I am trustworthy and reliable and I want a friendly, professional, reliab=
le situation for the sublet. I am looking for sub-tenants who want the sa=
me.
I am happy to provide references for people who have sublet from me in pa=
st and who have been very happy.

I will want to run a credit check on whoever will inhabit the apartment. =
So to do this I&#39;ll need you to fill out a rental application and give=
 me permission for a credit check. if you move in, I&#39;ll cover the cos=
ts for the check.
Deposit required plus first months rent.
Electricity is extra (internet, gas and water are included in sublet pric=
e.) I can give you cost estimates on the bills.
I&#39;d like to sublet for 3-4 months but I&#39;m flexible on length and =
move in and out dates.
3 people max for the subletting. Though temporary guests are ok, of cours=
e. And for this, the couch in the livingroom is a pullout futon that slee=
ps two.

I am a tv producer and am in and out of town till end November. When I am=
 in town, I will show it. If I am out of town, the current subletters hav=
e agreed to show it. As a last option if they are busy, my boyfriend Lee =
will show it (he has shown it once already.) There is no fee. I am not a =
broker or an agent. I am the leaseholder and this is my apartment.

$1,475.00 Per Month, East Village, New York, New York, 350 sq. ft., Your =
Sunny, Affordable East Village Apartment
Available: Jan 06, 2015 through May 06, 2015

We love our adorable 1 bedroom apartment in one of the coolest neighborho=
ods in NYC, and so will you. $1475 a month includes a fully furnished pad=
 with electricity, internet, and bi-weekly cleaning service. This will be=
 an official sublet which the landlord and the super will be aware of, so=
 no one will need to skulk about. Which is calming, right?=20

The place is a 5 floor walkup on 10th Street between 1st and A. (You&#39;=
ll get used to it, and the walkup will give you nicely defined calf muscl=
es.) It&#39;s a nice block. Awesome Sushi, Ramen, Mexican, Vietnamese, Fi=
lipino, Moroccan, and Greek food with a five block radius. And Tompkins S=
quare Park! Farmers market on Sundays! Yeah!=20

The apartment itself is very sunny. It&#39;s got a nice little kitchen of=
f the living room which is fully stocked with all kinds of cookware. (Vit=
amix, aka best blender in all of creation, a food processor, lots of quir=
ky coffee mugs, etc), and a separate bedroom which is small but quiet and=
 has a full queen sized bed. The living room is perfect for lounging abou=
t and eating bonbons, if you&#39;re into that sort of thing.=20

Here comes the quirky part of the apartment: there&#39;s no bathroom. The=
re&#39;s a little room with only a toilet, a little room with only a show=
er, and a kitchen sink. But no bathroom. Two people who were not sleeping=
 in the same bed could stay here, although it would be a bit of a tight s=
queeze. (It&#39;s about 350 square feet.) But we&#39;re a couple and we&#=
39;re doing just fine in here!  Finally, the joint&#39;s just a 5 minute =
subway ride from Willamsburg and 15 minute walks to both Union Square and=
 SoHo, and just so close to so many cool things.=20

And a final word on the matter: on those cold winter nights when you just=
 want to stay in, watch Netflix, and drink hot chocolate (with or without=
 peppermint schnapps), this apartment will be a wonderful, cozy place to =
come home to. =20

So, yeah: Welcome Home!=20

 new hard wood floors.

Available November 1 for short or long term lets (prefer long term).

Its not often that you come across a true one bedroom apartment of this s=

light. I cherish staying in and cooking or watching a movie while having =

wing machine as well as my professional size 6 dress form.
I will be around the first week or so of January to help you move in and =
assimilate, though not staying in the apartment. After that, I have entru=
sted keys with my good friend who will be in contact should anything aris=
e.

My neighborhood is very safe and my neighbors are tremendously friendly. =
My apartment is on the same block as the ymca as well as half a block fro=
m a metropolitan grocery store.

I do ask, however that you water my plants just once a week. But if that =
is an issue, my friend would gladly take care of them.


My building is a quiet one. I like to respect my neighbors and refrain fr=
om loud late nights or too many guests.

Please no pets allowed. My boyfriend and I have a severe allergy to cats.=
 It would be devastating to come back home and experience and allergy att=
ack. : \

r 3 train on 135th street, or an 8 min walk to the 4 or 5 train right acr=
oss the bridge into the Bronx. That gives you access to both east and wes=
tside of the city. The M1 bus literally is across the street and up the b=
lock gets you the M7 or the M102. I get down to Times Square in about 20 =
min, Union Square in 30.

The block is super quiet, and the building resides in a gated community w=
ith intercom service for deliveries and guests. There is also 24hr securi=
ty so you should feel extra safe. I have never had any issues with this a=
rea for the last 4 years. It is truly a Harlem gem.

Harlem River is essentially across the street giving you access to benche=
s that overlook the river for a some quiet downtime. Within ten minutes y=
ou can reach Central Park or any of the smaller, charming parks around th=
e area. Harlem gives you so much around 125th Street with great award win=
ning restaurants and tons of shops. And for those who cook, right up the =
block is Key Food for all your grocery needs. A large dollar store is nex=
t to Key Food as well, which houses some great deals of course!=20

I am an extremely clean, friendly, mid 30&#39;s working professional who =
decided to make a change in my life and move to California. I wish I coul=
d just transplant this apartment cross country but since I can&#39;t, I n=
eed someone to enjoy this apartment until the lease ends in April (the en=
d of April). It sounds simple but I need a trustworthy individual or coup=
le who can pay the rent which includes everything, all utilities included=
: Electric, Gas, Water, Verizon Fios with every channel, and unlimited Wi=
fi. I am not making a dime off of the tenant, just looking to break even.=
 If you&#39;re a working professional or couple who needs something that =
has great space, location, and comfort then look no further. This home wi=
ll meet your needs I guarantee it :)

$1,950.00 Per Month, Bed Stuy, Brooklyn, Beautiful Spacious 1 bdrm in Bro=
wnstone
Available: Nov 13, 2014 through Jan 15, 2015

I can&#39;t praise this place more. I really love it. I found this apt an=
d finally felt really at home in NY. I love the neighbors, everyone&#39;s=
 so open and friendly - it&#39;s a real sense of neighborhood/community. =
You&#39;ll probably get invited to the neighborhood chess game within a f=
ew days of being here. :) There&#39;s such a vibrancy in the neighborhood=
. There&#39;s a large Caribbean (Trinidadian) population and then also yo=
ur influx of the &#39;new&#39;.  You have your little coffee shops and ju=
ice and bars and even a great creperie too. Fulton street is one block aw=
ay which is the major commercial/business vein that stretches through dow=
ntown brooklyn to us in bedstuy. So you have all kinds of stores and life=
 there, but you don&#39;t feel it at all by the house.
The apartment is in a great old Brownstone. There are four total units, t=
his one occupies the third floor (two easy flights of steps).  It has two=
 rooms (with windows on both ends!) separated by a big sliding pocket doo=
r. The bedroom which is huge, I painted a lilac color and is my peaceful =
quiet room (tv, yoga, etc). It has new carpet and large windows that glow=
 at sunset. Then the &#39;living&#39; room (where I put my computer desk =
and dining table) - which is smaller but still a good size, very open and=
 bright - I painted it a pale yellow as it&#39;s the more energetic room.=
 It has great wood floors that reflect the sun that pours in during the d=
ay.
The kitchen is small but doable with all new appliances. I cook in there =
all the time and like the openness to the living/dining room.=20
The bathroom&#39;s a bathroom! haha Not much to it, but things are new an=
d it has a tub. Kitchen and bath both a nice peach color.
I moved in June 1st, and I travel constantly for work. So I&#39;m still s=
ettling in a bit. I don&#39;t have much furniture - I like to keep it sim=
ple and spacious.=20
I have a nice computer and tv and even a projector (filmmaker needs!). No=
 couch (on purpose) much to girlfriend&#39;s chagrin, but I prefer just u=
sing pillows on the floor. I&#39;m still debating getting one. She may co=
nvince me.
So things are nice and well done in here, but simple and with character. =
My friends joke that I&#39;ve set up the quintessential BK professional a=
rtist life.=20

Transpo:
Toward Manhattan... It&#39;s about 3 blocks from the A/C at Nostrand and =
the same from the C stop at Franklin. I&#39;ve managed to get to chinatow=
n in 18 minutes, but your usually looking at 25 mins to southern manhatta=
n, chinatown, soho area.  35 to midtown. It&#39;s really a practical spot=
.
In Brooklyn:  it&#39;s about a 10-15 min walk to the G line on Bedford (t=
o get to Williamsburg/Greenpoint etc). Also the B44 bus to Williamsburg i=
s right at the corner which is really easy and pleasant. The B26 bus to d=
owntown brooklyn is right in front of the house too.=20

$900.00 Per Month, Brooklyn or lower Manhattan, nyc, Fun, Busy Roommate w=
ith Big Dreams and a Real Job looking for a Bright, Warm, Social, &amp; C=
lean New Home
Available: Nov 01, 2014

Hello!

I&#39;m looking for a room in Brooklyn or lower Manhattan, very close to =
the train. The things I need in an apartment are... lots of windows, lots=
 of heat, hardwood floors, and above all, awesome roommates!=20

I&#39;ve been traveling a ton since summer and have a flexible moving dat=
e, but I&#39;m hoping to settle into somewhere in November since I won&#3=
9;t be traveling so much anymore. I&#39;m looking to spend closer to $800=
, but I can go a little over $900 if it&#39;s really what I want.

Who I live with is as important to me as where I live. I am a social, cre=
ative, supportive, ambitious, adventurous person and I like to be around =
the same. Of course we all work hard in this city and need plenty of rest=
orative space to ourselves, but I&#39;m looking for an apartment of peopl=
e who genuinely enjoy each other&#39;s company and approach the space lik=
e it&#39;s a community, not like a dorm. If we&#39;re actually home at th=
e same time, I&#39;m going to want to make you a glass of whatever I&#39;=
m drinking and hear about how your big show/date/audition/interview went;=
 thats just how I&#39;m wired. I like to play and laugh and make things. =
If it&#39;s your routine to come home and cuddle up with Netflix, we are =
not going to be a good fit.=20

Also looking for people closer to my age (apparently I&#39;m 30) who have=
 their shit together and know how to successfully perform basic adult tas=
ks like paying rent, managing a job, and keeping the apartment clean. I l=
ove having a dog around but sadly am allergic to cats.

About me: I eat a lot of kale, and I dance. I walk across bridges because=
 I love them. I pay rent on time.

Thanks for reading my post!

Dear future roommate(s), my name is Samira, I&#39;m 31 years old and I&#3=
9;m originally from Munich/ Germany (well I am binational: part Egyptian/=
 part German :).=20

I&#39;m a lawyer and I am planning on getting my master&#39;s degree at t=
he University of San Diego School of Law (starting in the spring semester=
 2015). I&#39;ve lived in the United States before (foreign exchange year=
 in Iowa, internship in New York) and I&#39;m really excited about the op=
portunity to live in southern California for one school year.=20

I consider myself an open minded, friendly and respectful person who is p=
assionate about getting to know new people and especially foreign culture=
s (well I guess I&#39;m particularly interested in Arab countries). I try=
 to work out as much as I can and I really love going to art fairs whenev=
er I have the chance to. Also, my big mission while I&#39;m in San Diego =
is to finally learn surfing. So if you know how to surf, I would really a=
ppreciate a good teacher ;) I do go skiing during the winter though (the =
Alps are so close to Munich).=20

Anyway, if you have a cool and clean appartment to share in San Diego and=
 you think we could get along as roommates, please shoot me a message!=20=


By the way, not all Germans fulfill the worst prejudices.. some of them a=
re really likeable.. like myself :D Looking forward to hearing from you! =

bunch of instruments, and I always enjoy sharing them. I&#39;d like the k=

Hi! I am looking for a kind, creative young woman who wants to supplement=
 her art with a steady, part-time opportunity as an after school babysitt=
er for my 2 daughters ages 7 and 10. The girls love drawing, music (pop, =
I&#39;m sorry to say) and theater and the chance to hang out and play wit=
h someone cool and fun. I am ideally looking for someone who can work on =
Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays from 2:30-6:30, and who is up for taking =
the girls to after school activities, hosting occasional play dates, help=
ing with homework, and who is equally comfortable playing the evil queen =
and talking through tween angst. Our last sitter was an actress and it wo=
rked out great. We would love to support another artist and hope to hear =
from you if this sounds like it could be a fit. Please send me an email l=
etting me know a little about you and why you&#39;re interested.
