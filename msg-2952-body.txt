Hello List-
Here are listings as of 3/6/13
Listings Project Thank You's of the Week:
We actually found our apartment 2 years ago through your listing and love i=
t, have
a great landlord and fantastic neighbors! It was true serendipity on many l=
evels,
and we are very thankful.

A very happy spring to you!!
Best,
Carrie

I moved into a queer-friendly artists' co-op house I found through Listings=
 Project,
and I've never been so happy with where I've been living in New York.
Thanks,
Kim

My roommate and I moved from Australia to New York and in the time since ha=
ve lived
in 3 different sublets we found on Listings Project, for a total of almost =
8 months!
We have great things to say about each apartment, each subletter and each n=
eighborhood
(Williamsburg, Greenpoint and Astoria).
Thanks,
Brodie

$200 per month, Bushwick, 100 square feet, Time-share of small,  sound-insu=
lated
 studio / ideal for sound or video editing/production
Available: March 1
Studio specs:
-It's small! 100 square feet.  But also nice, with two small windows,  and =
is exactly
big enough for doing video/sound work.  (There's even a  piano in there at =
the moment
-- though the piano will leave at the end  of the month along with my curre=
nt studio-mate)
-The room is sound insulated, both through "sound resistant" paneling in th=
e walls,
and Auralex foam sound panels on the walls.
-It is shared with one person (me), a sound artist / composer.
-The rent for you would be $200/month, plus one month's deposit and a $50 k=
ey deposit.
Use of the studio:
-I currently use the studio for sound composition / editing, and have it  s=
et up
 with four speakers for quadrophonic sound work. (You are welcome  to use t=
he speakers
that are here, or bring your own.) The studio is  ideal for either sound or=
 video
editing / making, but could also be used  for any computer/desk-centric wor=
k.
-The studio is a time-share, rather than a space-share, to be shared  equal=
ly between
us, and there is 24-hour access to the building.  We can  negotiate how to =
best=20
split the time based on our schedules /  preferences, and I can be pretty f=
lexible
about when I go in.
-While it is a great place to make noise, and to listen, it's not the  best=
 space
for someone who wants to make extremely loud sound.
The attached photos are from *before* I set it up and added the sound  pane=
ls. But
I'm taking new photos this week, and am happy to send them!
Please get in touch if you have any questions or would like to come and vis=
it the
space!

ROOMS FOR RENT

$750 per month, Bushwick, Spacious Room for Rent
Available: April 1 through August 1
Large, front room with 2 windows available for rent in Bushwick 2 bedroom.
The room is, as I said, LARGE.  Current roommate has a chair, a giant  bed,=
 a book
case, a dressing stand, and easily 50 pairs of shoes in  there, and there i=
s still
a bunch of room to walk around.  The room has a  closet, and faces the stre=
et. =20
The heater is also in this room so it  stays nice and toasty.
The rest of the apartment includes a large kitchen, medium sized living  ro=
om and
a pretty tiny, but completely workable bathroom.  It is a  railroad apartme=
nt, so
you have your own entrance to your room, and then  use the main entrance to=
 get=20
to the rest of the apartment.
The neighborhood is fun-- you are a short walk from the bars on Broadway  (=
Skytown,
Bizarre Bar, Lone Wolf,) and about a 10 minute walk from The  Narrows, Pine=
 Box,
 and Roberta's and that whole area.  You are also 15  minutes from the city=
 on the
JMZ, which is 4 blocks away.  It's a ten  minute walk to the G or the L.  G=
rocery
stores, liquor store, coffee,  gym all super close.
Your roommate is also awesome.  I leave the apartment at 9ish and don't  us=
ually
 get back until 7 or 8.  It would be ideal if you worked nights--  it would=
 essentially
be like having the place to yourself.  That being  said, I'd like to live w=
ith a
 grown-up.  Please be respectful of noise  and reasonably tidy.  Not crazy =
is also
good.

$965 per month, Bushwick, 10 x 15, Awesome apartment in on  Jefferson L sto=
p
Available: April 1st through Open
Hi!
I am looking for a roommate for April 1st for my apartment off the  Jeffers=
on L=20
in Bushwick, Brooklyn. The available room is 10 x 15 and has  a big window =
that=20
lets in light and faces the courtyard. It's  unfurnished and at the opposit=
e end
 of the apartment from my room, so  there is a lot of privacy. The apartmen=
t itself
is quite spacious with a  lot of natural light. This neighborhood is awesom=
e because
it's right  by the park and there are a lot of new places opening up here l=
ike =20
Tandem, Pearls, and Heaven Street. The utilities usually average about  60/=
mo. One-month
security deposit.
I'd like to find someone I have something in common with who would be a  go=
od match
for the apartment- whether short or long-term. I'm a female  singer/musicia=
n and
 performance artist and I work in fashion/high-end  retail in the city. I'm=
 in my
mid-twenties and would like to find  someone around the same age. I'm very =
focused
on my work so it's  important to me to find someone who respects that kind =
of thing.
I'm  obsessed with bands (noise, punk, hardcore, post-punk, shoegaze, and  =
classical)
and into fashion (Rodarte, Margiela, Jil Sander, Ann  Demeulemeester).
I want to maintain the aesthetic that is already in the apartment. I'm  sup=
er clean
so if you're also into cleanliness- like sharing cleaning up  and helping w=
ith taking
out trash and recycling- that's fantastic. No  420 or super heavy drinkers/=
smokers/druggers
please. I am a quiet,   considerate and respectful roommate. I definitely l=
ike to
go out but I  don't bring the party home and I'm looking for the same- some=
one fun
and  peaceful who'd also be into having a friendly roommate chit-chat now  =
and then.
Tell me about yourself, what you're into, and your lifestyle. I  can email =
more=20
pictures if you want.
Thanks and let me know if you want to come check it out!

rand=20

 by a
 lovely young musical couple from Spain who  will be in the apartment until=
 May=20

droom
 will be available to rent  for a longer period of time. This means the ren=
t would
change to $1,200 a  month.
The rent includes all utilities and internet, shared bathroom and a  fully =
stocked
kitchen (tend to try to keep it close to vegetarian with  just chicken or f=
ish.)

While I am away the living room will be available to share with a dining  t=
able,
 desks and couch. When I return in May I use the living room as  my office/=
studio
when I work at home.
I am on the second floor facing north on a quiet residential street with  t=
ree top
views, AC, WiFi, hard wood floors and good clean neighbors,  very safe. Ala=

LIVE/WORK

$950 per month, Navy Yard/South Williamsburg, 400 sq ft, REAL LIVE/WORK
Available: 3/15 or 4/1 through g-d willing
We just signed a lease on a 5,000 sq foot raw space in a sweet little  ivy-=
covered
building near the Navy Yard. It has many windows, 12-foot  brick vaulted ce=
ilings,
roof access and even a small garden area.
Layout isn't completely determined yet, but our initial idea is to have 7  =
rooms
 of 350-500 sq ft (2-3 windows in each one), priced accordingly at  an aver=
age of
$950, which should also cover utilities. If you want a  huge room or hope f=
or a=20
smaller one, let us know, however. There will  also be a quite large common=
/kitchen
area.
We are beginning buildout immediately, and would of course prefer  roommate=
s who
 are willing and able to finance and carry out construction  of their rooms=
, but
 we are happy to work out other arrangements if  necessary. There is still =
work=20
to do on the plumbing and kitchen, but  roommates are welcome to move in an=
y time
for free rent before it's due  on the first of April.

$1400 per month, Crown Heights, Sunny, spacious studio with TONS of closet =
space!
Available: April 1
Sunny, spacious studio in the heart of Crown Heights available for rent.  I=
 have
 to leave the neighborhood, much to my chagrin, and am looking  for someone=
 to take
over my studio.
This isn't one of those cramped, miniature bathtub, kitchen in your  living=
 space
(ew) studios. You walk in, have two big windows looking out  over a tree li=
ned street,
across from a school. The main room has space  for a full or even queen or =
king=20
sized bed, a big coffee table, full  sized couch, dresser or table, and a b=
unch=20
of other junk. There is a  large mahogany built in closet on one wall, and =
another,
smaller closet  next to it. Now, when I talk about closets, let me explain =
something
to  you: I work in fashion and even I have a closet I basically just use fo=
r  laundry
in this apartment. It's nuts.
Big fire escape you can hang out on, and access to the building's funky  ro=
of in
 the summer if you're so inclined. Building is a mixture of  families and y=
oung=20
folks, everyone is super friendly.
Kitchen is separate, full sized fridge, oven, stove and all that.  There's =
also=20
ANOTHER CLOSET off of the kitchen. Full-sized bathroom with  tub and anothe=
r window.
Wood floors, heat & hot water included.
Pets ok!
Super chill landlord, lives off-site but is really good about fixing  anyth=
ing you
might need fixed. It was repainted a nice off-white color  when I moved in,=
 but=20
you can totally paint and do whatever you want.
AMAZING LOCATION. 5 mins to the 2/3, 10 mins to the 4/5/A/C
2 blocks from Franklin Ave and all of the bars, restaurants, natural  food =
stores
your heart could desire. Half a block from Nostrand and all  of the super m=
arkets,
delis, and also restaurants your heart could  desire. Half a block from the=
 most
 magical (and cheap!) juice place in  the city. I like to run to and in Pro=
spect
 Park.
2 doors down from the brand new Crow Hill Crossfit location if you're into =
throwing
tires.
Available April 1 or later (flexible move-in date)

$1400 per month, Clinton Hill, Lovely, furnished one bedroom apartment with=
 wondrous
view!
Available: 3/20/13 through 5/8/13
My partner (writer) and I (documentary filmmaker) will be out of the  count=
ry from
March 20th until the first week of May, and we're looking  to sublet our ap=
artment
during this time. We have a small, but lovely,  cozy, and quiet private fur=
nished
one-bedroom apartment located on the  top floor of a beautiful brownstone i=
n the
 heart of Clinton Hill.
The apartment has a nice layout, a renovated kitchen, lots of light, and  a=
n amazing
view. We are around the block from great restaurants, funky  shops, and the=
 public
library.
We have 2 lovable cats -- one is very friendly, the other is very shy.  We'=
re looking
for someone to take good care of our home, but even more  importantly, some=
one who
enjoys being around animals and would look  after our cats while we're gone=
.
If this sounds like a good fit, please email us and tell us a little about =
yourself.
Looking forward to hearing from you! Thanks and take care!

$750 per month, Flatbush, 11.25' x 13.5' =3D 150 sq. ft. (bedroom), LARGE  =
ROOM IN
 5BR APT 2 BLOCKS SOUTH OF PROSPECT PARK ON Q/B TRAIN
Available: March 12, 2013 through August 31, 2013
I have a bedroom available in my 5BR apartment in Flatbush, Brooklyn. We  a=
re two
blocks south of Prospect Park and the Q train's Parkside Ave  stop. The B t=
rain=20
at Church Ave is also just a quick walk away. It takes  about 25 minutes to=
 get=20
the Union Square. Within two blocks are two  good grocery stores, a fruit s=
tands,
an Indian restaurant, dollar  stores, a laundromat, a McDonalds, a Subway, =
etc.
The room is spacious, has high ceilings, and includes a twin XL bed and  bo=
okshelves.
Our unit is on the second floor facing away from the  street, and is very q=
uiet.
 We keep the kitchen and bathroom clean,  taking turns on cleaning duty. We=
 don't
have a living room or "common  area," so this is not the best apartment for=
 entertaining
crowds or  throwing parties.
Roommates are all mid-to-late twenties males, busily employed, and often ou=
t, so
 the apartment doesn't feel crowded.
Please write introducing yourself if you'd like to stop by and check the  p=
lace=20
out. Absolutely no smokers or pets (sorry). And sorry about the  mess in th=
e photos:
movers are coming tomorrow, so everything is in  disarray.
Thanks!

Available: 03/06/2013 through 03/31/2013
HELLO.
I am a recently relocated wardrobe stylist + visual display artist in  need=
 of an
unfurnished apartment in Brooklyn/Manhattan. I just moved  from Los Angeles=
, and
 am looking for an unfurnished studio/loft/1 br.  space (open to regular re=
ntal=20
or long-term sublet) for myself and my  small black cat-- no shares, please=
. My=20
budget is up to $1400/month.
I'm in my early thirties, a non-smoker, very tidy, and pretty quiet. I  jus=
t arrived
on March 5, and am hoping to move in by the 30th of the  month. I am financ=
ially
 responsible: I'll be walking into full-time job  in Midtown Manhattan with=
 a company
I've worked for the last three  years; I can provide all necessary document=
ation.
I would ideally like something in a culturally progressive area in the  afo=
rementioned
areas in Brooklyn or LES. I lived for the past year in  Downtown Los Angele=
s, so
 I'm very accustomed to a mixture of grit and  gentrification. It was actua=
lly my
last-ditch effort at trying to be an  Angelino before deciding that it just=
 isn't
me, and heading east.
Any information is greatly appreciated. Thanks so much for your time.

$1200 per month, Williamsburg / Bushwick, at least 12x12, Musician / Produc=
er looking
for living / studio space
Available: 3/1/13 through 4/1/13
Hello,
I'm a 28 year old producer / musician - I currently have a separate  studio=
 and=20
living space, but I'm looking for an apartment with a large  bedroom to com=
bine=20
the two - I would need at least a 12x12 room. I'm  looking for anywhere off=
 Bedford
- Dekalb L, or Greenpoint, looking to  move anytime between March 1st and A=
pril=20
1st.
When I first moved to New York, I posted an ad on CL and ended up living  w=
ith a
 couple guys who I've been good friends and music partners with  since, so =
I figured
I'd give it another shot, as 1 BR's and studios are  soo expensive.
I'm initially looking for like minded people who enjoy or make music /  don=
't mind
me making music. I'm not necessarily looking to share my  studio or collabo=
rate=20
musically, although both of those things could  potentially happen. I make =
underground
dance/ house music, ala LCD  Soundsystem.
I work 4 days a week, and would basically be living with my girlfriend  ful=
l time.
My music making schedule is 5 pm - 10 pm weekdays, and all  day Thurs, Sat,=
 and=20
Sunday.
As a roomate, I'm extremely clean and do all my dishes, etc.
Attached is a picture of my current studio, although I would most likely be=
 downsizing
it considerably in this circumstance.
If this sounds like a fit, please shoot me an email!

SEEKING ART STUDIOS

$150 , Brooklyn/Lower Manhattan, Jewelry Artist Seeking Small Space or Stud=
io Mate
Available: Immediately
Hi,
I'm a resin jewelry artist and I'm looking to rent a small portion of  stud=
io space
or I'd like to find someone who is interested in splitting  the cost of a s=
tudio
 space with me.
I require very little room to do my work and I am the perfect person for  a=
 share.
 16 sq. ft (4x4) is plenty of space for me.  I will furnish  all of my own =
supplies.
My max budget is around $150.  I am hoping to  spend less than that since I=
 need
 such a small amount of space.
I am looking for a well-ventilated area where I can pour small amounts  (te=
aspoons
full) of jeweler's grade resin into my pieces and allow the  pieces to cure=
. The
 resin I use is labeled as non-toxic and its smell is  very slight, but I w=
ould=20
still prefer a space that has at least one  window.  My pieces must be left=
 undisturbed
under task lamps while  curing.
I am looking for a studio that is secure and situated in a safe location an=
d that
I can access during evenings and weekends.
I am tidy, considerate, and quiet and my work is compact and neat. I  would=
 like
 to find an arrangement that has the potential to become  long-term, howeve=
r, I=20
am open to short-term opportunities as well.
Please get in touch if you are interested!
Many thanks,
Sylvia

four speakers for quadrophonic sound work. (You are welcome  to use the spe=
akers that are here, or bring your own.) The studio is  ideal for either so=

the building.  We can  negotiate how to best split the time based on our sc=
hedules /  preferences, and I can be pretty flexible about when I go in.<br=

 the  best space for someone who wants to make extremely loud sound.  <br /=

5 per month, Bushwick, 10 x 15, Awesome apartment in on  Jefferson L stop<b=
r /> Available: April 1st through Open<br /><br /> Hi! <br /> I am looking =
for a roommate for April 1st for my apartment off the  Jefferson L in Bushw=
ick, Brooklyn. The available room is 10 x 15 and has  a big window that let=
s in light and faces the courtyard. It's  unfurnished and at the opposite e=
nd of the apartment from my room, so  there is a lot of privacy. The apartm=
ent itself is quite spacious with a  lot of natural light. This neighborhoo=
d is awesome because it's right  by the park and there are a lot of new pla=
ces opening up here like  Tandem, Pearls, and Heaven Street. The utilities =
usually average about  60/mo. One-month security deposit.<br /><br /> I'd l=
ike to find someone I have something in common with who would be a  good ma=
tch for the apartment- whether short or long-term. I'm a female  singer/mus=
ician and performance artist and I work in fashion/high-end  retail in the =
city. I'm in my mid-twenties and would like to find  someone around the sam=
e age. I'm very focused on my work so it's  important to me to find someone=
 who respects that kind of thing. I'm  obsessed with bands (noise, punk, ha=
rdcore, post-punk, shoegaze, and  classical) and into fashion (Rodarte, Mar=
giela, Jil Sander, Ann  Demeulemeester).<br /><br /> I want to maintain the=
 aesthetic that is already in the apartment. I'm  super clean so if you're =
also into cleanliness- like sharing cleaning up  and helping with taking ou=
t trash and recycling- that's fantastic. No  420 or super heavy drinkers/sm=
okers/druggers please. I am a quiet,   considerate and respectful roommate.=
 I definitely like to go out but I  don't bring the party home and I'm look=
ing for the same- someone fun and  peaceful who'd also be into having a fri=
endly roommate chit-chat now  and then. Tell me about yourself, what you're=
 into, and your lifestyle. I  can email more pictures if you want. <br /><b=
r /> Thanks and let me know if you want to come check it out!<br /><br /><a=

 wonderful people her project has sent me to rent my  lovely furnished apar=
tment.<br /><br /> For this time around I will be going away for 6 weeks to=
 Asia for a  project and am looking for a quiet, clean and respectful roomm=
ate for a  short term sublet that has the potential to become a longer term=
 rental.  <br /><br /> From April 3 to May 18 I will be subletting my furni=
shed bedroom for  $900 a month. It is the smaller bedroom of a real 800 sq =
ft two bedroom  apartment in a brand new elevator building. The larger mast=
er bedroom is  currently being rented by a lovely young musical couple from=
 Spain who  will be in the apartment until May 11. Once they leave to go ba=
ck to  Spain for the summer, their furnished bedroom will be available to r=
ent  for a longer period of time. This means the rent would change to $1,20=
0 a  month.<br /><br /> The rent includes all utilities and internet, share=
d bathroom and a  fully stocked kitchen (tend to try to keep it close to ve=
getarian with  just chicken or fish.) Both rooms are furnished with a bed, =
chairs,  storage shelves, a closet, sheets, towels and blankets. My smaller=
 room  has a murphy bed that can be raised to allow space for working at a =
desk  or practicing yoga. The Master bedroom has a bed that can fold up int=
o a  couch, a desk, a few smaller tables and a wonderful antique dining  ta=
ble for eating in. <br /><br /> While I am away the living room will be ava=
ilable to share with a dining  table, desks and couch. When I return in May=
 I use the living room as  my office/studio when I work at home.<br /><br /=
> I am on the second floor facing north on a quiet residential street with =
 tree top views, AC, WiFi, hard wood floors and good clean neighbors,  very=
 safe. Alas there is no laundry in the building, but plenty of  Laundromats=

an Indian restaurant, dollar  stores, a laundromat, a McDonalds, a Subway, =
etc.<br /><br /> The room is spacious, has high ceilings, and includes a tw=

taking turns on cleaning duty. We don't have a living room or "common  area=

/><br /> I am a recently relocated wardrobe stylist + visual display artist=
 in  need of an unfurnished apartment in Brooklyn/Manhattan. I just moved  =
from Los Angeles, and am looking for an unfurnished studio/loft/1 br.  spac=
e (open to regular rental or long-term sublet) for myself and my  small bla=
ck cat-- no shares, please. My budget is up to $1400/month.<br /><br /> I'm=
 in my early thirties, a non-smoker, very tidy, and pretty quiet. I  just a=
rrived on March 5, and am hoping to move in by the 30th of the  month. I am=
 financially responsible: I'll be walking into full-time job  in Midtown Ma=
nhattan with a company I've worked for the last three  years; I can provide=
 all necessary documentation. <br /><br /> I would ideally like something i=
n a culturally progressive area in the  aforementioned areas in Brooklyn or=
 LES. I lived for the past year in  Downtown Los Angeles, so I'm very accus=
tomed to a mixture of grit and  gentrification. It was actually my last-dit=
ch effort at trying to be an  Angelino before deciding that it just isn't m=
e, and heading east. <br /><br /> Any information is greatly appreciated. T=

 /><br /> Hello,<br /><br /> I'm a 28 year old producer / musician - I curr=

tment with a large  bedroom to combine the two - I would need at least a 12=
x12 room. I'm  looking for anywhere off Bedford - Dekalb L, or Greenpoint, =
looking to  move anytime between March 1st and April 1st.<br /><br /> When =
I first moved to New York, I posted an ad on CL and ended up living  with a=
 couple guys who I've been good friends and music partners with  since, so =
I figured I'd give it another shot, as 1 BR's and studios are  soo expensiv=
e.<br /><br /> I'm initially looking for like minded people who enjoy or ma=
ke music /  don't mind me making music. I'm not necessarily looking to shar=
e my  studio or collaborate musically, although both of those things could =
 potentially happen. I make underground dance/ house music, ala LCD  Sounds=
ystem.<br /><br /> I work 4 days a week, and would basically be living with=
 my girlfriend  full time. My music making schedule is 5 pm - 10 pm weekday=
s, and all  day Thurs, Sat, and Sunday.<br /><br /> As a roomate, I'm extre=
mely clean and do all my dishes, etc.<br /><br /> Attached is a picture of =
my current studio, although I would most likely be downsizing it considerab=

0 , Brooklyn/Lower Manhattan, Jewelry Artist Seeking Small Space or Studio =
Mate<br /> Available: Immediately<br /><br /> Hi,<br /><br /> I'm a resin j=
ewelry artist and I'm looking to rent a small portion of  studio space or I=
'd like to find someone who is interested in splitting  the cost of a studi=
o space with me. <br /><br /> I require very little room to do my work and =
I am the perfect person for  a share.  16 sq. ft (4x4) is plenty of space f=
or me.  I will furnish  all of my own supplies. My max budget is around $15=
0.  I am hoping to  spend less than that since I need such a small amount o=
f space.<br /><br /> I am looking for a well-ventilated area where I can po=
ur small amounts  (teaspoons full) of jeweler's grade resin into my pieces =
and allow the  pieces to cure. The resin I use is labeled as non-toxic and =
its smell is  very slight, but I would still prefer a space that has at lea=
st one  window.  My pieces must be left undisturbed under task lamps while =
 curing. <br /><br /> I am looking for a studio that is secure and situated=
 in a safe location and that I can access during evenings and weekends.  <b=
r /><br /> I am tidy, considerate, and quiet and my work is compact and nea=
t. I  would like to find an arrangement that has the potential to become  l=
ong-term, however, I am open to short-term opportunities as well.<br /><br =
/> Please get in touch if you are interested! <br /><br /> Many thanks, <br=
