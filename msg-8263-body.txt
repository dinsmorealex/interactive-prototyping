$1,400.00 Per Month, Clinton Hill/Navy Yard, Brooklyn, Plenty Of Spaces A=
vailable In Beautiful Newly Renovated Bldg! Huge Range Of Sizes/Prices Av=
ailable!
Available: Nov 01, 2014

To anyone looking for a great new studio space to work in, I have been as=
ked to refer you to a new art studio project. I&#39;ve had my studio in t=
he same building for many years now, and it truly is a wonderful place to=
 work!=20

Because it&#39;s a brand new build out, there are many different spaces a=
vailable. The prices begin at $1025-$1350 for the medium-large ones. All =
have massive windows, and and are perfect size for sharing.

And then there are the truly enormous spaces with FAR more space and even=
 more windows. These range anywhere from $1400 - $4000.=20

Each space will have plenty of light and ventilation, as well as a heat a=
nd AC unit in every space. The building also provides gorgeous rooftop vi=
ews, 24 hour access and security, and an enormous loading dock and freigh=
t elevator.=20

For those not familiar with the area, it&#39;s generally thought of as a =
safe, quiet Brooklyn neighborhood. The building is just a few blocks from=
 the G train, with plenty of food options and easy street parking.

I have had my own art studio in this building for almost 4 years, and the=
 management has asked me to help get interest in the new spaces as they a=
re expanding the number of studios in the building. I will be the one sho=
wing the spaces and there are absolutely NO fees involved.

If you&#39;re interested, please text Jordan. I look forward to hearing f=
rom you. Thanks!

$500.00 Per Month, Fashion District, New York, NY, 137 sq. ft., Studio sh=

Available: Dec 01, 2014 through Dec 01, 2015

All included, month-to-month sublease. 1st month rent+1 month deposit upo=
n entering. The pictures attached are of the current setup - that is befo=
re I moved in. This isn&#39;t how I will set it up\ isn&#39;t my stuff in=
 the pictures, but you can see the space and use your imagination. I am l=
ooking for a time-share and we would also split the space. I only use the=
 studio during the day, 4-5 days a week, so you get one day on the weeken=
d, and at least 6 evenings. There are restrooms, a kitchen area and a slo=
p sink on the floor. In the studio there is heating, a ventilation system=
 and AC in the summer. There is currently only an Ethernet cable for inte=
rnet but it&#39;s possible to install Wi-Fi. I am an oil painter. I use v=
ery little solvent to clean up my brushes at the end of the day (not whil=
e painting), but you should feel comfortable with that and with the smell=
 of linseed oil. The neighbors are all artists, hard working and quiet, a=
nd you must be respectful to that. No loud music, no smoking etc. The stu=
dio share cannot participate in the EFA open studios or any other members=
-only events. Not fit for sculptors or anything dusty, large or super tox=
ic (like spray paint, enamel, mineral spirits).=20

$600.00 Per Month, Long Island City, NY, 2000 sq. ft., Beautiful daylight=
, very creative atmosphere.
Available: Dec 01, 2014

I am a designer/builder looking to invite another creative person to enjo=
y their own work space within my workshop. The space has a nice, open lay=
out with tons of daylight and plenty of tools available for sharing. The =
southern facing windows have an awesome view of the city. There is also a=
 terrace for limited use.

I would say the space is most conducive to a jewelry maker or a mixed med=
ia artist. I use the space primarily for woodworking but there are many m=
onths in which most of my work is onsite, away from the shop. At the mome=
nt, I have one couple I am friends with that occasionally uses the space =
for small projects on the weekend or at night. The girl makes jewelry and=
 the guy does small woodworking projects.

Tools available include most woodworking tools, grinding and polishing wh=
eels, a welding and soldering station, a peddle operated dremel (great fo=
r jewelry), and more. The photos of the space were taken with much of the=
 woodworking tools (table saw, jointer, planer, etc.) moved out of the sp=
ace.

The space has a great, creative, laid back atmosphere. It is located on t=
he top floor of the building. There is a man operated freight elevator wi=
th an easy loading dock. All the building staff and other building tenant=
s are very friendly and the staff is extremely helpful. The building is v=
ery convenient to Manhattan and Brooklyn, close to the E, M, 7, G, F, N, =
Q and R trains. It is located a few blocks from both the upper and lower =
roadways of the Queensboro bridge.

$489.00 Per Month, Union Sq., New York, Lovely Union Sq. Studio Share
Available: Nov 15, 2014

We are two costume designers now looking for someone to take the third sp=
ot in our lovely Union Square studio, as our last studiomate has outgrown=
 the space. The new person will have the nice third corner by the window =
and will pay $489/month (a third of the total cost) within a 14&#39;x17&#=
39; studio. Here&#39;s some info on the space:

-Right on Union Square, an amazing location, with the farmer&#39;s market=
 4 days/week right out the front door
-7th floor with windows on two sides of the room - one facing a nice skyl=
ine, the other facing an amazing view of never-ending fire escapes
-24/7 access
-Heat, A/C, electric included
-A slop sink and mini-fridge in the room
-4 wall-mounted shelves that are 4&#39; long reserved for you, sturdy eno=
ugh for books
-Newly renovated bathrooms on the floor
-Wifi already installed for an additional $20/month
-Amazing studio-mates, both costume designers, with one often out of town=
 (so the studio is rarely full)
-Really great building staff - the super is on our floor and very nice an=
d helpful
-Building mostly filled with artists so everyone is pretty friendly

The space is a little tight for a set designer, but would be great for a =
costume, lighting or sound designer, or a director or writer, or anyone e=
lse that mostly uses a desk space/shelving. There are occasionally meetin=
gs in the space, and we would love to share the space with someone that w=
as open to being slightly communal. Also, we are in the process of puttin=
g in laminate wood flooring, and repainting--so the photos are not quite =
accurate, since we have had to move things around--please come by to view=
.

$700.00 Per Month, Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, 200 sq. ft., Office room with =
Private Entrance
Available: Nov 17, 2014

I would like to rent out my extra room as an office space for daily use. =
It&#39;s a cozy room with all brand new furnishings (West Elm sleeper sof=
a, West Elm office chair, wood desk, turkish rug, nice artwork - all bran=
d new). There&#39;s even a record player! I think it&#39;s a great space =
that&#39;s comfortable and inspires creativity/productivity. And I&#39;m =
adding new furnishings to make it better everyday...

The room has a private entrance separate of mine although you would have =
to use the apartment&#39;s bathroom. I would be open to allow use of the =
apartment&#39;s kitchen as well. The apartment has wifi and I would be op=
en to installing a land line and printer if needed. It comes furnished wi=
th office supplies (pens, sharpies, notebooks, paper, etc).=20

The room is located in a great street level apartment in Clinton Hill. Th=
ere&#39;s a coffee shop and grocery store on the same block. Lots of grea=
t restaurants around.=20

I&#39;m very flexible so I&#39;m open to how the room is used but I&#39;m=
 hoping to find someone who doesn&#39;t actually want to live there at ni=
ght (although the room does have a sleeper sofa option). So use anytime f=
rom Monday through Sunday is fine. Staying late, coming early, etc - all =
fine. Only snafu is that the rest of the apartment serves as home to two =
cats who you can shut out of the room but would mean the space wouldn&#39=
;t be a good fit for someone with allergies.

Rent would be $700 month and it would be on a month-to-month basis.=20

in a rear apartment/house.  The apartment is nice, extremely quiet, and h=
as nice size living room.  The access to the apartment is actually in the=

e bed in the room if necessary.  The room is exactly 100 sq. feet and has=
 a nice large closet.  The kitchen is small but doable.  The electricity =

 comedies and comedians.  I am in a band however I have a rehearsal space=
 elsewhere where I rehearse.  I am very easy to get along with and clean.=
  Most of my friends are either artists or musicians.  I like to bike.  I=
 am originally from out west (New Mexico).  I like to cook however I also=
 love to eat out so I do that about half the time.  I love the Astoria ar=
ea as there are many places to have a drink and many different cuisines a=
vailable to you.  It is also a very safe neighborhood.  We are a short wa=
lk from Broadway where there are lots of stores and restaurants available=
.  A laundromat is right on the corner.  The walk to either the Broadway =
stop or the 30 av. stop on the N,Q line is 10 minutes.  There is a very n=

$1,100.00 Per Month, Crown Heights, Brooklyn, Bedroom with Private Bath
Available: Dec 01, 2014

Roommate wanted to share a beautiful 2 bedroom/2 bathroom apartment in no=
rth Crown Heights. Available starting Dec1st.

Apartment: Big, open layout. Lots of windows. Full kitchen with separate =
dining area. Large living room. Very nice sized terrace (currently being =
renovated). Kitchen has everything it needs, and the living room is fully=
 furnished. You don&#39;t need to bring anything but things for your own =
room. Building is filled with families who have lived here for a long tim=
e and young professionals moving in.
Laundry in basement.

Room: Good sized (unfurnished) room with corner windows that face the bac=
k of the building. Past roommates have fit a full sized bed, desk and dre=
sser with no problem. Private bathroom located off the room with access o=
nly for you through your bedroom. It has a toilet, sink and a shower. Roo=
m has its own closet with a place to hang things as well as shelves above=
. There is also a coat/boot closet in the living room to share. Separate =
space to store your A/C unit in the winter.

Me: Friendly, quiet, respectful, and fun female. I am a professional who =
keeps fairly consistent hours: work 8-5ish in Manhattan. I&#39;m also an =
amateur aerialist who spends time on the weeknights and weekends rehearsi=
ng, etc. I have two small dogs who are super friendly, attention-lovers. =
I spend a lot of time with them at the park down the block in the morning=
s and evenings. I&#39;m very independent and busy most of the time. I don=
&#39;t have a lot of people over or entertain frequently. I cook at home =
most nights, but it&#39;s mostly simple meals- in and out of the kitchen =
quickly. I&#39;m a long-time Brooklyn resident (almost 17 years). I love =
going to the beach for the day, college football, watching documentaries =
on Netflix, and being upside down.

What I&#39;m looking for:
Roommate (male or female, no couples!), non-smoker, who works consistent =
hours (not at home) and has a steady income. Someone who loves dogs- not =
just in the &quot;oh, dogs are cool&quot; kind of way... more along the &=
quot;hell, yeah, I love puppy kisses!!!&quot; kind of way. You may also h=
ave a dog of your own if the situation works: our dogs get along and we h=
ave similar styles of care for our pets (ie: you don&#39;t leave yours in=
 a cage from morning until night). I&#39;d like someone that I can have c=
onversations with, but we don&#39;t necessarily have to be best buds. Som=
eone who is independent and looking for a quiet place to come home to at =
the end of the day is key. I&#39;m not looking to share my home with some=
one who is going to bring home random people, frequently wants out of tow=
n guests to stay with them, or likes to entertain a lot. This apartment i=
s very much my &quot;home&quot;, and the space is best suited for someone=
 who wants and appreciates the same.=20

Shared expenses: electric, gas and internet split 50/50. Cable is negotia=
ble. I can take it or leave it. Currently have it but the bill is huge be=
cause Cablevision won&#39;t give me a good package anymore because I&#39;=
ve been a customer too long (crazy!). So, if we decide to have cable, it =
would have to be in your name. They are more likely to give a good deal t=
o a new customer.

Neighborhood: &quot;Historic&quot; North Crown Heights... whatever that m=
eans! It&#39;s mostly residential. I&#39;ve lived here going on 5 years, =
and the neighborhood keeps getting better and better. Small park (Brower =
Park) down the block with off-leash hours for dogs and a great community =
of dog owners. A few blocks north of Eastern Parkway.=20
Nostrand Ave is one block away and has new restaurants and coffee shops p=
opping up all the time. Franklin Ave is a 10 minute walk. Prospect Park i=
s 20 min.
Trains: A/C @ Nostrand, 3 @ Nostrand, 2/5 @ President
Buses: B44 express to Williamsburg just a couple blocks away

Photos: some of the decor has changed and the photos of the actual bedroo=
m don&#39;t do it justice! Best seen in person.

$1,000.00 Per Month, Bushwick, Brooklyn, Light-filled room in Leed-certif=
ied building
Available: Jan 01, 2015 through Jan 01, 2017

Sunny bedroom with a floor-to-ceiling window that opens to an itty bitty =
private balcony! We are seeking one roommate to share our seriously spaci=
ous three-bedroom apartment in Bushwick.

The Building: We&#39;re in a 2-year-old Leed-certified light-filled build=
ing designed by the landlords, who have an architecture firm on the groun=
d floor and live on the floor below us. The apartment includes an eco-fri=
endly washer and dryer (yep, in unit), dishwasher, five-burner gas stove,=
 grown-up-size oven, air conditioning units, and heated floors with a bui=
lt-in Nest system, including your own Nest temperature control in your be=
droom. We have a green roof with solar panels and a view of Manhattan (se=
e photos), and our own balcony off the living room. The bedroom has a noo=
k closet and the aforementioned juliet balcony, and will fit a full-sized=
 bed (possibly even a queen), a small desk, a wardrobe, and a bookshelf. =
Bedroom will be empty for move-in.

Please note: much of the furniture in these photos is leaving with our cu=
rrent roommate (including all bedroom furniture, the orange couch, and di=
ning room table and chairs).=20

The Neighborhood: Bushwick is so hot right now. We&#39;re on the northsid=
e of Bushwick between the Morgan and Jefferson L stops. Its a 7-min walk =
to the L, 10-min walk to the J M Z, and there are a couple of buses nearb=
y. We&#39;re within walking distance of Roberta&#39;s. Bars and restauran=
ts abound, and we&#39;re less than a block from an Associated grocery sto=
re.=20

You: Male or female, mid-20s to mid-30s young professional or grad studen=
t. Please be clean and a non-smoker (though the occasional 420 is ok). Mu=
st be willing to sign a 2-year lease and excited to participate in buildi=
ng-wide composting system. We&#39;re looking for someone mindful of socia=
l and environmental issues who wants to hang out and cook with us and do =
nerdy things like play board games. We&#39;re not looking for someone who=
 uses their apartment as a crash pad -- we want a responsible adult who k=
nows how to live with people and doesn&#39;t bring the party home every n=
ight. We are L G B T-friendly. No couples. We are potentially open to wel=
l-behaved cats, but no dogs.=20

Us: We are one grad student and one post-grad building our careers. Hanna=
h is 25 and in her third semester of grad school, and Katrina is 30 and w=
orks as a freelance research and writing consultant. Katrina is also dire=
cting/producing a short documentary film. We&#39;re both obsessed with fo=
od and food systems and policy (we both studied this in grad school), as =
evidence by the fact that our bookshelves are full of cookbooks and books=
 on food policy and food anthropology. We both have work-from-home (or co=
ffee shops or libraries) schedules, and we&#39;re both really busy. We do=
n&#39;t have a microwave or television and don&#39;t feel like we need to=
 -- but we&#39;re open to either (just no cable subscriptions).

Please tell us about yourself and why you&#39;re interested in living wit=
h us.=20

$1,623.00 Per Month, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York, Huge Room w/ Priva=
te Bath in Brand New Williamsburg Apt w/ Manhattan Views
Available: Jan 01, 2015

Looking for a roommate to sign the lease for a brand new, never lived in =
2 bedroom 2 bathroom apartment in Williamsburg. It&#39;s very spacious an=
d includes new, modern appliances like a dishwasher, fridge, stove, and o=
ven. It even has heating and air conditioning, recessed lighting, and Blu=
etooth speakers throughout the unit. To top it off, the apartment has a b=
alcony and Manhattan views, laundry in building, virtual doorman, and fre=
e gym.

The room is spacious enough for at least a queen bed and includes a prett=
y big closet...and you would have your own private bathroom!

The apartment is conveniently located right by the subway (right next to =
the J/M at Hewes, 7 minutes walking to Marcy if you need the Z/J/M,  and =
10 to the G/L at Lorimer). There is a grocery store right downstairs and =
plenty of great restaurants and bars immediately nearby...it&#39;s Willia=
msburg!

Your roommate (me) is a 30-year old female working in beauty marketing in=
 Manhattan. I spend a lot of time outside of the apartment...I work 9 AM =
- 6 PM most days but expect to be working more soon. I go out a lot on th=
e weekends and am barely home, and also am out a few nights during the we=
ek. I don&#39;t smoke or bring the party home, and am clean, considerate,=
 and friendly...I expect the same from my roommate.

OK, so the gross rent is actually $1825 but because there&#39;s no broker=
s&#39; fee for this 18-month lease with 2 months free, the net rent is $1=
623, not $1825...what a value! Seriously.

Serious inquiries only, please! The move-in date is still a while away (0=
1/01/2015) but units are disappearing fast...it&#39;s not hard to see why=
. I&#39;m looking for someone as soon as possible...you must meet the app=
lication requirements--income of at least 40x rent, 2 pay stubs, 2 years&=
#39; of tax returns, bank statements, and $35 for credit check and applic=
ation. Also need to be able to split $1,000 for the good faith deposit, $=
3,650 for first month&#39;s rent, and $5,475 for the security deposit by =
bank check.

If you meet all these requirements and are interested, please shoot me an=
 email and tell me a little about yourself, and if you have any kitchen a=
nd living/dining room stuff.

$1,350.00 Per Month, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, 1100 sq. ft., Coveted spot - I=
nsane convenience and true privacy for short or long term
Available: Nov 12, 2014

We are a married couple subletting our furnished guest bedroom. Our apart=
ment used to be two separate apartments so it&#39;s large (roughly 1100 s=
q ft) and you&#39;ll be renting a very private, furnished one bedroom wit=
h your own entrance and bathroom.

We&#39;re right next to the Nassau stop on the G train, right in the hear=
t of Greenpoint. You don&#39;t need to go more than 2 blocks for the best=
 shopping and nightlife the area has to offer, plus the Bedford stop is t=
en minutes walk. =20

Here are some details about the space:

- Full size memory foam bed for ultimate comfort
- Plenty of sets of spare sheets and duvet covers
- Private entrance
- Private bathroom (shared shower - we use it but can be flexible about t=
imes)
- Cable TV
- Wifi
- 2nd floor of 3 family walk up - Pre War brick row house - not modern
- Rooftop with view of lower Manhattan=20
- ((We would consider taking the shelves out under the right circumstance=
s, but the bed stays))

There is a mini fridge in the room, but the kitchen is on the other side =
of the apartment. You&#39;re welcome to cook, but no meat or seafood. Tak=
eout is fine, just not in the pans or fridge.

We&#39;d like to sublet for a minimum of 5 months, maximum 1 year (but ca=
n be a little flexible about all of this for the right fit). Rent as well=
 as all utilities and a monthly professional deep cleaning (excluding lau=
ndry) included. We also take care of things like toilet paper and cleanin=
g supplies to make things less complicated. Rent is listed at $1350, but =
we take a flat monthly $1500 to cover all utilities, cleaning and expense=
s.

There are a few small changes from what&#39;s in the photos. The black sh=
elves are completely empty for you to use. The rug, plant and round table=
 are no longer there. You can use the whole wall for a desk, bookshelves =
or whatever you&#39;d like.

There is one short haired cat. He&#39;s not much of a shedder and most of=
 our friends with allergies have no problems with him, but rent at your o=
wn risk. He&#39;s a snuggler so may try to get on your lap during winter =
months.

We are:

married - husband is a writer/comedian, wife works in vintage/fashion
have lived here for over 8 years
clean and tidy
relatively quiet
sometimes work from home

Ideally you are:

relatively quiet
tidy
employed
not planning on bringing tons of strangers home (landlord and neighbors d=
on&#39;t like it)
not into indoor smoking (but you&#39;re welcome to smoke on the roof!)

Get in touch if this sounds like the right spot for you! If you know the =
area you&#39;ll know how high demand is for this location, so please tell=
 us a little something about yourself to help expedite the process.  We&#=
39;re not desperate to rent the room so are more interested in a good fit=
. =20

No pets, no couples. Thanks!=20

We are two 27 year old young professionals looking to create a clean, fri=
endly house of 4 creative and passionate folks. We just signed a lease on=
 a 4 bedroom/1.5 bathroom light-filled apartment in Fort Greene. We&#39;d=
 like to live with people who are interested in getting to know each othe=
r -- up for occasional group dinners, a beer or board game in the living =
room, supporting each other&#39;s projects or hobbies.

Aliya is an artist (www.aliyarosebonar.com), an event planner, a kids sew=
ing instructor, a daily bicycle commuter, a fashion designer, an improvis=

$1,300.00 Per Month, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Beautiful sunny apartment in=
 the heart of Williamsburg - 1 min from subway
Available: Dec 01, 2014

The apartment is a beautiful two bedroom apartment, with an eat-in kitche=
n and a separate living room. The bathroom has a window and a bathtub. We=
 have a a fire escape and a stoop. The room has a window with a backyard =
view, lots of sun, private exit onto the fire escape, and has a separate =
closet! It is the most charming place and the best location I have had in=
 New York. The first place I have lived in that really feels like a home.=


It&#39;s located on a safe and quiet tree-lined street literally a minute=
 away from the L train at Lorimer and the G at Metropolitan, which connec=
ts you to Manhattan and other parts of Brooklyn and Queens in moments. Th=
ere are also many buses  connecting you to Greenpoint, Bed-Stuy and more.=
 Bedford Ave is one stop away and Manhattan 2. You will find yourself in =
Union Square in 7min - I rarely spend more than 20/25 min on the subway.=20=


The neighborhood is great and the surrounding area offers everything you =
need. Walking distance to McCarren Park, great bars, cafes and restaurant=
s, yoga studios, gyms, movie theaters, laundry, dry-cleaners, organic gro=
cery store, supermarkets, Campbells Cheese shop - and shopping at Bedford=
 Ave which is a nice walk or 2 mins on the subway.

A little bit about me. I am a half Norwegian/French girl with an open and=
 positive personality. I believe a good energy and communication is neede=
d for a good and drama free home. I&#39;m laid back and respectful of the=
 people I live with and wish for you to be the same. I like to be able to=
 hang out with my roommate, but I also like my alone time - the perfect b=
alance. I love a nice dinner with wine and great conversations! No crazy =
parties at home though. I enjoy a normal clean (non-smoker) home with pla=
nts and life. I&#39;ve traveled and lived in different corners of the wor=
ld. I&#39;m an actor in NYC, but I also teach Norwegian and French to kid=
s, amongst other things.
=20
I am looking for someone friendly, who is easy to get along with and is m=
indful of others. Someone who is financially stable and pays their bills =
on time, no exception! You should be interested in treating the apartment=
 like a home and keeping it in good shape. Preferably you work away from =
home during the week. Hoping to find someone who is looking for long term=
 accommodation.

Option to buy a bed if you need it.

Plants, pots and pans are very welcome! A few smaller things have been ad=
ded or removed from the apartment, but all in all it looks the same.

Requirements:=20
- 1 Month Rent and Security Deposit

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Thanks and happy apartment hunting,

$1,500.00 Per Month, LIC, New York City, Beautiful, warm, sun-lit room av=
ailable for sublet. Super convenient.
Available: Dec 30, 2014 through Jan 28, 2015

Hello. I will be traveling from December 30th- January 28th and my very s=
pecial room is available for sublet. About the space:

* 1880&#39;s row house with tons of original details throughout. Former s=
ingle family house layout with massive skylights on the top floor.
* Super sunny, super warm apartment, sun drenched and inviting to be in.
* Bedroom gets full sun all day. Queen sized bed.
* Large, private, weird bathroom attached to bedroom.
* Bathroom is mirrored, black, stone tile stand up shower. Very Fellini m=
ovie.
* Sunny, lived-in kitchen with eating nook.
* Roommate who lives on a different floor, so you basically have the floo=
r to yourself.
* Sublet price includes all utilities: internet, alarm system, gas/electr=
ic/heat
* Apartment is super warm even on the coldest days of winter. A great pla=
ce to be during the month of January.
* Must be able to water my plants- I will leave detailed instructions.
* Neighbor downstairs has 2 dogs, just something to be aware of in case y=
ou are allergic.
* People who have seen the place agree that this place is very special an=
d a unique NYC apartment. Very old school and too many places like this d=
o not exist anymore around here.

Other then that, this building is very quiet. Downstairs neighbor, the ro=
ommate, and I much prefer to have a household that is peaceful and is a q=
uiet place to come home to. This is not the type of living situation that=
 is conducive to lots of late night comings and goings or having loud gue=
sts over. Any sort of partying in the house isn&#39;t really going to wor=
k and would not be a good fit for this.

Let me know if you have any questions.

, spacious apartment, 2 blocks from Franklin
Available: Dec 01, 2014 through May 31, 2015

To be closer to a new job, I&#39;m sadly leaving my room in a wonderful 4=
 BD/2 BA apartment and looking to find a longterm sublet and/or lease tak=
eover.

The room has two large windows and a sizeable closet. I share the bathroo=
m with one other person.

The entire apartment is 1.5 years old. All hardwood floors, high ceilings=
, and brick wall accents. Kitchen include gas range, double sink, oven, d=
ishwasher. Stone countertop. We&#39;ve been living here for 1.5 years so =
everything is furnished. My room will be not. Females only, no pets, no c=
ouples.=20

About neighborhood:
We&#39;re right above a laundromat (score!) and two blocks from Franklin =
Ave where there are coffee shops, a cheesemonger, restaurants/bars, dry c=
leaning--everything you need. 8 min walk to the Franklin Ave stop (2/3/4/=
5) and 13 min from Nostrand (A/C), though you can take the S to cut that =
shorter.

About roommates:
3 ladies in their mid-20s. One is a consultant at innovations agency, one=
 in event production, and the other at a tech startup. They&#39;re all fr=
iendly and we go out in the neighborhood for drinks on birthdays and spec=
ial occasions. Two have lived in the city for 4+ years.

Please let me know if you have any questions! (Sorry to take the pics at =
night without natural lighting but you can see by the windows-- lots of E=
ast-West facing ones-- that we can a lot of day light throughout the year=

Available: Jan 18, 2015 through Mar 22, 2015

This is for one private room of a 2 BR, 1 bath, spacious, and new apartme=
nt located in the heart of the vibrant artistic community of Williamsburg=
, Brooklyn. We&#39;re located on the same block as the Bedford L stop so =
it&#39;s extremely convenient for getting around -- you can get to Union =
Square in 5 minutes and we&#39;re only 1 stop away from Manhattan. I&#39;=
ll be in South America and Antarctica for 2 months from January 18 - Marc=
h 22, so those are the dates that the room is available. I&#39;m asking f=
or $3,200 for the duration of 1/18 - 3/22, which comes out to $1,600 a mo=
nth for 2 months. You would be potentially sharing the apartment with ano=
ther guest. I&#39;m also asking for a security deposit of $800.

The room contains a double bed. The place is bright and clean and in a gr=
eat area -- close enough to Bedford, Metropolitan, or Grand to enjoy all =
of the amazing bars, cafes, and restaurants, but just a touch off of the =
main drag to provide a semblance of peace. Also, if you like movies and/o=
r independent cinema, there are some great movie theaters within walking =
distance of our apartment. We are also 5 blocks from the waterfront, wher=
e you can experience some of the best views of the Manhattan skyline and =
also the Brooklyn Flea market and Smorgasburg food festival on the weeken=
ds.

Fresh linens and towels are provided, there is high speed internet and ca=
ble, central AC. Free coffee and tea are available upon request. In addit=
ion, I would be more than happy to provide information about the area or =
Manhattan or help out in whatever way we can.

There&#39;s ample desk and table space in case you want to hook up a lapt=
op and work for a while. Last but not least, our apartment building has a=
 rooftop!

If you need any recommendations, you can ask me and I&#39;ll do my best t=
o help you enjoy the city!

$2,800.00 Per Month, Red Hook, Brooklyn, 1200 sq. ft., Luminous Open Loft=
 Space in Historical Factory Building
Available: Jan 06, 2015 through Jan 06, 2016

Open, 1200 sq.ft. loft space with 14&#39; ceilings and constant beautiful=
 light from seven 8ft tall windows with views of both  Manhattan and down=
town Brooklyn skylines. The building is located right on Coffey Park in t=
he center of Red Hook, just a couple blocks from Van Brunt St. and all ou=
r great bars, shops, restaurants and bus lines. The G an F subway lines a=
re a 15 min. walk into Carroll Gardens, or a shorter but more harrowing w=
alk across Hamilton Ave. to Smith &amp; 9th. There is also the Ferry Serv=
ice to Wall St. with stops at both the Ikea &amp; Fairway docks. Street p=
arking is fairly easy around the building if you have a car. Bicycles may=
 be parked in the courtyard.

Laundries are located on each of the four floors, as are garbage and recy=
cling stations. The loft has a full bathroom with a claw foot tub. there =
is a fully equipped kitchen at one end of the space with a large round di=
ning table and long wooden prep table. There is a single, Sleigh Day Bed,=
 swivel office chair and drafting chair and a window seat. There is also =
a Bose CD/mp3 player amp and DVD player, WiFi and AC. Heating is independ=
ent with thermostat. There is a 6 ft x 42&quot; drawing table and a 14&#3=
9; x 11&#39; working wall for large drawings.

This loft is organized for one person,( although couples have been happy =
here ), as there is no divided space, no roommate arrangements will be co=
nsidered. But there is really nothing like one great big room all to your=
self.

Also, whereas this is the perfect place to draw or work on small models, =
I am sorry that I cannot allow painting or sculpting or power tools.

There are no fees, I ask only a security deposit and first and last month=
&#39;s rent before taking occupancy.

I will be showing the space myself. I have a sublease contract that I ame=
nd , if needed, with the tenant. I must meet anyone personally who will l=
ive in my space and I may ask for a recommendation. I give tenants contac=
t information to the building management and provide tenants with contact=
s for them as well as our wonderful super in case there is any need of im=
mediate assistance.

The room has two huge new windows, and gas heater. The light in the both =
the room and the apartment is beautiful, with afternoon sun drawing it&#3=
9;s way across the walls. There&#39;s a J line that runs outside the wind=
ow, which is a truly unique experience in 2014 NYC. The apartment is on t=
he 3rd floor and we have direct stairwell access to the roof, which is ab=
solutely amazing. =20

Regarding pets; we have 2 time-share dogs who both vary in duration of st=
ay. They are two ladies, Agnes and Cassidy, and are both incredibly sweet=
 and kind natured.=20

picky as to whom we rent the space. I would like a short bio from the pro=
spective tenants. Simple who, what, why. Of course we prefer young profes=
sionals that can enjoy the spirit of the lower east side. Most of the tim=
e my girl friend, or me will show the place and commence check-in &amp; c=
heck-outs. Occasionally if at work or vacation I will get a friend to hel=
p.

end on if it is a business paying or personal.

Hello!

*Please note we have three rooms at three different prices and move in da=
tes, as outlined below* (Dec 1@$990; Jan 1@$795; Feb 1@$935).

Big open airy loft with lots of light, hardwood floors, 12&#39; ceilings,=
 &amp; an arty decor.  On the fourth floor of a converted factory brick b=
uilding, it is snug among burgeoning and burgeoned Bushwick and hipster E=
ast Williamsburg.

We want to live with community-minded, responsible, respectful folks who =
are direct and kind.  We want folks who are down to help clean without be=
ing reminded.  We want folks who are down to offer each other to share th=
e occasional bottle of wine; we want to all take out the trash a bit more=
 than we think we should.

The Building
washers &amp; dryers
fourth floor of a four floor walk up.
cool roof with a view of Manhattan
numerous other apartments filled with twenty and thirty-somethings.
I speak Spanish with and once made cookies for the Ecuadorian car mechani=
c next door.

Large room, two walls of windows, lofted bed area, furnished, about 190 s=
q ft.  $990/month.  Dec 1 move in.  Available through the end of April.  =

This room has 12&#39; ceilings, huge windows facing south and east.  It c=
omes with a desk and dressers, and-- not encroaching on the 12&#39; ceili=
ngs-- there is a lofted bed area that is about 11&#39; by 6&#39; floor sp=
ace with a 5&#39; ceiling, featuring a queen (or double, I&#39;m not sure=
) bed.  A little hallway gives the room added privacy.  Because we have c=
entral heating and you will have wonderful large windows, this room can g=
et a bit colder in the winter unless electric heaters are used, so a few =
of those guys are provided. I have lived in this room for five years and =
I love it.

2.  Room 2 Code Name: Cozy
Smaller room with a south-facing window, furnished, 790/month.  Jan 1st 2=
015 move in.  Available permanently.

ing window.

Neighborhood
Welcome.
Half a block from the Morgan stop of the L train. street parking.
Walking distance from numerous bars, restaurants, and coffeeshops.  Care =
for ramen or sushi?  We have two restaurants for each cuisine within thre=
e blocks.  Famous ol Roberta&#39;s is a few blocks away, as well as a 24 =
hour over-priced organic grocery store.
Just over Flushing Avenue from us, the world becomes neighborhoody and sm=
all business-filled, full of human interaction.  A large park.  Full size=
d grocery store (or visit Trader Joe&#39;s in Union Square &amp; take the=
 15 minute one-line subway ride home).

Our block is industrial &amp; quiet at night.

Furthermore
Hm.  Utilities not included (estimation: 70-110/month).  No smoking in th=
e apartment.  Know some good jokes;).  I am the primary person interactin=
g with the landlord; the agreement between myself and the other folks who=
 live here is that two months&#39; notice may be given by either party.

I am currently out of town, so my plan is to refine the list of good matc=
hes and meet with those folks on Nov 25th.  If we really think you are TH=
E ONE a flatmate of mine could let you in to see the place.

Happy home-hunting!

Best of luck!!
Lauretta

Requirements:
1) First, last, &amp; security deposit.  Security deposit to hold the roo=
m.
2) Rooms are available for one person only.
4) No addtl pets.  A dog normally lives in the house but he will be gone =
until likely April 2015.  After that point, he will likely return (so be =
excited about living with a dog!).  Be down to help take the dog out on o=
ccasion por favor!(!)  Favor-swapping community!  He will cuddle your fac=
e off regardless.
5) At the time of this posting, we have another little critter or two-- i=
e an unwelcome mouse!  We have humane traps up but we will wipe those lit=
tle critters out with more heavy duty means in the next few days.  Presum=
ably this will be all cleared up by the time you arrive.  If it isn&#39;t=
, there may be some pitching in and setting a mouse trap in your future t=
il those little guys find a new home.
6) Understand that the things in this email are all true, and not many bu=
t some are subject to change.  If the dryers in the basement break, pleas=
e do not tell me this posting is a fabrication.  We will call the buildin=
g manager and get the dryer fixed.  You understand how this goes!  This i=
s just an example, we have three new washers and three new dryers, so I d=
o not anticipate it being an issue.
7) We have a lofted area in the living room with a guest mattress; someti=
mes we let guests sleep there.  Not too often.

We are very easy to live with, and hope you are as well.  If you can clea=
n up some and are awesome, great, you might fit in wonderfully.

Good luck!

in the heart of Park Slope
Available: Dec 01, 2014 through Apr 30, 2015

$1800.00 per month, Park Slope, Brooklyn.  Large one bedroom furnished ap=
artment located in the heart of Park Slope. Close to all trains, nearest =
stop is Union Street, but only one stop away form most express trains.  V=
ery safe neighborhood with an abundance of choices for food and shopping.=
  Laundromat is located just around the corner with a Farmer&#39;s Market=
 on Wednesdays &amp; Sundays too!  Barclays Center and Atlantic Center (T=
arget, Old Navy, and other shopping) just straight down 5th Ave. =20

Apartment is available December 1st or prorated starting November 25th ti=
ll end of April with possibility of extension through May if interested. =
 Full deposit required.

I&#39;m looking for an individual to look after my apartment while I am g=
one.  The bedroom is very large and is fully furnished.  There are two la=
rge windows that let in a lot of light and the apartment looks out over 2=
nd street.  The apartment, furnished as well, includes a flat screen tv, =
fully stocked kitchen, full bath, food pantry, and is located on the seco=
nd floor, just an easy walk up one flight of stairs.  The apartment is lo=
cated in a building where all the neighbors know each other so a great pl=
ace to live.  I have lived in my apartment for more than 15 years, so it =
is very much a home. =20

Looking for an individual or the right couple that fits the usual bill:  =
clean, mature, employed, and stable.  The building is relatively quiet so=
 bringing the party home is not a good idea. I want someone who will enjo=
y my apartment, but also keep it clean and show great respect for it, it =
is after all my home.  This is a 5 mos. sublease with a possibility of a =
additional month extension.

This would be a great way to live comfortably and at a very affordable pr=
ice for the neighborhood.  The neighborhood itself has grown and grown ov=
er the years and now has an abundance of restaurants, coffee shops, baker=
ies, bars and stores in which to shop.  We also now have a Farmer&#39;s M=
arket on Wednesdays and Sundays!!  Laundry is located around the corner, =
a 2 min walk.  It is done by a debit card you keep money on and is extrem=
ely clean.  You can also drop off there as well.  Trains are easily acces=
sible.  This is the best neighborhood ever, which is why I have stayed fo=
r so long.

This is my apartment that I have rented since 1999. I am not a broker or =
building manager. I will be showing the space.=20

I require that you fill out a basic application letting me know where you=
 work so I have proof of employment, references of either past roommates =
or landlords etc. Upon choosing, I require a months deposit and that both=
 myself and the subletter sign a sublease agreement so that all expectati=
ons of our agreement are clear and on paper and signed off on.

 Bills are not included in the price. ConEd, National Grid(gas) and Veriz=
on fios internet/cable are the bills. Deposit is returned by certified ma=
il so it can be tracked on the 15th of the month after move out. =20

The apartment can be available on November 25th at a pro-rated rent, if s=
omeone is interested in an earlier move in date.

If you are interested, e-mail something about yourself and what you are l=
ooking for.  I would love to find someone as soon as possible! =20

Thanks for reading!

$1,000.00, Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, Entire 1+ BR Apt (plus cat care) -=
 1 month only
Available: Dec 24, 2014 through Jan 24, 2015

Greetings! I am traveling to India for 1 month and renting out my entire =
1+ bedroom space for discounted rent in exchange for cat care. Looking fo=
r someone who&#39;s only in town for a short time, in between apartments,=
 or maybe has a roommate situation they want a break from! Rent includes =
all utilites and wifi.

The Space: Fully furnished, Medium sized apartment with full living room,=
 bedroom, kitchen, bathroom + an extra little office room with desk and s=
ingle futon. The space is appropriate for a single person or a couple. Wi=
ndows in the front and back of the space- gets both morning and evening l=
ight. Bedroom is in the back of the house so no street noise. Right on Wa=
shington Ave, it&#39;s a 5 minute walk to the subway. All necessities wit=
hin 2 blocks: supermarket, laundromat, restaurants, bars, pharmacy, hardw=
are store, etc. Furniture includes 1 full sized bed, large living room co=
uch, arm chair, dining table, fully equipped kitchen. There is a small TV=
 and DVD player but no cable TV.  As this is just a 4 week sublet no othe=
r large furniture should be moved in. The space is railroad style, there =
are no doors between any of the rooms (which generally works out fine sin=
ce I live alone).

The Neighborhood: I have lived in this hood for 12 years and I absolutely=
 love it. Although much more gentrified than when I first moved in, it is=
 still colorful and diverse yet safe. My block has 2 Jamaican bakeries, a=
 pharmacy, bodega, hardware store, laundromat and is right across the str=
eet from the infmaous Tom&#39;s Restaurant!

The fine print: Subletting this space is agreeing to take wonderful care =
of 2 lovely felines. All their needs will be provided for (food, litter, =
etc). You ideally love cats and know how to care for them. No other pets =
allowed.=20

There is a single futon in the office should you need to arrive or depart=
 a few days before or after my own trip, you can sleep there or on the co=
uch.

Please inquire with questions! Thank you!

$450.00 Per Month, East Village, New York, 300 sq. ft., Great location; C=
harming; Very affordable
Available: Jan 01, 2015 through Mar 31, 2015

One bedroom, three room apartment in the East Village. It&#39;s on East 6=
 Street, between Second and Third Avenues, which makes it very accessible=
 to public transportation:  Second and Third Avenue buses, the Lexington =
Avenue #6 train, the Broadway line N train, and the F train.  The apartme=
nt is in the rear of the building and so is tranquil and quiet.  Two big =
windows face south, bringing in lots of sunlight, and there are a total o=
f 6 windows facing in 3 directions:  south, east and north.  The living r=
oom seats 5.=20

The sub-let goes from January 1, 2015 to March 30, 2015. The rent is a ri=
diculously low $450.00 a month, due to rent stabilization sub-letting law=
s, plus utilities ($130 - $150) and a security deposit.  No key money is =
being asked.

The kitchen is fully equipped with all the usual, plus a blender and juic=
er than can also act as a food processor. It is a big kitchen, with lots =
of counter space.  There are plants in many of the windows, including cul=
inary herbs which the renter can pick and use.

The bedroom has a loft bed that can sleep two, and the living room has a =
futon that opens up into a bed that can also sleep two, so there is a cho=
ice of where to sleep.  It is a &quot;vintage&quot; building and the apar=
tment has not been renovated, so instead of a shower, there is a bathtub =
in the kitchen, which is covered by a removable counter-top, easily taken=
 off when the bathtub is used.  The apartment is a 5 floor walk up.

I am not a broker. I am a tenant who will be traveling. I want someone to=
 occupy my living space while I am gone. I live here and I am the person =
who will be showing the space. I require references from the potential te=
nants. The actual landlord will want to see ID and a resume. The fee is: =
$450 a month rent, plus utilities which is determined by the tenant&#39;s=
 use of utilities. And I will ask for a small security deposit, the exact=
 amount to be determined by my relationship with the sub-tenant.

t shot up Graham Ave to Greenpoint on Manhattan Ave. If you want to put d=
own an additional deposit, you could use my beloved Raleigh road bike.

 of $150/month, depending on how much you use the heat.

I&#39;ll be available to show the space anytime between now and the end o=
f the month. I&#39;d like to meet any potential tenants before renting.

great farmers market on Sundays. Also near to Little Dokebi (Korean resta=
urant), Selamat Pagi (Balinese cuisine), Pie Corps (awesome pie and pastr=
y spot), and Vinnie&#39;s Pizzeria which has tons of gluten free and vega=
n options.

$3,200.00 Per Month, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New and Spacious 2 BR Apartm=
ent Sublet availalable in the heart of Williamsburg, same block as Bedfor=
d L train
Available: Jan 18, 2015 through Mar 22, 2015

This is for a new and spacious 2 BR, 1 bath apartment sublet, located in =
the heart of the vibrant artistic community of Williamsburg, Brooklyn. I&=
#39;m located on the same block as the Bedford L stop so it&#39;s extreme=
ly convenient for getting around -- you can get to Union Square in 5 minu=
tes and we&#39;re only 1 stop away from Manhattan. I&#39;ll be in South A=
merica and Antarctica for 2 months from January 18 - March 22, so those a=
re the dates that the apartment is available. I&#39;m asking for $6,400 f=
or the duration of 1/18 - 3/22, which comes out to $3,200 a month for 2 m=
onths. The apartment can accommodate 6 people comfortably (2 in each bedr=
oom, 1 on the couch, and 1 on a blow up mattress). I&#39;m also asking fo=
r a security deposit of $1000.

One room contains a double bed, and the other room contains a queen size =
bed. The place is bright and clean and in a great area -- close enough to=
 Bedford, Metropolitan, or Grand to enjoy all of the amazing bars, cafes,=
 and restaurants, but just a touch off of the main drag to provide a semb=
lance of peace. Also, if you like movies and/or independent cinema, there=
 are some great movie theaters within walking distance of our apartment. =
We are also 5 blocks from the waterfront, where you can experience some o=
f the best views of the Manhattan skyline and also the Brooklyn Flea mark=
et and Smorgasburg food festival on the weekends.

Fresh linens and towels are provided, there is high speed internet and ca=
ble, central AC. Free coffee and tea are available upon request. In addit=
ion, I would be more than happy to provide information about the area or =
Manhattan or help out in whatever way we can.

There&#39;s ample desk and table space in case you want to hook up a lapt=
op and work for a while. Last but not least, our apartment building has a=
 rooftop!

If you need any recommendations, you can ask me and I&#39;ll do my best t=
o help you enjoy the city!

t. Queen sized bed, small kitchen table with chairs. Closet space. Also h=
as full working kitchen - not crazy big, but enough. I will make more spa=
ce available for the subletter.

I have incredible landlords (married couple with an amazing little kid). =
It is a quiet building/house so looking for someone that is not a hectic =
person or a smoker and will respect the space and my belongings, as I rea=
lly love living there. I will be traveling for work during that time peri=
od of the sublet, I am a surf photographer ( yes I have a lot of surfboar=
ds). Unfortunately no pets.=20

Free, Park Slope, Brooklyn, 175 sq. ft., Housesitting for The Right Perso=
n
Available: Dec 26, 2014 through Jan 23, 2015

December 26-January 23rd - flexible on days - a few before, a few after.
We are looking for a stand up responsible person to take care of a cat wh=
o is both indoor and outdoor and takes 3 meds daily.

We also need said person to know how to take care of a house in case some=
thing goes wrong - call a plumber, fix something, fuse blows, shovel the =
front stoop when it snows, make sure no one leaves the oven on.

The house is a 4-level Brownstone and 3 other people live there in a semi=
-collective friendly house share - we are mid thirties to mid-forties in =
age.

The idea is to have one person responsible for the cat and house in excha=
nge for rent during my absence.

The dates are December 26th (open to a few days earlier) through January =
23rd.
The cat is a spunky 12 year old and needs his 3 meds daily - 2 pills/one =
liquid - food, pets and scratches - it is not difficult to administer - h=
e knows it&#39;s coming.

Needless to say, it is absolutely necessary to like animals or just this =
one in particular - he will sleep on your bed most nights and will be mos=
t appreciative.

Please respond by telling us about yourself or if you have questions and =
we will respond !

Utsubo Park, Osaka, Offering Osaka apt swap for Manhattan over holidays
Available: Dec 08, 2014

We live in Osaka and our apt is new, warm, quiet, clean and bright, with =
an all-glass facade facing Utsubo park, a nice central part of Osaka, clo=
se to trains.  It&#39;s a cute residential area lining the park with moms=
 &amp; strollers, shops, cafes, restos, bars, 7-11, but only a few blocks=
 to downtown-ish business with some bustle and wide avenues.=20
We want to spend the holidays in New York and our dates are flexible (pre=
fer longer).
Looking to swap, prefer downtown manhattan.

From Osaka you can do day trips to Kobe, Nara, and Kyoto.  You can reach =
Tokyo in just a few hrs by bullet train.  It&#39;s a trip.
I&#39;m visiting NYC at the moment, until November 23. So we have a chanc=
e to meet before then.
