th natural
light

I'm an artist looking to share my space in Long Island City, blocks from  P=
S1. The
studio is located on the 3rd floor in a building that is  mostly devoted to=
 art=20

io space
in historic Bushwick art studios building.
Available: November 14th, 2012 through November 30th, 2013
I'm a painter seeking another artist to share my art studio, ideally a one-=
year=20
commitment.
The space gets lots of natural light from two large windows and has 12  foo=
t ceilings;
it's perfect for two artists. There is a fire escape and  roof access with =
gorgeous
views, plus security system and door intercom.  There are five other artist=
s' studios
on the same floor, as well as a  slop sink and lots of wall space in and ou=
tside
 the studio.  Additionally, a large open gallery space is being completed o=
n the
 floor  below us for exhibitions/installations by artists working in the  b=
uilding.
All utilities including wifi, central heat and air conditioning are  includ=

 the monthly rent of $650, divided between us ($325 each).
This is a studio space for two artists, NOT a live/ work situation.
I graduated with a BFA in Drawing from Pratt Institute. I live, work,  and =
make=20
art in Bushwick. I am respectful and I use the studio about  three times a =
week,
 at varying times of the day. I'm fine with working  alongside someone, or =
dividing
up studio times so we can be there  individually. If you are able to commit=
 to splitting
the studio  space-wise and money-wise, send me some images of your work. Yo=
u can
 see  some of my drawings here:  http://www.flickr.com/photos/lilafreeman/s=
ets/=20
I work at an easel, paint  with oil paint, and draw with a number of non-to=

 Open Studios and Go! Open Studios.

storical
building on Union Square West, at the northwest corner of  Broadway and 17t=
h street.
The space currently functions as a painting  studio and  would work well fo=
r a neat
and organized  individual,   working on a reasonably small scale. This is a=
 perfect
situation for an  artist, designer, writer, or other creative person seekin=
g a private
and  quiet workspace.
Situated on the 4th floor, there are 14ft ceilings, wood floors, a large  w=
ork table,
and a 10 x 14ft wall for work and display. Adequate storage  as well.  A la=
rge window
overlooks Union Square and provides panoramic  views and wonderful northeas=
t light.
There are newly renovated bathrooms  in the hall, as well as a work-sink. T=
his is
a secure, elevator  building with 24 hour access and a doorman on weekends =
and evenings.

Union Square is a major public transportation hub and has convenient access=
 to most
subway lines and bus routes.
I am seeking a flexible individual who can work out a schedule with me  tha=
t would
include  some weekdays, weeknights, and weekends, so that you  will be able=
 to work
on your own and have total privacy and access to  the studio. I  am also aw=
ay twice
a year, often 1-3 months at a time,  and in that instance, you would have t=
he studio
entirely on your own.

requesting
a security deposit and references, as well as a  6 month  minimum commitmen=
t

$1250 per month, Gowanus, 750 square feet, The Old American Can Factory  in=
 which
this studio is housed is impeccably maintained and offers an  outstanding c=
ommunity
of fellow artists and small creative businesses.
Available: 1/1/2013 through 6/30/2013
This studio gets nice light and is suitable for painting, sculpture,  photo=
graphy,
digital media, and film editing.  The building is centrally  located a bloc=
k from
the Gowanus Canal (and did NOT suffer in the Sandy  storm) and a few blocks=
 from
 Park Slope.  The Old American Can Factory  houses a dynamic group of artis=
ts, small
businesses, and is truly a hive  of creative activity with great spirit.  I=
t's a
 remarkable place to  work---no kidding.  I will be taking RISD students to=
 Rome
 for the  spring semester so there is no possible chance of more than 6  mo=
nths--and
it is work only, no live-in inquiries.

$690 per month, Washington Heights, 10 x 10, Big, sunny room in a 3 BR shar=
e
Available: November 30th through December, 2013
Hi there,
We are two creative, busy roommates in a nice, renovated apartment on  177t=
h Street
and Audubon Avenue in Washington Heights looking for a  third person in our=
 3BR=20
apt.  The room measures 10' x 10', has two  windows and a closet.  It will =
fit a
 dresser, desk, bookshelf and full  bed and you will still have room for yo=
ga, or
your bike or whatever else  you are into.  Rent includes internet, heat, ho=
t water.
 Electricity,  runs about $30-40 per person, outside of air conditioning se=
ason.
One of us is from Wisconsin, works in an office and is a writer, the  other=
 is French/African/Belgian,
and a writer/painter who works--and  works and works.  Oh, and we're two wo=
men,=20
but our current third  roommate is a (straight male) which has been fine, a=
nd we
 are open as to  gender, age, orientation, and trans-status.  We are differ=
ent ages,
20  something and 40 something, but we get along as if we were both 34.  We=
  have
a lot of common interests, but also have opposite schedules so we  get priv=
acy in
the apt, and no lines for bathroom and kitchen.  Our  third roommate works =
from=20
home and we don't have a problem with that,  but just please air yourself o=
ut every
now and then and don't be the  thing who wouldn't leave. It's nice living w=
ith a
 fellow creative and we  are looking for someone along the same lines.
What we're looking for from you: above and foremost, someone who is  respon=
sible
 about paying rent, cleaning up and contributing to basic  expenses.  This =
is important.
 We keep the common spaces neat, do our  dishes, take out the trash, clean =
the bathroom,
etc.  Seriously, do not  move in and make us miserable.  Please be a non-sm=
oker=20
(not a smoker who  steps outside, sorry), and drug-free (includes 420).
Both of us have been in the situation of being new to the city and  needing=
 a place

$830 per month, Prospect Heights, 11 x 12' rm, affordable apt share in burg=
eoning
artist neighborhood
Available: Dec 1, 2012 through November 30, 2013
Looking for a roommate to share this very affordable 2=BD bedroom apt in  t=
he developing
artist neighborhood of Prospect Heights just minutes away  from the park, m=
useum,
botanical gardens, green market, and in between  two food coops.  New resta=
urants,
cafes and bars seem to be opening up  monthly.  This is a boisterous, but v=
ery safe
neighborhood.  The room is  large with ample closet space, but unfortunatel=
y it=20
is not immune from  street noise.  I wouldn't recommend it to light sleeper=
s.
I am a painter and use one of the bedrooms as my studio, am quiet and  tidy=
, teach
painting and drawing at a nearby university and have a dog.   This is a pet=
 friendly
building so others are welcome.  There's a great  studio building just two =
blocks
north, an indoor bike area, and the  shuttle train is just 3 doors down.  I=
 would
prefer to live with someone  in her late 30's to early 40's with a similar =
lifestyle,
but I'm  flexible.  The apt is also rent-stabilized and newly renovated.  W=
e  would
be sharing the lease so this is ideal for someone who plans to  stay in the=
 area
 for a while.

; brand
new renovation; wonderful neighborhood
Available: December 1st through open
Share the private ground floor of a free-standing single family home  with =
me and
my dog.  Upper two stories are occupied by the owners, a  super Mexican fam=
ily of
five, the kids are incredibly well adjusted  young adults and the parents a=
re warm,
honest people who can maintain a  beautiful home in Brooklyn and raise thre=
e terrific
kids.  We have two  entrances, one shared w. family and one private.  Recen=
tly renovated
 with bright walls, bamboo floors, excellent windows. It's a very warm  hom=
e on=20
an amazing block, I just had the best halloween since my  childhood in Mich=
igan.
 It's a nice quiet place to come home to.
Bedroom for rent is large (+/- 20'x20') with decent closet and PRIVATE  BAT=
HROOM!
Third bedroom is very small and used as closet/laundry room.  Shared space =
isn't
 yet really furnished, and I would genuinely  appreciate another person's p=
resence
being asserted here :-)!!! Backyard  is only concrete and we share it with =
the kids
and their basketball  hoop, but it's a good dog space and plants could thri=
ve in
 the right  planters.
Dogs welcome, mine is a 2yr old painted Mexican hairless bovine (aka  rescu=
ed pit
bull) and she really wants company.  She is a tough dog and  loves to play =
really
rough.  But her current dog roommate is a wonderful  old man who just snarl=
s at=20
her when she goes too far, she backs off and  it's been ideal.  She's proba=
bly 60lbs
(all muscle).  The owners have a  young boxer and I pay them to walk my dog=
 during
the day.
Utilities aren't included in the rent.  Per person approximates: Wi-fi  30;=
 Electric

ised=20
billing to estimate equal distribution over 12  months, I'll estimate 80 ea=

I'm an architect (female), a pretty typical architect, long-ish hours,  tid=
y, like
to cook, politically liberal, relatively sober.
We need a family friendly (pg rated), financially stable, certainly  crime =
free=20
and at least relatively sober roommate.  Credit Report  required. Deposit a=

month's rent to move in.

 1200sf
Sunny Loft, with a Large Lofted Room
Available: December 1, 2012
Our 3 bedroom loft is located 3.5 blocks from the Morgan L train and  about=
 4 longer
blocks to the Jefferson L. If you are familiar with the  neighborhood, it h=
as some
cool things going on for artists and like  minded individuals-- nice places=
 to grab
drinks, get coffee, eat food.  Our home is large and sunny, a corner unit a=
nd we
 have views of the  Manhattan skyline. Our building has roof access, but ou=
r building
is  pretty civil and respectful- so it is mainly used for enjoying the  vie=
ws, enjoying
drinks with friends, tanning, bbqs-- not really wild  roof parties. We are =
1 female
and 1 male in our twenties (not a couple)  and we like to keep good, positi=
ve vibes
among roommates as well as the  home clean. We have a large dog and 2 cats,=
 so you
must be comfortable  and cool living with pets (they are total lovers- plea=
se don't
reply if  you don't like animals- thanks).
Ideally we are looking for someone responsible, thoughtful, clean,  financi=
ally=20
(and mentally) stable. If you fit the deal and what we have  sounds good to=
 you-
 email us for a time to meet up!
More about the room-- although it is lofted, there is a staircase to get up=
stairs
and there is a closet you can stand in.
The rent does not include utilities, which we split 3 ways. 1st month  and =
a deposit
is required to move in. We would like to finalize with  someone by December=
 1.

$900 per month, Fort Greene/Clinton Hill, 800 sq. ft., Well-lit bedroom in =
floor-through
brownstone 2br. apartment
Available: 12/1/12 through a few months
Dear list,
I am looking for someone to sublet the 2nd bedroom in my apartment for a  f=
ew months
beginning in December. The apartment is the top floor of a   three-family b=
rownstone
house on a newly-dubbed historic block. The  block, on Vanderbilt between M=
yrtle
 and Park, is technically in the  Wallabout, a section of Brooklyn original=
ly settled
by French speaking  Belgians, or Walloons.
The room for sublet is small but also the most private in the apartment,  b=
eing=20
that it is at the end. However, you have to walk through my room  to get th=
ere.=20
I have been living here for over a year and have gone  through two lovely r=
oommates
with whom I've gotten along very well.  Living here does require a certain =
level
 of mindfulness, as do most  living situations.
The room has one window and is fully furnished with a double bed, a  clothi=
ng rack,
side table, mirror, and chair. There is a view of a tree  outside, and then=
 the=20
houses across the way.
The rest of the apartment is very open, with a living room, dining room,  a=
nd separate
kitchen. The space is always bright and airy.
A little about me: I work at the trust and archive of an artist in  downtow=
n Manhattan
Monday through Thursday, and I am also in the process  of applying to MA pr=
ograms
in art history and the decorative arts.  Fridays I usually help out at the =
archive
of a Belgian artist in the  West Village. When I am home I tend to chill, d=
o work,
and read. I am  very mellow during the week. On the weekends I usually hang=
 out=20
with my  friends, see art, ride my bike, and run. I also love to travel, bu=
t am=20
 limited to doing so once or twice a year.  I would prefer a female  roomma=
te who
is close to my age, 25, somehow involved in the arts, and  hopefully with a=
 stable
income.
I am originally from a town by the name of Mill Valley in the San  Francisc=
o Bay
 Area, and I came to New York to attend NYU, where I  majored in art histor=
y and
 French. I am actually pretty good at speaking  French, too, so if you can =
do that,
we might get along. There are no  pets, unfortunately.
If you are not familiar with Fort Greene and/or Clinton Hill, they are  bot=
h wonderful
neighborhoods with excellent and diverse architecture.  Fort Greene Park is=
 close
by and has a green market on Saturdays. There  are also some very good rest=
aurants
and cafes, and a flea market. The  nearest subways are the G and C. If you =
bike,
 the Manhattan Bridge is  very close, and probably the fastest way to get i=
nto the
city.
If most or all of this sounds good, I would love to hear from you and  hope=
fully
 meet you! Also, if there is anything I have not mentioned  above that you =
would
 like to ask about, please do.
Another plus is that the area was hardly affected by Hurricane Sandy.  The =
extent
of the damage around here was some downed trees. All power  and internet re=
mained
intact.

$1650 per month, Greenpoint, Cozy small 2bdrm for 2 month sublet in great n=
eighborhood!
Available: Dec 1st, 2012 through Jan 31st, 2013
I have a lovely little Greenpoint apartment - filled with light and  plants=
 and=20
books and in a great neighborhood. I have to go to California  for about 2 =
months
(timing is kind of flexible - dates listed are the  maximum time), and woul=
d like
to sublet my apartment while I am gone.
It's a pretty small place (I think that makes it sweet and cozy!), but  wit=
h 2 separate
bedrooms, both about the same size - one a full bedroom  with bed and dress=
er, the
other one I use as an office with its desk and  shelf space, but it also ha=
s a full
extendable futon and many people  have used it as a bedroom.  There is also=
 a dining
room, a small but  fully equipped kitchen, and a bathroom (no bath, just sh=
ower).
 It's a  perfect place for a couple, works great for just one person (I liv=
e  alone
and work from home - a set up which works great in this space),  and it can=
 work
 for roommates who don't mind being a little bit on top  of each other (I'v=
e done
it in the past and it's been great with the  right person).
The apartment is a 4th floor walk up in an old building.  There are  large =
windows
in every room, and the apt gets great light. The apartment  stays really wa=
rm and
bright in the winter, and the walls are really  thick so I never hear my ne=
ighbors.
 The rent includes utilities (WIFI,  electricity, hot water, heat, gas). An=
d I would
need to hold half a  months rent for deposit, which I would return as soon =
as I=20
get back.
Just around the corner are lots of bars, coffee shops, yummy  restaurants, =
boutiques,
one of the best natural grocery stores in BK,  etc, etc! There are a lot of=
 artists
in the neighborhood, and it's on  the quieter side from Williamsburg and so=
uth Greenpoint
and it has a  great neighborhood vibe - I really love this area. I am right=
 by the
G  train which links up with the L into Manhattan. And the apt is also  rig=
ht by
 the 7 train and it takes 20 mins to get to Times Square.
I love this place and would like to find someone who will treat it like a  =
home.
  As I mentioned, I'm a little flexible with timing, so please let  me know=
 if the
exact timing listed above doesn't work or if you would  want to sublet it f=
or a=20
shorter time.
Thank you!
- Hannah

Available: 05.01.2013 through 31.05.2012
Hi there
We are a couple in your mid 20's from Copenhagen, Denmark, looking for a  n=
ice and
cosy place to live during our upcoming stay in NY. I (Katrine,  the girl in=
 the=20
couple) am a master student of psychology, and I am  going to do my practic=
um at
 a research center in NY from January 5th -  end of May 2013. My lovely boy=
friend
(Mads) will be joining me in three  months from February - April, where he =
will=20
be studying music at a music  production school. We are SO excited, and loo=
k very
much forward to  this amazing experience - though, we do not know where to =
live=20
yet, but  maybe you can help?
We are both interested in living in an area with a lot of city-life, but  a=
t the
 same time safe and friendly for two foreigners, who probably  will get los=
t a couple
of times... Also, since both our schools are  located in downtown Manhattan=
, we=20
would like to be able to reach them in  no longer than 20 minutes by public=
 transportation.
We are looking for either a private apartment, furnished, with cooking  spa=
ce and
internet (max. 2000$/month) or become someone's roommates  (max. 1400$/mont=
h)
Something about us: I (Katrine) am 24 years old, have been studying  psycho=
logy=20
during the last 4,5 years at the University of Copenhagen. I  love to cook,=
 dance
and windsurf and consider my self to be very  organized - I enjoy neat surr=
oundings.
I (Mads) am 26, work as a DJ in  Copenhagen and make my own music - I am go=
ing to
work more on this in  NY. We live together in DK but have both been sharing=
 apartments
with  others for several years, and are therefore used to be considerate of=
  other
people, and understand how much it means to take care of where you  live an=
d keep
the place clean. We are both non-smokers and (if we may  say so ourselves) =
are very
nice and honest people - so you can trust us  with your apt or room!
We hope to hear from you, and do not hesitate to ask whatever you need to k=
now...
Best Katrine & Mads

Available: Dec. 1 lease start date
Hello!
I'm a female journalist and writer, 31, who is relocating to New York  for =
a new
 job this month. I'm looking for a place to live, and at this  point I'm op=
en to
 either a studio or 1 bedroom of my own, or my own room  in a shared apartm=
ent with
one or two other people.
My philosophy as a roommate (which I have plenty of experience with,  most =
recently
when I lived in Germany 2008-2010 and in Boston 2004-2008)  is laid back, b=
ut I=20
absolutely recognize the necessity of paying rent  and bills on time or ear=
ly (I've
been on the receiving end of an  unreliable roommate situation, and I'd nev=
er want
to put anyone in that  position). I'm easy to get along with, but it's impo=
rtant
 for me to have  clean common areas (bathroom, kitchen, living room). When =
I live
by  myself, I wash dishes daily (or stick them in the dishwasher) and clean=
  my=20
bathroom (scrub toilet, mop/wet swiffer the floor, clean tub and  sink) eve=
ry other
week. I'm LGBTQ-friendly, and a nonsmoker.
Here are my criteria:
- Heat and hot water included
- under $1800/month
- Hardwood floors or tile (no carpet)
- Allows cats (I have a friendly, laid-back cat named Iris)
- would LOVE to have a dishwasher in-unit
- SAFE enough neighborhood that I can walk home from the subway after midni=
ght/early
mornings after a late or overnight shift.
- Within 15 minutes walk of subway to 1,2,3 or A,C,E; or within 10 minutes =
walk=20
of a subway connecting to those lines.
If you can offer something that checks off most of those boxes, please get =
in touch!

Hi! I'm looking to rent (or sublet) a one bedroom apartment in Brooklyn.  M=
y main
requirements are for a place with lots of light, quiet enough  (since I wri=
te at
 home), close enough to public transportation and  essentials (groceries, r=
estaurants,
metro in walking distance -- doesn't  have to be hopping with cafes etc), a=
nd preferably
with access to some  cool running/biking areas (a park, a seaside promenade=
, a bridge),
and a  decent-sized kitchen (I like to cook.) If there is a den/office/alco=
ve  with
lots of light that I can transform into a writing place, that would  seal t=
he deal.
About me: I'm a writer, lapsed computer scientist, working on a novel. I  q=
uit my
job researching search engines to finish my book. I'm clean,  quiet, respon=
sible,
non-smoker, a considerate neighbor, and will take  good care of the place. =
I'm looking
for a permanent place to call home,  but a long-term sublet (3+ months or m=
ore)=20
would work too!
(The neighborhoods/rent/start-dates are somewhat flexible, so do contact  m=
e if=20
you know something thats fits my other requirements.)

br /> We are two creative, busy roommates in a nice, renovated apartment on=
  177th Street and Audubon Avenue in Washington Heights looking for a  thir=
d person in our 3BR apt.  The room measures 10' x 10', has two  windows and=
 a closet.  It will fit a dresser, desk, bookshelf and full  bed and you wi=
ll still have room for yoga, or your bike or whatever else  you are into.  =
Rent includes internet, heat, hot water.  Electricity,  runs about $30-40 p=
er person, outside of air conditioning season.<br /> <br /> One of us is fr=
om Wisconsin, works in an office and is a writer, the  other is French/Afri=
can/Belgian, and a writer/painter who works--and  works and works.  Oh, and=
 we're two women, but our current third  roommate is a (straight male) whic=
h has been fine, and we are open as to  gender, age, orientation, and trans=
-status.  We are different ages, 20  something and 40 something, but we get=
 along as if we were both 34.  We  have a lot of common interests, but also=
 have opposite schedules so we  get privacy in the apt, and no lines for ba=
throom and kitchen.  Our  third roommate works from home and we don't have =
a problem with that,  but just please air yourself out every now and then a=
nd don't be the  thing who wouldn't leave. It's nice living with a fellow c=
reative and we  are looking for someone along the same lines. <br /> <br />=
 What we're looking for from you: above and foremost, someone who is  respo=
nsible about paying rent, cleaning up and contributing to basic  expenses. =
 This is important.  We keep the common spaces neat, do our  dishes, take o=
ut the trash, clean the bathroom, etc.  Seriously, do not  move in and make=
 us miserable.  Please be a non-smoker (not a smoker who  steps outside, so=
rry), and drug-free (includes 420).<br /> <br /> Both of us have been in th=
e situation of being new to the city and  needing a place to land and look =
for a job so we're open to someone who  is in that position.  We want assur=
ance that you can cover rent and  utilities for three or four months if you=
 are coming to look for work.  <br /> <br /> We're looking for a deposit, f=
irst month's rent, and a general sense that you are a decent person.  <br /=
> <br /> Pets...it depends on what you have and how good of a pet owner you=
 are. <br /> The building allows pets.  <br /> <br /> We are 4 blocks away =
from the A train and 4 blocks from the 1 train and<br /> bus lines.  <br />=
 <br /> Please email us to say hi and tell us something about yourself if y=
ou  are interested.  I am sorry not to have photos in time for the  ad--Hur=
ricane Sandy temporarily separated me from the camera I want to  use (I thi=
nk cheap sell phone pictures are scary).  If you request them  in your emai=
l I will gladly send.<br /><br /> Local Transportation: A train, 1 train an=

0 per month, Prospect Heights, 11 x 12' rm, affordable apt share in burgeon=
ing artist neighborhood<br /> Available: Dec 1, 2012 through November 30, 2=
013<br /><br /> Looking for a roommate to share this very affordable 2=BD b=
edroom apt in  the developing artist neighborhood of Prospect Heights just =
minutes away  from the park, museum, botanical gardens, green market, and i=
n between  two food coops.  New restaurants, cafes and bars seem to be open=
ing up  monthly.  This is a boisterous, but very safe neighborhood.  The ro=
om is  large with ample closet space, but unfortunately it is not immune fr=
om  street noise.  I wouldn't recommend it to light sleepers.  <br /> <br /=
> I am a painter and use one of the bedrooms as my studio, am quiet and  ti=
dy, teach painting and drawing at a nearby university and have a dog.   Thi=
s is a pet friendly building so others are welcome.  There's a great  studi=
o building just two blocks north, an indoor bike area, and the  shuttle tra=
in is just 3 doors down.  I would prefer to live with someone  in her late =
30's to early 40's with a similar lifestyle, but I'm  flexible.  The apt is=
 also rent-stabilized and newly renovated.  We  would be sharing the lease =
so this is ideal for someone who plans to  stay in the area for a while.<br=

1st through open<br /><br /> Share the private ground floor of a free-stand=

 by the owners, a  super Mexican family of five, the kids are incredibly we=

aintain a  beautiful home in Brooklyn and raise three terrific kids.  We ha=
ve two  entrances, one shared w. family and one private.  Recently renovate=
d  with bright walls, bamboo floors, excellent windows. It's a very warm  h=
ome on an amazing block, I just had the best halloween since my  childhood =
in Michigan. It's a nice quiet place to come home to.<br /> <br /> Bedroom =
for rent is large (+/- 20'x20') with decent closet and PRIVATE  BATHROOM! T=
hird bedroom is very small and used as closet/laundry room.  Shared space i=
sn't yet really furnished, and I would genuinely  appreciate another person=
's presence being asserted here :-)!!! Backyard  is only concrete and we sh=
are it with the kids and their basketball  hoop, but it's a good dog space =
and plants could thrive in the right  planters.<br /> <br /> Dogs welcome, =
mine is a 2yr old painted Mexican hairless bovine (aka  rescued pit bull) a=
nd she really wants company.  She is a tough dog and  loves to play really =
rough.  But her current dog roommate is a wonderful  old man who just snarl=

probably 60lbs (all muscle).  The owners have a  young boxer and I pay them=
 to walk my dog during the day.<br /> <br /> Utilities aren't included in t=
he rent.  Per person approximates: Wi-fi  30; Electric 20 winter, 60 summer=
; Gas winter bills remain to be seen  and I've just revised billing to esti=
mate equal distribution over 12  months, I'll estimate 80 each. <br /> <br =
/> I'm an architect (female), a pretty typical architect, long-ish hours,  =
tidy, like to cook, politically liberal, relatively sober.  <br /> <br /> W=
e need a family friendly (pg rated), financially stable, certainly  crime f=
ree and at least relatively sober roommate.  Credit Report  required. Depos=
it and one month's rent to move in.<br /><br /> <a style=3D"color: black;" =

 with friends, tanning, bbqs-- not really wild  roof parties. We are 1 fema=
le and 1 male in our twenties (not a couple)  and we like to keep good, pos=
itive vibes among roommates as well as the  home clean. We have a large dog=
 and 2 cats, so you must be comfortable  and cool living with pets (they ar=

artment is on the second floor. The  room is $950/mo and this includes Inte=
rnet, heat and electric. The room  is medium sized, 11x11.5 feet, has two w=
indows facing the backyard and  has a closet with storage space above. The =
apartment is in Bushwick on  Himrod St. between Irving and Knickerbocker.  =
The two bedrooms are on  opposite ends of the apartment - separated by the =
kitchen, living room  and bathroom - great for privacy. <br /> <br /> Move =
in date is Dec. 1st, or earlier if you are able. <br /> <br /> I am a 35-ye=
ar-old queer female who works as gardener and filmmaker.  I  have an MFA fr=
om UCSD and can often be found reading and writing. I'm  putting together a=
 project and am quite focused on it when I am home.   This is a clean quiet=
 apartment good for someone who wants to re-charge,  cook, reflect, read, e=
tc. <br /> <br /> I have a small 9-year-old dog, Harvey. You must like dogs=
. No other pets. No couples. <br /> <br /> I am looking for a responsible, =
mature person with good communications  skills, who is tidy in common space=
s and cleans. I would live best with  someone in their 30's but am open to =
mature late 20's. No heavy drinkers  or drug users. No smoking in the house=
. Hoping to find a friendly  person with good vibes, who understands bounda=
ries and can pay the rent.  <br /> <br /> Short term or long term OK. One m=
onth deposit and December rent to move in. <br /> <br /> Thanks!!<br /><br =

I am  exceptionally easy to get along and communicate with. I respect  boun=

 honest. Guests are welcome, but the  apartment should generally be more of=
 a sanctuary than a social hub.<br /> <br /> To move in you will need to pa=

0 per month, Fort Greene/Clinton Hill, 800 sq. ft., Well-lit bedroom in flo=
or-through brownstone 2br. apartment<br /> Available: 12/1/12 through a few=
 months<br /><br /> Dear list, <br /> I am looking for someone to sublet th=
e 2nd bedroom in my apartment for a  few months beginning in December. The =
apartment is the top floor of a   three-family brownstone house on a newly-=
dubbed historic block. The  block, on Vanderbilt between Myrtle and Park, i=
s technically in the  Wallabout, a section of Brooklyn originally settled b=
y French speaking  Belgians, or Walloons. <br /> <br /> The room for sublet=
 is small but also the most private in the apartment,  being that it is at =
the end. However, you have to walk through my room  to get there. I have be=
en living here for over a year and have gone  through two lovely roommates =
with whom I've gotten along very well.  Living here does require a certain =
level of mindfulness, as do most  living situations.<br /> <br /> The room =
has one window and is fully furnished with a double bed, a  clothing rack, =
side table, mirror, and chair. There is a view of a tree  outside, and then=
 the houses across the way. <br /> <br /> The rest of the apartment is very=
 open, with a living room, dining room,  and separate kitchen. The space is=
 always bright and airy.<br /> <br /> A little about me: I work at the trus=
t and archive of an artist in  downtown Manhattan Monday through Thursday, =
and I am also in the process  of applying to MA programs in art history and=
 the decorative arts.  Fridays I usually help out at the archive of a Belgi=
an artist in the  West Village. When I am home I tend to chill, do work, an=
d read. I am  very mellow during the week. On the weekends I usually hang o=
ut with my  friends, see art, ride my bike, and run. I also love to travel,=
 but am  limited to doing so once or twice a year.  I would prefer a female=
  roommate who is close to my age, 25, somehow involved in the arts, and  h=
opefully with a stable income.<br /> <br /> I am originally from a town by =
the name of Mill Valley in the San  Francisco Bay Area, and I came to New Y=
ork to attend NYU, where I  majored in art history and French. I am actuall=
y pretty good at speaking  French, too, so if you can do that, we might get=
 along. There are no  pets, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> If you are not fam=
iliar with Fort Greene and/or Clinton Hill, they are  both wonderful neighb=
orhoods with excellent and diverse architecture.  Fort Greene Park is close=
 by and has a green market on Saturdays. There  are also some very good res=
taurants and cafes, and a flea market. The  nearest subways are the G and C=
. If you bike, the Manhattan Bridge is  very close, and probably the fastes=
t way to get into the city. <br /> <br /> If most or all of this sounds goo=
d, I would love to hear from you and  hopefully meet you! Also, if there is=
 anything I have not mentioned  above that you would like to ask about, ple=
ase do. <br /> <br /> Another plus is that the area was hardly affected by =
Hurricane Sandy.  The extent of the damage around here was some downed tree=
s. All power  and internet remained intact.<br /><br /> <a style=3D"color: =

50 per month, Greenpoint, Cozy small 2bdrm for 2 month sublet in great neig=
hborhood!<br /> Available: Dec 1st, 2012 through Jan 31st, 2013<br /><br />=
 I have a lovely little Greenpoint apartment - filled with light and  plant=
s and books and in a great neighborhood. I have to go to California  for ab=
out 2 months (timing is kind of flexible - dates listed are the  maximum ti=
me), and would like to sublet my apartment while I am gone. <br /> <br /> I=
t's a pretty small place (I think that makes it sweet and cozy!), but  with=
 2 separate bedrooms, both about the same size - one a full bedroom  with b=
ed and dresser, the other one I use as an office with its desk and  shelf s=
pace, but it also has a full extendable futon and many people  have used it=
 as a bedroom.  There is also a dining room, a small but  fully equipped ki=
tchen, and a bathroom (no bath, just shower).  It's a  perfect place for a =
couple, works great for just one person (I live  alone and work from home -=
 a set up which works great in this space),  and it can work for roommates =
who don't mind being a little bit on top  of each other (I've done it in th=
e past and it's been great with the  right person).  <br /> <br /> The apar=
tment is a 4th floor walk up in an old building.  There are  large windows =
in every room, and the apt gets great light. The apartment  stays really wa=
rm and bright in the winter, and the walls are really  thick so I never hea=
r my neighbors.  The rent includes utilities (WIFI,  electricity, hot water=
, heat, gas). And I would need to hold half a  months rent for deposit, whi=
ch I would return as soon as I get back. <br /> <br /> Just around the corn=
er are lots of bars, coffee shops, yummy  restaurants, boutiques, one of th=
e best natural grocery stores in BK,  etc, etc! There are a lot of artists =
in the neighborhood, and it's on  the quieter side from Williamsburg and so=
uth Greenpoint and it has a  great neighborhood vibe - I really love this a=
rea. I am right by the G  train which links up with the L into Manhattan. A=
nd the apt is also  right by the 7 train and it takes 20 mins to get to Tim=
es Square.<br /> <br /> I love this place and would like to find someone wh=
o will treat it like a  home.  As I mentioned, I'm a little flexible with t=
iming, so please let  me know if the exact timing listed above doesn't work=
 or if you would  want to sublet it for a shorter time.  <br /> <br /> Than=
k you!<br /> - Hannah<br /><br /> <a style=3D"color: black;" shape=3D"rect"=

tay in NY. I (Katrine,  the girl in the couple) am a master student of psyc=
hology, and I am  going to do my practicum at a research center in NY from =
January 5th -  end of May 2013. My lovely boyfriend (Mads) will be joining =
me in three  months from February - April, where he will be studying music =
at a music  production school. We are SO excited, and look very much forwar=
d to  this amazing experience - though, we do not know where to live yet, b=
ut  maybe you can help?<br /> <br /> We are both interested in living in an=
 area with a lot of city-life, but  at the same time safe and friendly for =
two foreigners, who probably  will get lost a couple of times... Also, sinc=
e both our schools are  located in downtown Manhattan, we would like to be =
able to reach them in  no longer than 20 minutes by public transportation. =
<br /> <br /> We are looking for either a private apartment, furnished, wit=
h cooking  space and internet (max. 2000$/month) or become someone's roomma=
tes  (max. 1400$/month)<br /> <br /> Something about us: I (Katrine) am 24 =
years old, have been studying  psychology during the last 4,5 years at the =
University of Copenhagen. I  love to cook, dance and windsurf and consider =
my self to be very  organized - I enjoy neat surroundings. I (Mads) am 26, =
work as a DJ in  Copenhagen and make my own music - I am going to work more=
 on this in  NY. We live together in DK but have both been sharing apartmen=
ts with  others for several years, and are therefore used to be considerate=
 of  other people, and understand how much it means to take care of where y=
ou  live and keep the place clean. We are both non-smokers and (if we may  =
say so ourselves) are very nice and honest people - so you can trust us  wi=
th your apt or room! <br /> <br /> We hope to hear from you, and do not hes=
itate to ask whatever you need to know...<br /> Best Katrine & Mads<br /><b=

Digital Journalist and cat seek apartment/room<br /> Available: Dec. 1 leas=
e start date<br /><br /> Hello! <br /> I'm a female journalist and writer, =
31, who is relocating to New York  for a new job this month. I'm looking fo=
r a place to live, and at this  point I'm open to either a studio or 1 bedr=
oom of my own, or my own room  in a shared apartment with one or two other =
people. <br /> <br /> My philosophy as a roommate (which I have plenty of e=
xperience with,  most recently when I lived in Germany 2008-2010 and in Bos=
ton 2004-2008)  is laid back, but I absolutely recognize the necessity of p=
aying rent  and bills on time or early (I've been on the receiving end of a=
n  unreliable roommate situation, and I'd never want to put anyone in that =
 position). I'm easy to get along with, but it's important for me to have  =
clean common areas (bathroom, kitchen, living room). When I live by  myself=
, I wash dishes daily (or stick them in the dishwasher) and clean  my bathr=
oom (scrub toilet, mop/wet swiffer the floor, clean tub and  sink) every ot=
her week. I'm LGBTQ-friendly, and a nonsmoker.<br /> <br /> Here are my cri=
teria:<br /> - Heat and hot water included<br /> - under $1800/month<br /> =
- Hardwood floors or tile (no carpet)<br /> - Allows cats (I have a friendl=
y, laid-back cat named Iris)<br /> - would LOVE to have a dishwasher in-uni=
t<br /> - SAFE enough neighborhood that I can walk home from the subway aft=
er midnight/early mornings after a late or overnight shift.<br /> - Within =
15 minutes walk of subway to 1,2,3 or A,C,E; or within 10 minutes walk of a=
 subway connecting to those lines.<br /> <br /> If you can offer something =
that checks off most of those boxes, please get in touch!<br /><br /> Pleas=

> Hi! I'm looking to rent (or sublet) a one bedroom apartment in Brooklyn. =
 My main requirements are for a place with lots of light, quiet enough  (si=
nce I write at home), close enough to public transportation and  essentials=
 (groceries, restaurants, metro in walking distance -- doesn't  have to be =
hopping with cafes etc), and preferably with access to some  cool running/b=
iking areas (a park, a seaside promenade, a bridge), and a  decent-sized ki=
tchen (I like to cook.) If there is a den/office/alcove  with lots of light=
 that I can transform into a writing place, that would  seal the deal.<br /=
> <br /> About me: I'm a writer, lapsed computer scientist, working on a no=
vel. I  quit my job researching search engines to finish my book. I'm clean=
,  quiet, responsible, non-smoker, a considerate neighbor, and will take  g=
ood care of the place. I'm looking for a permanent place to call home,  but=
 a long-term sublet (3+ months or more) would work too!<br /> <br /> (The n=
eighborhoods/rent/start-dates are somewhat flexible, so do contact  me if y=
ou know something thats fits my other requirements.)<br /><br /> Please con=
